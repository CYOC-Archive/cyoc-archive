<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>CW: Mentioned  underage sex</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy slowly opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was the ceiling. As her vision cleared, she noticed her surroundings. The mall was in utter chaos, clothing strewn everywhere. People ran around frantically, Some crying, while others seemed to be in a daze. The sexual activities had died down somewhat, but there were still a few couples and groups going at it in various spots throughout the mall.<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s hand instinctively went down to her crotch as she felt the wetness between her legs. Her pussy was still tingling from the intense orgasms she had experienced with her mother just moments ago. She took a deep breath and tried to ignore the overwhelming sensation, not quite sure how to process what had happened between them or what to call it. She turned her head to see her mother lying next to her, fast asleep. Her white hair was a mess and her face was flushed from the intense lovemaking they had shared earlier. Amy couldn&#39;t help but smile as she looked at her. That felt so good and she wanted to do it again!<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a loud voice rang out through the mall. &quot;Attention everyone!&quot; A loli with cat ears stood atop a nearby counter. &quot;We need to decide what we&#39;re going to do next! We can&#39;t stay here forever, but going outside could be dangerous. We need to weigh our options carefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
A hushed murmur spread through the crowd as everyone started discussing the dilemma. Amy sat up and looked around at all the other lolis. They were so different from each other, and she wanted to play with all of them, too! All stood there naked, too, some with penises erect, or cunts glistening with love juice. She squeezed her thighs together, feeling that same urge again. <br />
<br />
A girl with fairy wings raised her hand. &quot;I think we should stay here for now,&quot; she said softly. &quot;We have food, shelter, and we know it&#39;s safe. If we go outside, we could infect other people and who knows how they&#39;d react to us.&quot; Several lolis nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
However, another loli, this one with green skin, spoke up. &quot;But we can&#39;t stay here! What about our families? Our friends? We need to try to get back to them.&quot; This sentiment also received a round of support. <br />
<br />
Amy glanced at her sleeping mother again, unsure what the right decision was. On one hand, she felt safe and secure here with the other lolis and her mom. But on the other hand, she knew that her father would be worried sick about them both. And the other families outside this mall were probably terrified about what was happening too...<br />
<br />
Just then, Sarah began to stir beside Amy. She opened her eyes and looked around the room, trying to process where they were. &quot;What...what happened to us?&quot; she asked, looking down at her own small, perfect body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Amy replied honestly. &quot;But whatever it was, it changed us into little girls like these others. I mean the adutls and boys.&quot; She gestured to the crowd around them. <br />
<br />
Sarah looked at all the naked loli bodies surrounding her, some of them still coupled in sexual acts. Her eyes widened in shock. She covered her chest instinctively. The pleasure still pulsed within her from earlier and the sight of other sexy lolis didn&#39;t help matters. Her clit throbbed.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered what she did to her daughter.<br />
<br />
Sarah hugged her daughter tightly. &quot;I know we just...did something naughty together,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#39;m sorry baby. I don&#39;t know what came over me. You&#39;re my little girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? That felt good didn&#39;t it? Don&#39;t be sorry Mommy.&quot; Amy hugged her back fiercely. &quot;I liked doing those things with you! I want to do it again.&quot; Her crotch throbbed as she imagined her mommy&#39;s finger in there again.<br />
<br />
Sarah blushed hard and was about to protest further when the cat-eared loli cleared her throat and spoke again. &quot;Okay everyone, I have an idea,&quot; she announced. &quot; I say that we do some democracy! A vote&quot; The crowd seemed to like this idea and quickly quieted down.&quot;Does anybody want to volunteers to count the votes? It might be good to have a few people so there&#39;s no funny business.&quot;<br />
 <br />
After a brief pause, three lolis volunteered to help count the votes. The first one was a dog girl with short fur in shades of brown. She had a friendly, energetic expression and seemed eager to help out. &quot;I&#39;ll count the votes!&quot; she called out, her tail wagging excitedly. <br />
<br />
Next, an elf loli with pointy ears and green hair raised her hand. &quot;I can help count too,&quot; she said, her voice sweet and melodious. &quot;It&#39;ll be fun!&quot; <br />
<br />
Finally, a small normal-looking loli stepped forward. She had a no-nonsense look on her face and held herself with confidence, despite her small size. &quot;I&#39;ll oversee the counting to make sure it&#39;s done fairly,&quot; she stated matter-of-factly. &quot;I&#39;m good at math.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd began to debate amongst themselves again as they tried to decide whether staying or going was the right choice. Amy looked over at her mom and squeezed her hand reassuringly. No matter what the decision was, she knew that they would face it together.  The three loli volunteers - the dog girl, elf loli, and human girl - started passing out voting cards to everyone present in the mall. They moved quickly and efficiently through the crowd, ensuring that each person received one card. The cat-eared leader watched over them carefully, keeping an eye out for any disputes or arguments that might break out as the voting got underway.<br />
<br />
The instructions were simple - write a capital &#39;S&#39; for &quot;Stay&quot; or a capital &#39;G&#39; for &quot;Go&quot; on the card, then fold it in half and hand it back. It was a rudimentary system, but under the circumstances, it was the best they could manage.<br />
<br />
Sarah took her voting card from one of the volunteers, her brow furrowed as she tried to decide which way to vote. Amy looked at her own card, turning it over in her small hands as she thought about what choice was best for them.</p>
