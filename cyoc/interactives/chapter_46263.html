<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting home form the mall, Gene headed to the bathroom to take a shower and get ready for his evening with Melissa. Stopping in his room along the way, he took off his bracelet, necklace and earrings and put them in a little jewlery box on his dresser. As he was putting the box back he noticed that several of the dresser drawers were partially open and his closet door was open as well.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he walked across the room and opened the closet the rest of the way. As he expected, the closet was in disarray, his blouses all out of order and several of his skirts had actually fallen off their hangers. Folding his slender arms under his ample breasts he took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny! How many times have I told you to quit borrowing my stuff without asking?&quot; his voice was high, just liek a girl would sound.<br />
<br />
Moments later Jenny, his little sister by three years came into his room, wearing one of his favorite blouses, the sky blue one that really brought out the highlights in his long blond hair. She was frowning, and looking quite upset that her brother had caught her taking his clothing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know,&quot; she pouted, &quot;But you said you were going to take me to the mall with you today so we could go shoe shopping together, then you went and left without me because I still had chores to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was just like her to try and shift the blame, but Gene found that he could not be upset with her. They had been inseparable for as long as he could remember, going shopping together, having long gossip sessions and swapping fashion advice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; he sighed, putting his hands on his shapely hips, &quot;I'm sorry. If it makes you feel better I didn't even go shoe shopping. I just bought a new bra and came right back here. I mean I didn't have much time to goof off on account of how I'm going to hang out with Melissa tonight and it's going to take me some time to get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; then she looked at him hopefully, &quot;But can I still borrow your blouse? I'm hanging out with my friends tonight too and you know how they all look up to you because of how much you know about fashion. They all wish that their brothers were more like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gene found himself unable to refuse the request when it was framed as such a compliment. He did pride himself in his fashion sense and knowing how to dress to draw attention to his assets, &quot;Okay, just clean up what you knocked down in my closet so I can get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jenny smiled and started picking up the clothing she had knocked down in his closet.<br />
<br />
Glad that matter was taken care of, Gene went to the bathroom and got undressed. First he removed his shirt and bra, gently caressing one of his big, dark nipples with a pink painted nail, watching as the nub of flesh perked up at the attention. Between his breasts, a very impressive c-cup, but still round and perky, and his waist length blond hair, he knew he had a body to die for, to say nothing of his wide hips, cute little butt and long, slender, legs. Most girls he knew of wished that they had a body as good looking as his, and he had never met another guy who looked even half as sexy as he did.<br />
<br />
Running his hands over the smooth skin of his chest and arms, he then removed his pants, so that he was standing there in nothing but his panties, a provocative shade of red, the bulge of his manhood pressing against the soft fabric.<br />
<br />
He looked his legs over and was glad to see that he would not have to shave them, for he doubted that he would have enough time to do it properly.<br />
<br />
Turning around in front of the mirror he examined himself from all angles. Aside from the bulge in his panties, he looked just like a model.<br />
<br />
Then he removed his panties, looking down at his member, nestled as it was in his downy golden pubic hair, just under an inch long at the moment, with balls to match which were barely visible beneath his pubic hair.<br />
<br />
With a wicked smile, he caressed it between his thumb and first finger, watching as it rose to the occasion, growing until it was almost as big as his thumb. Turning on the water with his free hand he stepped into the shower.<br />
<br />
Most guys he knew seemed to have the misguided belief that bigger was better, but then again, every other guy he knew was pathetically flat chested and had no fashion sense. Gene was quite pleased with the size of his member, since if it was any bigger he would not have been able to wear panties, and anyway, its size had no effect on how well it worked, as was proved by how it responded to the attention he was giving it right now.<br />
<br />
Massaging his breasts with one hand, he stroked his member with the other, imagining what he would eventually do with Melissa. At the moment their relationship was pretty tame, just hugging and kissing, with the occasional touching and caressing, but soon he was sure that she would take things to the next level. He could wait for the time being, besides, he very much enjoyed teasing her, stroking her between the legs and feeling the way her enormous member strained against the fabric of her pants. She would blush furiously and look away, pretending that she did not know how obvious her desire was. Some day soon though, she would act upon her oh so visible desire, and he imagined how that would be, she would kiss him to the cheek, down his neck and to his breasts, planting especially long kisses on his breasts, teasing his nipples with her tongue, before kissing lower and lower down until she was kissing his member, taking its full erect length into her mouth, rubbing her tongue all over its entire two inches.<br />
<br />
Then he would return the favor, doing the same for her.<br />
<br />
It was with the thought of her enormous member in his mouth that he reached his climax, a small spurt of semen hitting the wall of the shower.<br />
<br />
His rapidly softening manhood slipped through his delicate fingers and he finished his shower.<br />
<br />
Afterwards he dried his hair, carefully styling it so that every strand would fall perfectly into place. Then he wrapped himself in a towel and went to his room.<br />
<br />
In case tonight proved to be the night, he selected his most sexy pair of panties, lacy, red and black, and hardly able to contain his masculine anatomy, as small as it was. The bra he chose was equally provocative.<br />
<br />
Next he chose the shortest miniskirt he had and found the perfect blouse, a bright red one with a plunging neckline that his mother always told him not to wear on account it looked like he could jiggle his way out of it at any moment. He always countered with a comment about how a lot of guys he knew walked around shirtless from time to time so she should be glad that he did not. It was a joke of course, ever since he had hit puberty and his breasts had started growing in he had been unable to imagine walking around without a bra, much less going shirtless.<br />
<br />
For the final touch he put on his favorite pair of earrings, little sapphire studs and a matching necklace, one with a chain long enough that the sapphire hung down to rest against the tops of his breasts.<br />
<br />
All that remained was to put on makeup. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he pulled a mirror forward on high night table and opened a draw to sort through a large selection of lipstick, blush, eyeshadow and anything else he might need. First he put on mascara, batting his eyelashes afterwards and admiring himself in the mirror. From there all that was needed was a touch of eyeshadow, a bit of blush and a nice subtle pink shade of lipstick to bring out the fullness of his lips.<br />
<br />
Pleased with his appearance, he slipped on a pair of high heels and got in his car to drive to Melissa's house.<br />
<br />
When he got there she greeted him at the door, her breasts jiggling under her tight pale yellow shirt. To his expert eye, it was obvious that she was not wearing a bra. Then she threw her arms around him and kissed him, her breasts pressing against his, and lower down he could feel her member pressing against his leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was starting to worry you wouldn't show up,&quot; she giggled.<br />
<br />
Her giggling was contagious and he found himself laughing as well. He tossed his head back, making his long hair shimmer and ripple, &quot;Sorry, but you know how I am, I've just got to look perfect to spend the night with a perfect girl. So what do you have in mind for the evening?&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled widely, fluttering his eyelashes at her as he waited to see what she had in mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing big,&quot; her eyes fluttered down ward for a moment, and Gene followed her gaze to stare at the bulge of her member through her pants, &quot;I was just thinking that a night of watching movies, snuggling and talking would be nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gene was fine with that, and wrapping an arm around her, he followed her into the living room where he sat down on the sofa next to her.<br />
<br />
She put on the movie she had rented, 'Titanic' which he must have watched with her at least three times, but it was her favorite movie so he was willing to endure it yet again, especially since she would be pressed up against him for the duration of the movie, snuggling with him.<br />
<br />
As the movie started, she rested her head against his shoulder and sighed, &quot;Gene, I've been thinking lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; he rested his hand on her thigh, pleased that she did not try to make him move it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she paused for a moment, then continued, &quot;I'm so lucky to have you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm lucky to have you,&quot; he countered, and feeling bold, shifted here he rested his hand so that it was just touching the bulge of her member, then taking a chance, he began to gently rub his hand back and forth, stroking her member through the fabric of her jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; she closed her eyes in bliss, starting to squirm with pleasure, &quot;Do you have any idea how good that feels?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she slid her hand up under his skirt to stroke his manhood through his panties.<br />
<br />
He giggled, a high girlish sound, &quot;I think I might.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was bucking her hips now, the hardness of her member straining against the fabric of her pants and she grabbed his hand and pressed it harder against her, &quot;Then you know if you keep it up I'll cum in my pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then take them off,&quot; he suggested, his voice a sultry purr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; she gasped, &quot;No, no, my mom would kill me if she found out. She thinks it's not...ahh...that's so good!&quot;<br />
<br />
After several deep breaths she tired to push his hand away, her face flushed, &quot;Mom thinks it's not...ooh...ladylike.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; he lifted his hand away, still smiling, &quot;I wouldn't want you to do anything that isn't lady like. I hope this is something lady like.&quot;<br />
<br />
He punctuated his statement with a kiss on her lips, which she returned with great enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
When at last they broke the kiss, she nodded, &quot;Yeah, that's lady like, not as fun, but still good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gene gave her a tight hug, his breasts pressing against her and she snuggled into the warm softness of his embrace, &quot;I'll do what I can, but that doesn't mean that we can't make plans. Two more years and we'll both be out of college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm,&quot; she nodded, &quot;You're so good. I don't think any other guy I know would be willing to wait. So understanding, sometimes it's like you know what it's like to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling, he kissed her on the forehead, &quot;Hey, we've been friends forever practically. I mean back in grade school we would do each other's hair, play house together and all that. All the times we went shopping together, talked about fashion and everything else. You know I'd never do something you weren't ready for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered, &quot;My mom still can't believe that we're actually dating. I think that's part of the problem, for the longest time I think she was terrified that I might be interested in girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gene giggled at the thought, &quot;Moms can be so clueless sometimes. Your mom thought that just because of what you have between your legs you wouldn't act like a girl? My mom can be just as bad though, she worried that when I hit puberty I wouldn't want to wear a bra, just because I'm a guy. It's like she never noticed how much I cared about how I looked and how much I liked to wear outfits that looked good on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was Melissa's turn to giggle, &quot;Yeah, moms can be so clueless.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was how they spent the night, snuggling together and enjoying each others company.</p>
