<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After giving it some thought, Jeff decides to transform himself into his 14-year-old sister Larisa Davis. Larisa is 5’3’’ tall, has smooth black hair that reaches just below her should blades which she always styles in a pony tail, she has sea-green eyes, medium B-cup sized breasts and a perfect hourglass figure. Jeff blushes hard when he feels his cock twitch and start to harden as he pictures his sister’s body, ‘man… I should be ashamed of myself, getting aroused when thinking about my sister,’ the 16-year-old thinks to himself, ‘but she does have an amazing figure! It has nothing to do with sexual fantasies, I’m just curious, that does not make me a perv! Besides, she’s not here over the weekend, I have the house to myself for two full days, she’ll never know!’<br />
<br />
Jeff opens his file and starts editing it to match the stats of his sister, since he knows how she looks, he does not need to scan her to transform into her. The only thing he leaves unchanged is his name, when it comes to sexuality, he decides to change it into “lesbian”, ‘just to be on the safe side,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I doubt that nothing will happen in two days, but you never know’. Jeff also sets the Chronivac to automatically adjust all of his clothes, including the clothes in his closet, to adjust to his new gender, and sets the transformation to take an hour, and to last 48 hours.<br />
<br />
After looking over the settings, Jeff nods his head in satisfaction before confirming the inputs, the teen shivers, when he feels a pins-and-needles sensation run through his whole body. Remembering what the manual had said, Jeff jumps to his feet and hurries over to his full-length mirror, wanting to witness himself transforming into his sister.<br />
<br />
At first nothing seems to happen, but then Jeff notices that his hair seems to look a little longer and the structure of his face look much softer, his nose looks a little smaller, his eyes a little bigger, his lips more plumb and his chin smaller and a little pointier.<br />
<br />
Jeff then feels his arms and hands change, looking at them, he notices that his muscles, for which he had worked for so long shrink away, causing his arms to become slender, the hairs on his arms retreat back into his body, leaving behind silky soft skin. The transforming boy’s hands shrink and his fingernails grow a little longer, Jeff feels his legs reshape, taking on a more feminine form.<br />
<br />
The teen’s hair is by now past his shoulder blades, Jeff feel’s his hair style itself into a ponytail, “I’m looking more and more like… wait… my voice… I sound just like my sister,” he says to himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff then feels his cock and balls quiver and start to shrink, he feels his balls retreat back into his body, the boy assuming that they’ll soon be his… HER ovaries. As his boy-parts slowly shrink away, Jeff feels his chest swell and watches in amazement as it puffs out into beautiful medium B-cups, he then feels a bra materialize, holding his breasts secure.<br />
<br />
Jeff reaches up a hand and squeezes one of his tits, letting out a moan, “damn, and I thought girls were overreacting, but… damn… this things sure are sensitive,” he says. The teen then lets out a groan when his tummy gurgles, as a womb forms, pushing his insides out of the way, his butt firms up and becomes a little rounder and bigger as his hips crack and pop as they widen. Jeff then feels himself shrinking and soon, instead of Jeff standing in front of his mirror, Larisa is smiling at her reflection, watching as her clothes take on a more feminine look.<br />
<br />
The transformed teen reaches a hand down, touching his… her… crotch, “man, it feels so weird to have nothing dangling between my legs,” he says, “but, to be honest, I kinda prefer having girl parts than an annoying cock!”<br />
<br />
Jeff takes a while, taking in his new body, smiling at his reflection as he turns around, taking in every angle, “man, Larisa sure is hot,” the “girl” mutters, “no wonder every boy turn their heads, and I am not surprised that Dion, her boyfriend, is obsessed with her”.<br />
<br />
After checking “herself” out, Jeff walks over to his Laptop, sitting down on his chair, “what should I do now,” he asks himself, “I could try something else with the program. Hm… or I could transfer it onto my phone and head out for some… hehe… “fun”. Or I could stay at home and… um… examine MY body… I am NOT a perv, I am just curious. Hmmm… how should I decide?”<br />
<br />
Unaware to Jeff, on the other side of town, Dion Sanchez, Larisa’s boyfriend, with whom she is in a relationship since two years, is sitting in his room, browsing through his phone.<br />
<br />
Dion Sanchez is a 15-year-old boy, he is part French and part Spanish, he moved with his parents from Spain to the US because his father, who is French, found a well paid job as a lawyer, while his spanish mother found a job as an elementary school teacher. The teen has an athletic body, his skin is a nice olive color, he has short brown hair, which he styles in an undercut and brown eyes.<br />
<br />
‘I wish I knew why Larisa doesn’t want to take our relationship a step further,’ the 15-year-old thinks to himself, ‘we’ve been in a relationship since two years, I think that is long enough and time to have sex. However… every time I bring the subject up, Larisa somehow gets mad for some reason and says stuff like “I’m not ready”, or “we are to young”, or “it’s far to early to be thinking about THAT!”. I disagree, I think for one, we are both old enough to have sex, second, I think a two year relationship is long enough, why wait longer if the relationship is working so great?’<br />
<br />
The boy sighs, “there must be another reason,” he mumbles to himself, “I wish I knew what that reason is, but she just does not want to tell me. She always says that there isn’t any other reason than that she is not ready to go that far”.<br />
<br />
As Dion browses the App-store on his phone, his eyes catch a strange looking App, titled “The Chronivac”, the logo is a large “C” in front of a blue background. Something about the App causes Dion to get curious and he decides to read the description, he raises his eye brow, “yeah… right,” he says, “as IF there is an App out there that is able to transform anyone and anything into anything imaginable, alter the reality and even display a scanned person’s information and darkest secrets”.<br />
<br />
The boy moves his thumb to the “x” to close the window, but then hesitates, “what if it’s true though,” he asks himself, “this could be my way of finally finding out the real reason why Larisa does not want to go further in our relationship”.<br />
<br />
Dion thinks for a while, he then shrugs, “what the hell,” he says, “it won’t help to give it a try,” so he downloads and installs the App.<br />
<br />
After the installation is complete, Dion opens the App, “now to see if this really works,” he mutters, deciding to scan himself. Dion opens his file, after scanning himself, and his eyes widen in shock, “okay… yeah… no way,” he mutters, when he sees his stats and his darkest secrets, he never even shared with his best friend, listed.<br />
<br />
Dion shakes his head, and after calming down decides to do a small test by changing his eye color from brown to blue. The teen stares in disbelief at his reflection in his mirror as he watches his eyes change color, then a grin forms on his face, “amazing! Hehe… with this App, our relationship will become so much more interesting, and I already have a few sweet ideas. First though, I’d better head to Larisa’s and scan her, I have to know the real reason why she doesn’t want sex,” with that, and after changing his eye color back to brown, heads out the house and is soon sitting on the bus on his way to his girlfriend’s house, ‘I just hope she’s home,’ he thinks to himself.</p>
