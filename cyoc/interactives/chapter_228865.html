You gather up your courage and stroll out of the changing room, naked as the day you were born. You try to ignore the stares of the other people in the shop as you look for the clerk. You finally spot her and make your way over. You can&#39;t help but notice how different this body moves, the gentle sway of your hips and the strange jiggling in new areas, but most of all, you feel so much more graceful in your movement. You finally reach the clerk, clear your throat, and in your new sweet feminine voice say, &quot;uh, excuse me...&quot;You feel like you are trapped between a rock and a hard place.

Are you okay with wearing the dress?&quot; The clerk&#39;s eyes widen slightly at your words, and she takes a step back from you. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know how that happened,&quot; she says, trying to keep her voice steady. &quot;But I can help you with changing back. Are you okay with wearing the dress?&quot; &quot;No,&quot;you say sharply,&quot;I don&#39;t want to wear a dress or and girls&#39; clothes!

With magic like this, it&#39;s hard to reverse.&quot; &quot;How can you sell costumes that transform people and have no way to reverse it?&quot; You ask. &quot;There is a way, but it takes time,&quot;she says calmly,&quot;you are our first accidental transformation.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s possible,&quot;she says sadly,&quot;but it will take time...at least a month to get all the ingredients and spell work done.&quot; &quot;You mean I am stuck like this for a month?&quot;you squeak in exasperation. &quot;At least,&quot;she says nodding,&quot;maybe longer.

It&#39;s a risk you took when you picked it up, and you&#39;ll have to deal with the consequences. I will start getting the reversal spell ready, in the meantime, you could try living as a woman.

 You take the sheet from the clerk and wrap it around yourself, feeling grateful for her kindness. As you step out of the shop, you feel a strange sensation as the cool air hits your skin. You look down at your body and wonder what you are going to do next.<br />
