<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>(A/N: I love working with you, JLTF. I kind of wish we could coordinate more)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zeke continued to the next class soon after lunch upon seeing Nate return - looking a bit more sweltering. His shirt was pulled tight over his body, his nipples starting to be visible through his shirt. Zeke thought it might be worth a try to pinch one of em the next time the guys saw one another. The result might be something. As Zeke finished up his lunch, the period at an end, he watched the guys heading off to their next classes, dealing with the oddities in their clothes. Brad was distinctly more handsome now than he was at the start, though in a very obviously model / pretty boy like way. He still seemed very cocky, eager to go, but he was dealing with how tight his clothes were on him. Zeke wondered if Brad might be finding himself drawing a certain kind of interest.<br />
<br />
Next Zeke regarded Danny and he put his hands behind his neck and took a sharp intake of breath as he watched Danny get up and start heading off - another year of steroid amplification added to his body. Zeke swore he could see every striation in Danny&#39;s back through the tight as fuck tank top he was wearing. And if anything it only got more noticeable when he started walking. He tried to pull at his collar to get some breathing room, but evidently that wasn&#39;t working so well.<br />
<br />
Then there was poor Nate.<br />
<br />
Nate was trying to look dead ahead, focusing entirely on getting through with his school work. He was rocking a visible half-hard erection in his shorts, and due to the amount of muscle he put on so far it was making it far easier for Nate to see or be seen as lewd. The way his shirt clung to his body, the way his thighs and quads crowded his pants and made his manhood push out a bit more, it was all very easily noticed. And Zeke could tell that, most likely, Nate would not be having it very easy the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
Zeke felt a sense of excitement as he walked, there were about three or four hours left in school. Three or four hours of changes for Danny and Brad, and Nate...well, there was always more time in the day for him to be tempted into another episode like that. It had been fucking wild to see Nate buck his hips like that in company. Zeke remembered looking at Brad and seeing him trying to make it seem he was not reacting at all - but biting his lower lip and looking distinctly interested.<br />
<br />
Which itself was a subject Zeke felt a keen interest in.<br />
<br />
Nate had his libido vastly dialed up, and while Brad was by and large a guy who preferred women, he WAS still bisexual regardless what he told himself. Zeke decided against pushing the two toward each other with the Chronivac - it&#39;d be more fun to see if anything happened between them at any point. <br />
<br />
As Zeke moved, he looked over at Chris, obviously trying to live like everything was normal. However he seemed affected by something. He was walking slowly, and a dreamy smile was over his face. &quot;Lisa thinks I&#39;m built...&quot; He murmured to himself, and polished his bicep with one hand. Sure he wasn&#39;t the biggest guy at school, but having Lisa Turnette express interest in him like that...well! It was honestly quite thrilling. And thrilling indeed.<br />
<br />
Zeke could see the beginnings of an aroused presence in Chris&#39; jeans. Tight as they were now, they left little to the imagination.<br />
<br />
He decided, if Chris was getting some booty later due to the transformation he already underwent, he figured he could give Chris more of a leg up still. Pulling out the Chronivac and scanning Chris, he promptly went ahead and added another forty pounds of muscle to Chris&#39; body.<br />
<br />
Zeke stepped back, pocketed the device so nobody might connect the dots, and watched;<br />
<br />
Chris once again gulped and clasped his hand over his groin, feeling his manhood go rock hard. He whined, &quot;Why...again? Feels so good, but...why again? M-My clothes! Cmon, this&#39;ll rip my clothes!&quot; Chris&#39; whining did not affect the speed at which the muscle piled on to his body. His ass grew tighter, stronger, and larger, developing into a powerful bubble butt that filled out his jeans. Zeke swore he could see every dimple on that ass. Chris moaned as his pecs pressed out, tearing at the front of his shirt, damaging the polo buttons. He gasped as his growing, larger arms and boulder shoulders challenged the space available in the polo, a few sections tearing in the underarm. Chris swore it felt like he was just dripping with testosterone.<br />
<br />
Or just dripping with sweat by the time he felt his back swell out, his lats making him gulp as he felt them stress the back of his shirt. He groaned as his abs defined further, all six of them and solid obliques standing out in stark relief. He could almost see them through his shirt just as well as his powerfully built chest. By the time it was done, Chris wiped his forehead and groaned, &quot;I hope I&#39;m done...this could ruin my clothes! I-I think I need new ones...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Chris headed off. Zeke did remember he had a class later with him. Would be good to check in and see how Chris was handling himself. Heh, handling.<br />
<br />
So, the next class, Human Biology. Zeke was taking it due to the health and wellness direction he was going, and though he did intend to go into some field related to that to help finance his bodybuilding, he noted he was probably the only one. Of the guys in the class... Clyde was a very shy young nerdy guy with very bushy blond hair, constantly wore billowing clothes to hide his body, which trended toward skinny-fat, and usually sat at the back. Brendan, a rather chubby, tall and bright fellow who nursed a crush on the beautiful Veronica that sat near the front, penning poems to himself about the auburn haired beauty. David sat near the back near Clyde, a confident leadership sort, but skinny and rather professional. He was of Syrian descent apparently, a ways back - his black hair, brown eyes and deep olive skin color combined with a leaner sort of look that apparently drew in Veronica.<br />
<br />
And who could forget the instructor himself? Dr. Cory Fletcher was a now quite old fellow that had some trappings of high school glory concealed in ages past. He was rather chubby, wore a professional looking coat, button up shirt, dress pants and boots to class, giving every indication of a formerly quite healthy man left to end up like this. Zeke already knew what he had to do when he saw a photo on the doc&#39;s desk depicting him in a much more strapping state. He apparently used to have wavy, light brown near blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a powerfully muscled body.<br />
<br />
Even as the teacher started the lesson, Zeke got an idea from the topic. Today&#39;s lesson would be the finer aspects of puberty and the musculo-skeletal ramifications and protein differences that occurred throughout it from start to finish in boys. Grinning, Zeke first loaded up the doc&#39;s profile. It said he was 63 years old, which tracked with his aged appearance. Apparently he used to be much more muscular before a cliffjumping accident, and indeed he was downright amazing looking even in his forties. He went ahead and decided to set up a change - every time Cory said &quot;puberty&quot; he would grow 3 years younger.<br />
<br />
Next...<br />
<br />
Zeke set up a change wherein Clyde would grow 100 lbs of muscle over the course of the hour. The bushy haired nerd, at about 120 lbs, would end up a hulking 220 lbs brawny athlete by the end. He decided against any mental changes. Figuring he could let Clyde figure out how he wanted to handle this.<br />
<br />
Poor, hopeless Brendan... Zeke knew when he wasn&#39;t taking notes or doing classwork, Brendan would be penning his poetry. So he set up a change wherein Brendan would lose 10 lbs of fat and gain 15 lbs of muscle for each line of poetry he finished, until the fat across Brendan&#39;s body was gone, at which point the transformation would shift to just muscling him up by 5 lbs for each line.<br />
<br />
And David... David, Zeke decided to go with adding 10 lbs of muscle to David every time he answered a question posed to the class. Seeing as David was a leadership guy, a real take charge type that liked giving the answer whenever he had it...that&#39;d have some interesting effects. Zeke wondered if Veronica&#39;s guy choice would change by the end of the class... well, whatever happened, Zeke figured at least class wouldn&#39;t be boring!</p>
