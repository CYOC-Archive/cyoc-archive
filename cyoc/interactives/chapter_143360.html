<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now I was never gay but I thought I might go out to a bar in my new body and see what sort of reaction I get.<br />
<br />
I found what I thought looked like a nice bar and saw a couple of men going in. The rainbow neon was sure that I was in the right place.<br />
<br />
As I went in I took a look around and almost backed out but there was a big man behind me. Dark as the ace of spades and a full foot taller than me and damn did he have muscles. And I thought I was big.<br />
<br />
His mere presence pushed me into the bar. <br />
<br />
I made a b-line to the bar and ordered a beer.<br />
<br />
Was that what I should order here as I looked around and saw that many others were drinking beers.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before a big hairy man with a full beard came up to me and asked me to dance. I politely declined. I don&#39;t think I was really ready to make that move. <br />
<br />
Then a heavy set bear of a man came up and asked to buy me a drink. I thought that was ok. He sat down next to me and we talked. I found out he was a banker and I was wondering if I had seen him at my local bank since he worked for that branch. I didn&#39;t remember seeing him.<br />
<br />
I excused myself and went walking around the bar and headed to the bathroom. This place was nasty.<br />
<br />
As I came out I started to walk around the bar and found a nice dark corner. Hoping that I could watch the action and not be seen. I stood there for several hours heading to the bathroom from time to time to relieve myself returning to that corner. This time after several minutes and the tenth beer or so I realized I wasn&#39;t alone.<br />
<br />
I looked around and didn&#39;t see anyone but I could feel a heavy breathing near me so I settled down and kept watching. Moments later an arm went behind me and pulled me close. I found I couldn&#39;t escape the grasp of this guy.  I was still unable to make out the form of the man that had me in his grasp and I heard a nice gruff voice say lets go to your place.<br />
<br />
Now I don&#39;t know what made me do it, I was shaking like a leaf not having ever done something like this before, but I said ok.<br />
<br />
As we went out the door and into the streetlights I realized it was the big black man that had moved me in when I came in.<br />
<br />
Within minutes we were back at my place and he grabbed me like a rag doll and pulled me up to his big luscious lips and planted a kiss on me with a thick tongue like I had never been kissed before.<br />
<br />
I could feel his right arm around my back end and he was loosening up my belt and dropping my pants to the floor. I was becoming naked from the waist down. As he put me down he pulled my shirt over my head and I was standing there naked.<br />
<br />
Nice body boy. The man said to me.<br />
<br />
I hemmed and hawwed and thanked him for the compliment.<br />
<br />
He tossed his vest and then his black shirt to the sofa and then dropped his pants to the floor. He had not been wearing underwear and the biggest dick I had ever seen dropped soft nearly to his knees.<br />
<br />
My eyes must have bugged out because a thick chortle escaped his lips and he came up close to me. Where&#39;s your bedroom.<br />
<br />
Shaking in his embrace my eyes glanced at my bedroom door and he took me to the door and opened it. There was my bed and with a few steps had me on the bed. My ass on the edge of the bed he lifted my legs to my shoulders and with one great thrust he pushed his cock deep inside of me. I screamed loud that it was wonderful that I wasn&#39;t too near the neighbors. As he thrust in and out deeper and deeper it felt like my insides were altering to accommodate his massive girth. It was the longest round of sex I had ever experienced. It took more than an hour and a half before a deep groan escaped his lips and I could feel my guts filled with his sperm.<br />
<br />
Half a dozen more sessions that night we were exhausted and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
In the morning I woke before he did, still snoring loudly taking up more than half my bed and I went out looking for the device.<br />
<br />
It was in my back pocket at the bar and I had to go get it and see what sort of changes I could do this morning before he woke up.<br />
<br />
I found my pants and checked all the pockets and it wasn&#39;t there. I checked the floor and it hadn&#39;t fallen when he took my pants off. I was in panic mode thinking maybe it was at the bar and my profile was in the memory.<br />
<br />
As I looked around I looked up and that big black man was standing in the door with the device in his hand. Looking for this? He asked.<br />
<br />
Uh yea it&#39;s just a calculator. Can I have it?<br />
<br />
Just a calculator huh? Then how is it when I do this your picture pops up?<br />
<br />
Uh<br />
<br />
And how come when I do this you become internally a female able to bear children?<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
And how is it that when I do this <br />
<br />
I was terrified what he might do next and rushed toward him trying to grab it from him. He was too big.<br />
<br />
You know last night I found this in your back pocket when we went into the bar. I checked it out while you talked to all those men and got fairly proficient by the time we left.<br />
<br />
I made you able to carry children inside here. I come from a large family and they were disappointed when they thought I wouldn&#39;t have any babies but I just found a way where I can have a man and still have children. <br />
<br />
You must have felt the changes last night as I fucked the shit out of you but you have to now know that you are pregnant and are going to have the first of our family.<br />
<br />
But I don&#39;t have a vagina! How the hell is it going to get out.<br />
<br />
A devious grin came across his face and he simply said out of your mangina.<br />
<br />
What the hell is that I asked then I realized what he was talking about.<br />
<br />
Yep.<br />
<br />
Please stop this give me back the machine.<br />
<br />
Not a chance. I am going to be making a lot of money with this offering it&#39;s services to men that want to their perfect partner. And the rest of the time it is going to be locked up. He grabbed me around the waist with his arm grasping the machine behind my back and rubbed my washboard abs and said say goodbye to these because they are going to start rounding out soon.</p>
