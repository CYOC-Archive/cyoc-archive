<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
After dinner, Martha and William found themselves alone in the kitchen. They each had an armful of dishes, <br />
<br />
“I guess I went a little overboard this year.” Martha blushed, her eyes drifting over to the mounds of food left over.<br />
<br />
“Well, at least we won’t go hungry. We’ll be eating turkey sandwiches until Nate goes off to college.” William laughed. <br />
<br />
“Speaking of which, do you think we’re going the right thing in regards to Kenya?” Martha lowered her voice so the others wouldn’t hear them. <br />
<br />
“Well, I think she’s a smart girl, and she obviously has an eye for Nate. And Nate clearly feels the same way. I don’t think he ever took his eyes off her during dinner.” William said. <br />
<br />
“Which is nice, considering he’s never shown much interest in any girl for more than a few days.”<br />
<br />
“To be fair, they never showed much interest in him either. I just hope the age gape doesn’t prove to be a hurtle.”<br />
<br />
“I thought you didn’t mind that? Your folks aren’t the same age, neither are mine for that matter.” Martha pointed out. William’s parents themselves were fifteen years apart, and her own has an eight year age difference. <br />
<br />
“But both our parents met as adults. Note’s in high school. I have to wonder how Nate and Kenya are going to overcome that obstacle.” said William. <br />
<br />
“From what she’s told us, I’d hazard a guess to say she actually has very little in common with Nate. Other than the mutual attraction, she’s almost thirty and far more worldly and mature than Nate. And he still thinks it’s funny to put whoopee cushions on chairs.” he said. <br />
<br />
“Mmm, I see your point. What I can’t wrap my head around is how Kenya didn’t realize Nate was in high school. Even if they met while Nate was in his were form, it’s fairly obvious he’s still aa teenager.” Martha said, knowing Nate wasn’t as developed as adult werewolves like Evan Lawson were. Though comparing him to Evan wasn’t fair since Evan was a Navy SEAL, in addition to having a were body.<br />
<br />
“What he must have done or said to make her think otherwise, I’d like it if he behaved like that all the time.” Martha continued, and then sighed wistfully. <br />
<br />
“Still, I hope things work out between them. If not for the long term, then the short. Nate’s always been a bit flighty. And I imagine there are far more compatible bachelors for Kenya to choose from.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think this is more serious than they’ve lead us to believe?” Martha asked. <br />
<br />
“I honestly couldn’t say. Though based on the talk I had with Nate last week, they’re still working on a few things.” William recalled the discussion with Nate he’d had about him and Kenya needing to be on the same page for their relationship to work. Which is why William requested the two take things “slow” for the time being. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“So, Eric, Nate tells me you’re seeing a fairly interesting young lady as well.” Kenya said. <br />
<br />
Eric nodded vigorously, surprised Nate had even mentioned his relationship with Spencer to Kenya. Then again, with everything that happened this past week, it would have odd if he didn’t. <br />
<br />
“You must really care about her. Nate told me how you went tearing off after her with a baseball bat.” Kenya commended Eric on his bravery, which made the younger Anderson blush. <br />
<br />
“Thank you.” Eric said. His parents rejoined the group, carrying a large pot of coffee. <br />
<br />
“Nate said her mother was a panthress, maybe I’ve encountered her before. We might even be in the same pride.” Kenya said as Martha and William seated themselves again. They sat beside Eric, who sat next to Francis. On the other side of the table was Samantha, Nate, and then Kenya. <br />
<br />
“You think?” Nate asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh sure. Moon Lake is a small community. Chances are I’ve met one of them before without realizing it.” Kenya said. She’d lived in or around Moon Lake her entire life, and was very familiar with the exotic werecat population. Though not the domestic werecats like Francis and Samantha. <br />
<br />
“Their last name is Lawson. But before Maggie was married her name was Carson. She also has a sister, Elle Danvers.” Samantha chimed in. Kenya ran through her memories until she confirmed her suspicions. <br />
<br />
“I know Elle. She and my aunt have worked together, and my aunt joined her pride about a year ago.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” Almost everyone said at the same time. <br />
<br />
“Elle’s studying to be a microbiologist, correct? Anyway, my aunt is a botanist, and was having trouble with some sort of plant virus. She knew Elle through pride friends, and asked her for help.” explained Kenya. <br />
<br />
“It really is a small world.” Martha commented. <br />
<br />
“And how. You know, now that I think about it, I believe I’ve met your aunt before. Tatianna Dayo?” Francis said. <br />
<br />
“Yes. How did you meet?” <br />
<br />
“We go to the garden where she works all the time. It’s where Samantha proposed to me.” Francis smiled at her wife. <br />
<br />
“And almost lost the ring. I was so nervous I dropped it into a koi pond.” Samantha laughed, everyone joining her. A sharp ringing sound Martha’s cell phone interrupted. Martha excused herself, and saw there was a text from Maggie. <br />
<br />
“The Lawsons want to know what would be a good time to come over. They’re almost finished at Elle’s place.” Martha told everyone. <br />
<br />
“Whenever’s convenient. The sun’s still up, will that be a problem for them, what with Spencer stuck in her were form.” William said. <br />
<br />
“Stuck in her were form?” Kenya looked at Nate for an explanation. <br />
<br />
“She broke her arm. So she’s staying in her were form to speed up the healing process.” he said. Kenya made one of those “Ah” sounds in response. <br />
<br />
She herself have never had injuries so severe that she had to remained transformed. Truth be told she was even more jealous of this girl. Not only was she a hybrid, she had an excuse to remain in her more TRUE form. Which must be something, as hybrids were special no matter what form they were in.<br />
<br />
“I love Nate, but I wonder if he’d be willing to share me with Spencer for a night. Or if she’d be willing to let me explore her?” Kenya thought. She wouldn’t exactly classify herself as bi, but she wasn’t opposed to a little girl on girl action.</p>
