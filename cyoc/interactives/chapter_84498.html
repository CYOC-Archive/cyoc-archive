<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;What&#39;s going on?&#39; James saw himself change in the mirror on the ceiling. His skin became lite pink and white formed in circles around his eyes and in an oval around his mouth, his hair turned bright red. All of it scared the shit out of him.<br />
His girlfriend had broken up with him and he finally decided to explore the feelings he had denied most of his life. He and his friend had sucked each other off when they were twelve but then girls became more interesting for him so James followed suit. He dated girls because it was expected but it was never satisfying and none of his relationships had lasted long. The one night he decided to try new things he had to walk into a clown bar and this happened. <br />
The image of himself in the mirror stays in his mind &#39;I am really turning into a clown&#39; James thinks in disbelief<br />
&#39;I thought he was joking&#39; as he thinks back, remembering the feeling and the hunger for the clown&#39;s dick &#39;I need to stop this or wake up, I don&#39;t want to be a clown or gay anymore&#39;<br />
He got out of there as fast as he could and is now just running trying to get away to somewhere to do something. The sight of a naked clown dashing do the street brings laughter from people thinking it is just a clown streaking to be funny. The sound of the laughter sends thrills through James almost as good as his orgasms when he masturbates. His lungs finally give out and he diverts into an alley to catch his breath. James peaks around the corner and finds no pursuit.<br />
&#39;Where am I?&#39; James questions himself looking around trying to get his bearings<br />
A noise from behind him makes him literally jump two feet in the air. James swings around and sees a man with his back to him digging through the trash getting cans.<br />
&quot;Hey can you help me&quot; James queries the man<br />
The man turns around and again James is scared shitless, he stumbles back in fear. The man is actually a old hobo clown, he has a small black nose,his dark hair has streaks of grey, painted on dark gray beard with small areas of white around his eyes and mouth and smoking a cigar. As he turns he blows out a large pink cloud of smoke and James panting hard from the run inhales a large amount of it. The sweet smell and taste of bubblegum fills James senses and makes him lightheaded, the tingling increasing through his body.<br />
&quot;What do we have here? I most certainly can help you, bud&quot; confirms the hobo<br />
James stumbles back with a blissful look on his face and inhales again trying to get more of the smoke.<br />
&quot;Looks like you want another hit&quot; the hobo inhales deeply on the cigar and then pulls James in for a long kiss blowing the smoke into James&#39;s lungs. The hobo breaks the kiss and James falls to his knees, eyes completely unfocused, and starts to giggle uncontrollably.<br />
&quot;Looks like you needed that&quot; nods the hobo<br />
The white around James mouth retreats to just around his mouth, the white around his eyes goes from circles to more squares shaped. James feels the tingles run across his face as he feels his beard grown to a five o&#39;clock shadow. He reaches up to rub his face and find the beard is now painted on. His eyebrows disappear and become thick painted on ones angled downward on top of the white around his eyes.<br />
&quot;Do you want me to help you change into your true self?&quot; asks the hobo<br />
Feeling dizzy from the smoke and hazy from the pleasurable tingles running through his body he answers &quot;YES&quot; all he wants to do is go back to the way he was.<br />
&quot;As you wish, sir&quot; He moves behind James and starts to massage the cheeks of his butt that grow larger under his touch<br />
James moans in response to the massage. A finger finds its way into James butt and James moans more and bends over pushing back on the intruder into virgin territory.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, relax and bend over for Bosco&quot;<br />
Bosco drops his pants and a large long tan dick with a black head springs out. He kneels behind James and guides his dick to his target. James lunges forward in surprise from the intruder but as his ass stretches and accepts the dick entering him he sighs in ecstasy and pushes back eager to get more of it in him. His skin takes on more of a tan color except his face which turns a redder color around the white and brown of his beard, like a person who spends a lot of time in sun and has a sunburn. Bosco starts fucking James in earnest speeding up his rhythm. James starts to moan and pant in sync with Boscos thrusts, pushing back every time he feels Bosco start to pull out. James hair turns from the bright red to a reddish brown mop on his head. His nipples which had turned red change to a brown color and became erect to tiny balls the size of gumdrops. The head of his dick turns from the bright red also to a brown color as his dick shortens and thins. The tingles increase as euphoria washes over him all James&#39;s thoughts turn inward towards the cock in his ass causing him all this pleasure. Bosco grabs his ass and starts to pound him faster and harder. <br />
&quot;Jenzo, I am going to help you be what you really are&quot; whispers Bosco <br />
Spots start to appear before Jenzo&#39;s eyes matching the spots appearing in his memories. Jenzo can feel his orgasm building, staying so close but not going over the edge. Bosco&#39;s movements start to become jerky and he starts to breathe faster, Jenzo knows he is close too and begins to squeeze his ass in time with the thrusts. Bosco finally grunts and thrusts hard into Jenzo, Jenzo can fill his dick pumping his cum into him. Jenzo&#39;s stomach expands and his stomach spills forward to the ground. Jenzo finally goes over the edge as the tingles peak and the spots completely fill his eyes as his mind also blanks. With an audible pop Jenzo&#39;s nose expands to a small black ball and as his vision returns new memories flood into the empty space. Memories of his life as a clown, always the butt of the joke and always the butt to be used by dicks but that is what he was. Bosco withdraws and comes around and presents his dick in front of Jenzo&#39;s face.<br />
&quot;Clean my dick&quot; he commands<br />
&quot;Yes, boss&quot; Jenzo takes the dick in his mouth running his tongue all over it being sure to get it as clean as possible, relishing the taste. A worn gray suit, patched with colorful patches, forms around his body with a red bowtie at the neck. Both of them stand and Jenzo places a black bowler hat on his head.<br />
&quot;Are you happy with what you are?&quot; asks Bosco<br />
&quot;Yes, boss. I am a gay hobo clown bottom. I am here to take cum into my ass and mouth, make people laugh and be the butt of everyone’s jokes. Thank you for helping me it feels so good to be what I truly am.&quot;<br />
Bosco puts his arm around Jenzo and steers him out of the alley. &quot;Come on; let’s see if we can get some spare change for that ass of yours.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, boss&quot; Jenzo replies excitedly<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
You feel sad at the loss of a potential partner. He ran out the door but you could not find him. He showed such promise; you may catch up with him after he becomes what he is. The thought of this excites you as you suck on the dick of the clown in front of you while another is pounding your ass from behind. Luckily another shift of clowns came in after their show and you got to drown your disappointment in a torrent of their cum.</p>
