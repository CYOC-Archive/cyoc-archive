<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stared at the device&#39;s screen, his finger hovering over the virtual family tree. He couldn’t stop thinking about what he would change. His thoughts kept circling back to one person—his father.<br />
<br />
If he was being honest with himself, his dad wasn’t exactly impressive. Short, skinny, with more of a bookish presence than anything resembling physical strength, his father had always worked a cushy office job and seemed entirely uninterested in sports or anything physical. Jeff couldn’t remember a time when his dad had ever pushed him toward athletics. It was always about academics—learn more, study harder, be smart. Jeff appreciated that, but deep down, he couldn’t help but wonder: What would my life be like if my dad were more like Max Scott, his bullies, father?<br />
<br />
Now that was a man. Peter Scott, Max’s father, stood at an imposing 6-foot-7—a wall of muscle and power. He coached the local college football team and was a semi-professional bodybuilder. Everyone in town knew him, admired him, even feared him a little. And Max? Max was a 16-year-old juggernaut, already built like a young athlete in the making. He weighed nearly twice as much as Jeff, every pound of it solid muscle. Jeff couldn’t help but think: If I had a father like Peter Scott, pushing me, with genetics like his, I could be a beast too. Not just another skinny kid.<br />
<br />
His eyes flicked between his family tree and Max’s, conveniently displayed side by side on the screen. Max was an only child, his picture hanging beneath his parents in the tree. In contrast, Jeff’s own tree had more branches, his younger brother Justin, his father’s side, all of it sitting there, so normal, so ordinary.<br />
<br />
What if I swapped our dads? The thought made his pulse quicken. He didn’t want to give up his entire family, after all—his mom was great, and he liked having his brother around. But the idea of having Peter as a father, someone who’d push him physically, train him like he had trained Max... that was too tempting to resist.<br />
<br />
He hesitated for a moment, but the what-ifs buzzed in his mind like an itch he had to scratch. Jeff clicked on his father’s photo and dragged it over to Peter Scott’s place on the tree. A small menu popped up: Swap or Create New Relationship? Jeff’s heart raced as he clicked Swap.<br />
<br />
The changes rippled out immediately. He watched as his family tree morphed, his father’s side dissolving, replaced by Peter’s imposing lineage. Generations of athletes and coaches took the place of academics and office workers. His grandparents changed, great-grandparents too, all the way back. His father’s entire legacy was overwritten in an instant. He wondered for a fleeting moment if he had made a mistake, but quickly shook his head. I can always change it back, he reassured himself.<br />
<br />
He looked at the new family tree, feeling a strange excitement twist in his stomach. His hand hovered over the Complete Change button, nerves making his fingers tingle. But this was what he wanted, right? This could be the start of something better—something bigger.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, he clicked the button.<br />
<br />
The sensation hit Jeff all at once, it was like a wave rippling through his body, reshaping him from the inside out. It was as if every cell in his body was suddenly expanding, growing stronger, tougher, and more defined. He gasped, his breath catching in his throat as he felt his spine begin to lengthen. It was a subtle, stretching feeling at first, but then it became more intense, as if his entire frame was being pulled upward, his bones elongating and widening to accommodate the mass that was rapidly accumulating on his body.<br />
<br />
His legs were the first to change. He could feel the muscles in his calves and thighs swelling, thickening with raw power. His jeans began to tighten around his legs, the seams straining as the muscle grew beneath the fabric. His quads bulged out, firm and solid, the skin stretching over them as they took on the powerful, well-defined shape of a lifelong athlete. His jeans began to tear, unable to contain his growing bulk. His ass expanded as well, becoming larger and firmer, his jeans almost at breaking point before it stopped growing.<br />
<br />
Then, his torso began to shift. His back broadened, the muscles expanding outward like thick ropes being pulled taut beneath his skin. His shoulders widened, rounding out with dense, solid muscle that pushed against the fabric of his shirt, making it feel tight and restrictive. His chest filled out next, his pecs expanding, giving him a barrel-like chest that rose and fell with every deep breath. His ribcage expanded, making his body seem larger, sturdier, more imposing.<br />
<br />
He reached up instinctively to touch his chest, his fingers grazing the hard, sculpted muscle there. His hands looked different too—larger, more calloused, as if they had spent years gripping weights and working hard in the gym. His arms swelled in response, biceps and triceps thickening, each one growing more defined as they flexed under the pressure of the transformation. His forearms bulged out, veins snaking their way down the length of his arms, pumping blood through muscles that were no longer those of a skinny teenager but of someone who had trained for years to perfect their body. <br />
<br />
His tshirt was skin tight against him and he gripped hold of it with his now large hands and in one move movement ripped it off of his body, freeing his bouncing pecs as he did so.<br />
<br />
He could feel his core tightening, the soft, undefined belly he had before disappearing, replaced by a washboard set of abs that flexed with every small movement. His waist narrowed slightly as his obliques took shape, cutting a strong, lean silhouette. His entire frame had become larger, more powerful, his body taking on the shape of someone who lived and breathed physical fitness.<br />
<br />
His neck thickened too, the muscles around his throat growing stronger, giving him a more masculine, intimidating presence. His jawline sharpened, the bones in his face subtly shifting as his cheekbones became more defined, his features more angular, more striking. Even his hair felt different—fuller, healthier, like his entire body had been optimized for peak performance.<br />
<br />
The final change was in his groin, he grinned with excitement as he felt his dick grow, larger and heavier. He pulled down what was left of his jeans and underwear and watched as his cock expanded and stretched out life a fire hose. His balls were expanding aswell, growing in size. All the while he was getting hard as he did so, his cock expanding more until it was at least 9 inches, and so thick his could only just wrap his hand around it. He had got some seriously good genetics here.<br />
<br />
He grabbed hold of his dick with one hand and started stroking as he flexed his other arm experimentally, feeling the massive biceps respond with a satisfying surge of power, Jeff couldn’t help but grin. The transformation hadn’t just made him bigger, it had made him better. He was now, physically, everything he had ever dreamed of being.<br />
<br />
As Jeff stood there, stroking his dick and basking in the glory of his new body, a different sensation began tingling in his head. At first, he didn’t notice it. He was too caught up in the excitement of his size and strength, admiring the power coursing through his limbs. But as the adrenaline began to fade, something felt… off.<br />
<br />
His thoughts weren’t as sharp as they used to be. It was as if a fog had settled over his mind, dulling the clarity he had always prided himself on. Small things felt harder to process, ideas and words that used to come to him so easily now felt sluggish, like they were swimming through thick mud before reaching the surface.<br />
<br />
He tried to think back to some of the more complicated concepts he had studied in school, the intricate theories and problem-solving exercises his father had always pushed him toward. Normally, those thoughts would flow like water, logical and precise, but now… they felt distant. The memories were still there, but accessing them felt harder, like trying to reach for something just out of grasp.<br />
<br />
His brain wasn’t firing the way it used to. His academic focus, the thing his dad had drilled into him for years, felt fuzzy, almost irrelevant. He didn’t care as much about solving complex problems or memorizing facts. In fact, the drive to focus on academics was fading, replaced by something simpler, more primal.<br />
<br />
Who cares about schoolwork? he thought, flexing his massive arms in front of the mirror again, watching the muscles bulge with each small movement. Look at me. I don’t need that crap. This is what matters now. Muscle.<br />
<br />
The thought startled him at first. He had always taken pride in his intelligence, in the way his father had taught him to think critically and study hard. But now, that sense of pride seemed to be shifting. He didn’t want to spend hours hunched over books or cramming for exams anymore. Why spend hours studying when you can spend hours in the gym?<br />
<br />
He found himself craving competition, physical challenges. The thought of pushing his body even further, of training harder, lifting heavier, and becoming the strongest person in any room felt far more appealing than anything academic. It wasn’t just a preference anymore, it was becoming his primary focus. The books on his desk, the homework assignments he had left unfinished, none of that seemed important. What mattered was his strength, his power, and how he could keep building on it.<br />
<br />
His ambition was shifting. The desire to excel in school was being replaced by an insatiable need to prove himself physically. To dominate, to win. He found his thoughts drifting toward sports, toward competition, imagining how unstoppable he could be now with his new body. Football, wrestling, any sport he put his mind to, he’d be the best, no question. That’s where his focus belonged now. Academics? That was for someone else.<br />
<br />
The transformation wasn’t just about his muscles; it was rewriting his identity. Jeff could feel it happening. The sharp edges of his once-active mind dulled, the drive for intellectual success fading away as the primal need for strength and dominance took its place. He still had the memories of being smart, but the importance of those memories seemed to shrink, fading into the background like noise. He had a new purpose now—one that felt raw, instinctive, and far more satisfying.<br />
<br />
He continued to stroke and was almost at climax as he flexed again in the mirror, the thoughts of math problems and history tests seemed laughable. What was the point of all that? He was bigger than that now. His body, his power, that’s what mattered. That’s what would define him.<br />
<br />
With on deep cry of pleasure he let out several strings of cum, and any academic thought was gone from his head. He was a dumb jock now, focused only on getting more swole. He smirked at himself in the mirror as the room around him changed, weights appeared on the floor as posters of athletes and naked women appeared on his wall, dirty clothes and jockstraps littered the floor.<br />
<br />
He looked around and scratched at his large chest and a scattering of chest hair started to grow in. He remembered being a nerd and having a different dad only moments ago, but that all felt like a distant dream, he wondered what else had changed.</p>
