<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jimmy and his girlfriend left he prom as soon as they were able.  Odette was less that pleased at the moment.  In the mirrored wall of the elevator she had inspected her new self.  Radiantly smooth skin with a light healthy tan.  Her hair and makeup was still perfect.  She looked great and felt healthy and well, but that did not change the fact that she was unhappy.<br />
<br />
Her dress did not fit anymore.  She had spent hours in the mall looking for the right dress that would look perfect for this night.  She had sought the advice from all her friends and the nice sales-lady at the store.  Everyone had said she looked perfect in the dress and it fit her so well that there was no tailoring needed.  Then Loki goes and does this to her.<br />
<br />
First her breast grow and stretch out the neck line.  Fine they look nice but Odette never wanted to have big breasts.  She liked her slim look before and now she seemed disproportionate with these huge balls sitting on her chest.  Slim was nice, she thought, now I am top-heavy.  With a small waist, she added mentally.  She was both fearful and anxious to see what her mid section looked like now.  Poking about through her dress told her only that everything was tighter and smaller in the middle.  But like how a tiny stone cand feel like a rock in your shoe she still did not have a good idea of how bad the reality could be.  She feared the worst.<br />
<br />
Her dress slipped to one side and started sliding over her hip.  She caught it before the whole thing fell completely to the floor.  She cursed herself for going with the strapless dress.  It had not been fun trying to remain decent after Loki moved on to others.  Her tiny waist and stiff stature, coupled with the awkwardness of having new boobs, ensured Odette was constantly policing her dress.  Her perfect dress, which she had bought specifically for Jimmy, was now ripped and ill fitting.  It did not help that Jimmy seemed too eager to see inside her dress and could not keep his hands off her.  It helped her mood even less that he did not seem to notice her pulling away.<br />
<br />
The elevator arrived at the floor dropping Odette and Jimmy out into the hall.  Odette and her friends had rented a room in the hotel in which they could get ready before the prom.  She wanted her friends to be in the room so that Jimmy would not feel like staying too long.  Removing the key-card from her hand bag while trying to hold her dress in place was not easy and she dropped the card.  Jimmy the Chivalrous was to busy holding her waist from behind and kissing her neck to notice.  Odette elbowed him in the stomach to back off then went for the card.<br />
<br />
Bending forward was not possible.  The invisible corset that bound her ensured a straight back.  Fighting the magical restraint Odette was only able to crane her head forward un-flatteringly and to pivot at the hips in a manner that made keel forward out of balance.  Abandoning this movement before she fell, Odette fought her normal movements and started squatting.  Knees bent, legs together, she found herself closer to the floor but with an obstructed view.  Her new cantaloupes, propped up and squeezed in, were right between her eyes and where she needed to look.  A slight twist and another neck crane kept her from having to go to all fours to find the wayward key.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could at least help,&quot; she said as she righted herself and opened the door.  &quot;This is all your fault.  You know that, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful, O,&quot; Jimmy said unhelpfully.  &quot;Besides, I didn't have a choice.  You saw what Loki could do.  If I pissed him off things could have been worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But corsets, Jimmy?  I knew you liked skinny chicks, but I didn't know you were into weird clothes.&quot;  Odette was disappointed to find the room empty of her friends.  She didn't want Jimmy here right now, but then she also did not want to be alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  It's not that weird.  Besides it's not the corset that I like.  It's the way that your body kind of goes in like that and then out again.&quot;  He made a motion with is hands to outline an exaggerated female form.  &quot;Blame it on those cartoons I watch.  Or Coke bottles.  Hell, I don't know why I like it so much I just do.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a moment Odette understood a little about the male mind and how it must be difficult to be so turned on by things like that.  Then she huffed a breath in the tight magical grip and her dress started to slide again.  It was not the change in her body that she was angry at, it was the fact that her boyfriend was focused on her new body and not her hurt feelings.  She was scared and angry and he did not care.<br />
<br />
Odette grabbed some new clothes out of her suitcase and stomped off to the bathroom.  &quot;I'm getting into something else.  My dress doesn't seem to fit right anymore,&quot; she said venomously.  She slammed the door shut.<br />
<br />
With nothing better to do than wait, Jimmy sat on the bed.</p>
