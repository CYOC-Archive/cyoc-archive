<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Commissioned by Kisao</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon was sitting at the computer chair, completely in shock.<br />
<br />
When he’d age Bryan down to a youthful 23, for some reason, the Chronivac had decided to regress Jay all the way down to perhaps a year old. Worse, it seemed to have actually impacted his mental state. Now he was crying uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
“What do I do?” Bryan asked, rushing over to Jay<br />
<br />
“Just rock him or something. Pick him up.” Simon hissed.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to be a dad, not, like, a dad with a one-year old!” Bryan shot back.<br />
<br />
Still, Bryan picked up the tiny child Jay had been reduced to and began rocking him in his arms. The baby continued to wail and sob. Simon rolled his eyes and was going to age the kid back up despite Bryan’s wishes when a loud thump came form upstairs.<br />
<br />
“You kids keep it down!’ Jay’s dad shouted.<br />
<br />
Jay wailed louder.<br />
<br />
Simon listened as he heard Jay’s dad begin stomping his way over to Jay’s room. Thinking quickly, he looked around for a button that he could press to undo everything. His eyes slid across the screen, but it wasn’t exactly a user-friendly interface.<br />
<br />
That’s when he saw the alter-reality function.<br />
<br />
Jay’s dad was coming down the hallway. Simon hurriedly clicked the alter-reality function and hit enter. The door slammed open, revealing Jay’s furious father, gut hanging out, just as a red light flashed from the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
The hallway was empty.<br />
<br />
Simon blinked. <br />
<br />
Where had Jay’s father gone? Jay had quieted down, Bryan rocking the baby in his arms and playing with the kid. His friend bent over and blew kisses on the baby’s tummy, making the small child giggle.<br />
<br />
Simon shifted in his seat, watching Bryan actually act like a father. It was cute, and Bryan was actually…kinda hot like this. Simon’s cock hardened as he realized Bryan might actually believe himself to be a real father. He adjusted himself again, his bones aching.<br />
<br />
He took a moment to look at Jay’s room again, and realized something was off. Simon’s shoulders felt wider and he had to adjust his seat because he’d grown a few inches taller. In the mirror nearby, he noticed his facial features shifting, looking more akin to Bryan’s. Even his hair changed, the brown shifting to a darker brown color.<br />
<br />
Somehow, he’d made himself Bryan’s son as well?<br />
<br />
But if that were true, why wasn’t he regressing as well-<br />
<br />
Almost as soon as the thought occurred to him, Simon realized the screen was rising up higher and higher above him. In the mirror, he saw himself growing more cute and boyish, his teeth falling out and being replaced by his baby teeth. His cock surged ever harder, balls churning heavily.<br />
<br />
“You okay pal?” Bryan said..<br />
<br />
Simon looked up at his dad and-<br />
<br />
His dad?<br />
<br />
Simon gave a small cry and began bucking his hips as his overloaded balls began to empty, his shrinking cock spewing a thick, creamy load into his sweatpants.It felt so good, alike pressure being released, but he realized his memories of being older was draining out of him as well.<br />
<br />
Bryan picked up the dwindling teenager and held him in a big bear hug.<br />
<br />
“Did you make a mess, kiddo?” Simon’s dad asked, his eyes pools of kindness and understanding.<br />
<br />
There was a squelch and wetness as Bryan firm paw squeezed Simon’s shrinking, sensitive junk. Simon bucked again, the last of his semen evacuating his shrinking testicles. Bryan continued to massaged the shrinking boy’s crotch, Simon writhing and whining with pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Wait, I~” Simon’s voice broke higher as his father ground his hand against his crotch. “Daddy, stop!”<br />
<br />
He hung his head over his father’s shoulders as the man practically squeezed his manhood back to prepubescence, shuddering. More pressure released, and Simon realized belatedly that it was his bladder emptying. Warmth trickled down his legs and made his socks soggy. He shivered. <br />
<br />
With one final grope, Bryan lifted his big mitt away from Simon’s crotch and noticed it was wet. He snorted ruefully, shaking his head and releasing Simon.<br />
<br />
“Sorry kiddo, guess you’ll need to be changed.” Bryan said, standing and going over to a chest of drawers and pulling out a new pair of underwear. “You know, if you keep making messes, I’ll have to put you in a diaper.”<br />
<br />
Simon flushed red, completely embarrassed. <br />
<br />
He shrugged out of his sweatpants and pulled up the underwear and jeans. In the mirror, he saw a young boy, maybe 7 years old, with a little nub of a penis and a completely hairless body. That was him now, he realized.<br />
<br />
His father waited patiently and took the cum-soaked dirty clothing and placed them in the hamper. Simon was surprised at how easily he’d allowed himself to start thinking of Bryan as his father. It…was a comfortable feeling. <br />
<br />
“Now get off your computer and go to bed.” Bryan chided.<br />
<br />
“Five more minutes dad!” Simon said.<br />
<br />
“Fine. But not a minute more.” Bryan said, walking off with the soiled clothes and heading to the laundry room.<br />
<br />
Simon waited for him to leave, then pulled up the Chronivac again.<br />
<br />
Being a poor white kid in a small apartment with a single father wasn’t so bad. However, he thought things could get more interesting. What if he were a different race? Like Asian or African or Mexican? Or rich! Why be some poor white kid when he could be…a rich black kid?<br />
<br />
Simon started typing things into the Chronivac, adjusting settings and sliders. <br />
<br />
He wanted to be handsome but cute. At 7, he was starting to reach the age where his skull shape would be finalized. With a few clicks, he made sure no matter what race he ended up being, he’d have a perfectly symmetrical face, a nice jawline, a good nose shape, and proper cheekbones.<br />
<br />
Then, he highlighted Bryan.<br />
<br />
As long as he changed Bryan, Jay and himself would be changed as well. He set his father’s race to African and altered his salary to one of a Hollywood producer. Then he went on to duplicate the general settings to make sure he was well-muscled, athletic, and charismatic. With a quivering finger, he hit enter, just as Bryan walked back into the room to tell him to go to sleep.<br />
<br />
“Okay kids,” Bryan said, his voice dropping an a octave deeper, becoming more melodious, “Time for bed.”<br />
<br />
Simon watched as Bryan’s skin seemed to tan, the shade growing darker and darker, before it stopped at a pleasant mocha color. His lips puffed slightly and his nostrils widened more than a tad. His long hair buzzed itself into a kinky fade. Finally, his body thinned, belly receding as his muscle inflated.<br />
<br />
As Bryan finished his Africanization, the rest of his clothing shifted. His t-shirt with a beer logo on it became an expensive white designer polo. Dirty sweatpants shifted into chinos and the room itself grew larger-way larger than two small kids would normally have.<br />
<br />
As the house shifted into a mansion, Simon’s own body began to change.<br />
<br />
His flesh pigmented, growing darker, though his skin wasn’t nearly as dark as Bryan’s. His hair was shaved close, a brush in Simon’s hand and the wave sin his hair indicating what he’d just been doing. Jay, in his crib nearby, also assumed a darker tone.<br />
<br />
Simon glanced in the mirror as his facial features shifted, lips puffing slightly and nostrils widening in a way similar to his dad’s, though not quite as pronounced. He supposed his mother had been white. He hissed in pain, flinching as two diamond studs appeared in his ear. They glittered in the light from his new ceiling fan.<br />
<br />
Of course they needed a ceiling fan. They lived in a mansion off Beverly Hills. He was in California, where his father worked in the movie industry.<br />
<br />
Memories filtered in of him wanting to have his ears pierced after landing the role in the new War Stars trilogy. His own clothes started to shift, from baggy cast-offs from Good Will to Nike sweaters and sweatpants. Everything in his room became expensive and brand-name and his entertainment system-and computer- became state of the art. He even saw 3d gear in the corner.<br />
<br />
When he turned to the Chronivac, he noticed a script had appeared on the screen.<br />
<br />
“You can read your parts in the new War Stars story later, kiddo,” Bryan said, gently closing the script and turning off the computer, “It’s time for bed.”<br />
<br />
“Yes daddy,” Simon said as his father lifted him bodily out of his seat and carrying him to bed. <br />
<br />
He was tucked in, kissed, and then his father turned off the light. Simon stared up at the ceiling, focusing on the glow-in-the-dark stars and planets that lay up there. It was so strange. <br />
<br />
Simon rolled over and fell asleep, eager to see what tomorrow held.</p>
