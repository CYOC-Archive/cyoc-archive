<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sei knew that that something was off; which bothered him only slightly. It had happened when he had been following Mike and he had decided to try opening one of the doors. Passing a room that was partly opened, he called out, &quot;Hold up. I wanna take a look in this room for just a minute,&quot; not realising that Mike had not heard him and was continuing onward.<br />
<br />
Looking into the room, he saw that it was a bathroom and it was just then he remembered that he had to really, really go. Turning his head, not paying the least bit of attention, he said, &quot;Wait a moment. I need to hit the head,&quot; and entered the room and shut the door.<br />
<br />
Thinking that the bathroom was rather bright and feminine looking, Sei shrugged, thought it kind of looked like the way his mom decorated and walked to the toilet.<br />
<br />
Reaching down, he grunted when he found that he could not lift up the seat, but the lid moved rather easily. Trying again, he found to no avail could he budge the seat. Squatting down, he looked at the lid and thought it odd that someone had permanently affixed the seat to the rest of the toilet.<br />
<br />
Feeling like he would have to make the most of it, he undid his pants, thought about it for a moment and then sat down to pee, telling himself, &quot;Probably not a good idea if I accidentally pee on the toilet seat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finished, he stood, flushed and fixing his pants, he walked to the sink to wash his hands. Turning about, he stopped short as he just realised something; before him was two doors and he could not remember which one he had entered from. Thinking they both looked the same, but were each on different walls, Sei closed his eyes and attempted to orient himself in the direction he had come from.<br />
<br />
Walking forward to one of the doors, he reached out and pulled down on the latch-like handle. When nothing happened, he thought, &quot;Must be locked from the other side,&quot; and turned to the other door.<br />
<br />
Reaching for the handle, which looked exactly like the other door handle, he pulled down and slowly opened the door. Gazing into a bedroom clearly designed with a little girl in mind, Sei thought, &quot;This can't be right,&quot; closed the door and turned back to the other door.<br />
<br />
Trying the handle again, he got nothing. Discouraged slightly, he squatted down and looked at the plate and handle. Seeing no hole for a key and no evidence that the door should be looked, he reached for the handle and tried again, this time pulling and then pushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this, some type of fun house,&quot; Sei asked himself after finally giving up on the door. Turning to the other door, he opened it and standing in the doorway, looked inward at the room.<br />
<br />
He could describe it in two words; bright and girly. The walls were painted pale pink, which was accented by a soft, plush white rug that ran from wall to wall, covering the whole floor. Next to the doorway was a nightstand with a light set atop it. Looking down, he saw a nightlight, the kind that light up when it gets dark, plugged into the wall.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the room, he looked at the bed, covered by a bright pink, purple, teal and white patchwork comforter. Gazing at it, he figured it had to be a single size. Looking around, he saw a wardrobe, a vanity, a full body mirror and a white dresser with a pink top and white knobs.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;It looks a little like my younger sisters room. From when she was about five,&quot; Sei told himself, suddenly thinking of the girl that was about one and a half years younger than him.<br />
<br />
In the center of the floor was a pretend tea set, complete with a couple of dolls. Looking at it, Sei suddenly remembers how when he and Sarah, his sister, where younger they would play together. Not having another friend to play with, Sarah would ask him. Seeing no problem, Sei would happily comply.<br />
<br />
From dress-up to house, Sei and Sarah played all sorts of games. This lasted until when Sei was about nine and he met Mike. A year later Sarah met her first friend and slowly the two drifted apart, growing up each with their friends instead of each other over time.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;Maybe I should try the door again,&quot; Sei stepped back into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Walking toward the door, Sei caught his foot on something and trying to regain his balance, he pitched toward the side and into the bathtub, which was full of warm water.<br />
<br />
Struggling about, flooding the floor, Sei thought, &quot;What the hell. Who filled this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pushing himself out of the bathtub, drenched, he looked around and thought that there was something off about this place. Walking toward the door that led into the bedroom, he paused and then decided that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to go through the room dripping wet.<br />
<br />
Taking off his clothes, he wrung out the excess wet over the bathtub, looked about for something that he could use to completely dry his clothes, saw nothing and instead folding them, he carried them into the next room.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the bed, he wondered what he should do. &quot;Obviously I can't wander about naked. That's indecent,&quot; Sei told himself, as he placed his damp clothes, after a moment’s thought, on the floor next to the bed. Standing, he looked around the room some more, trying in vain to look for a clue as to who this bedroom might belong to. After a bit, he saw that doors.<br />
<br />
Opening one that was along the same wall as the one in the bathroom, he was disappointed, and puzzled, when he suddenly found himself looking at a walk-in closet. Suddenly he smiled and giggled silently as he remembered the time he had gone swimming with his sister, dressed in one of her bathing suits. &quot;I was lucky no one caught me and that everyone we did encounter thought I was a little girl,&quot; Sei told himself as he closed the closet door and turned his attention to the other door.<br />
<br />
Opening it Sei found himself looking at a hallway that led off to the left. Peeking out, he saw what looked like a flight of stairs going down. Confused even more, he told himself, “It looks like the hallway at home, complete with my sister’s room across the way.” And closing the door he went back to the bed and lay down, liking the way the soft comforter felt and how it reminded him of a simple time.<br />
<br />
Sitting up, he told himself, &quot;Why not. I've got time to spare as I wait for my clothes to dry,&quot; and sliding off the bed, he walked toward the dresser.<br />
<br />
Opening it, he began to go through each drawer, remembering a time when it had been fun to play dress-up and it had not been hammered into his head that it was wrong for a boy to wear girl's clothing.<br />
<br />
Selecting a pair of underwear, he tucked his penis and testicles back, hoped that the panties would fit and sliding them on, he turned to the mirror. Gazing into the reflective surface, admiring how soft they felt and how much like a girl the underwear made him look, Sei shifted about. Bothered by the pinching sensation from his penis, testicles and between his legs and the odd fluttery sensation he suddenly had from his groin and abdomen, Sei briefly thought about taking the panties off, but then changed his mind.<br />
<br />
Turning to the walk-in closet, he opened it once again and entering, began to search through the dresses and costumes. Finally settling on a long, flowing pink number that that had a sash that when he tied it, Sei found it was cinched just about the middle of his abdomen. Looking into the mirror, amazed that the clothes fit, he thought, &quot;The way the sash is tide, it would really make the breasts stand out it a person had any.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unaware that he was shrinking, that his weight was deflating down, that his masculine features were disappearing and being replaced by those of a young girl of about four, Sei sat down at the tea-set, liking the way the dress felt. Wishing Sarah could be here he decided that for know his name would be Steph and then he picked up a doll. Cradling it in a motherly fashion, like Sarah had done when she was little, he picked up the plastic tea pot and in what he thought was a striking resemblance of a little girl's voice, asked, &quot;Tea ladies,&quot; and then began to mime the action of pouring tea. Somewhere nearby a dog barked, while someone howled in alarm. But Sei...now Steph...failed to hear it as she continued to play with her dolls, wishing her older sister Sarah would stop being mad with her and come in play with her.</p>
