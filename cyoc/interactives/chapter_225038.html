<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waking up, Andy sat up and felt his bare breasts jiggle, he sighed after looking down and seeing tits on his chest, he knew yesterday wasn’t a dream, after him and Ricky were done with the movie, Andy headed to bed after feeling pretty tired.<br />
<br />
Andy got out of bed and walked down to the bathroom, carrying towels and some of Rachel’s spare clothes from her room. he usually showered after his afternoon workouts, so nobody would be rushing him  at that time of day. Out of habit, Andy wanted to shower before college, Andy locked the bathroom door and turned the fan on. This shower would be quick, as today he focused on wanted to wash himself as quick as possible and not mess around in his new body. It took a mere fifteen minutes to wash his hair and scrub himself down. Andy stepped out of the shower and peered into the mirror at himself as he mussed his hair with one of his towels. As he looked, he noticed something new on the marble countertop: a fancy-looking electric toothbrush, along with several brush attachments, Jenny left her toothbrush and some hygiene products over as she was supposed to stay the night before Lauren caught her sucking Andy’s dick.<br />
<br />
“Of course she would have something like this”. Andy thought, knowing exactly who the toothbrush belonged to. If it related to hygiene, Jenny always had to own the most expensive brand possible. Andy didn&#39;t understand that way of thinking at all—cheap all-in-one shampoos and soaps worked perfectly well for him. Although, whatever Jenny did, it definitely worked. she always looked polished, not a hair out of place, and had a youthful glow that would never betray that she was almost twenty two years old. Plus, at least one of the products she used smelled like violets, making the scent waft around the bathroom. Andy felt his heartbeat thud in his chest as he thought about Jenny, and while he was naked, no less.<br />
<br />
The young man looked back at the toothbrush. It had an attachment he didn&#39;t recognize on it, just a small, textured plastic swab-looking thing. After a bit of squinting at the buttons, hd realized it must be a tongue cleaner, because none of the other options made sense.<br />
<br />
“So, that&#39;s been in...” Andy gripped his towel tighter, “Jenny&#39;s mouth…” Slowly, he turned back at the door. It was still locked. Slowly, he looked at the clock on the wall. It was still early. The boy turned girl turned back to the toothbrush, staring for a minute before dropping his towel and lunging his hand towards it. Grabbing it in his shaking fist, he took a few deep breaths before plunging it into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Andy&#39;s eyes fluttered shut as he closed his lips around the tongue scrubber. he licked and swirled his tongue around it. Quiet moans escaped the boy as he sucked the toothbrush. The faintest taste of Jenny’s mint toothpaste was left on the plastic, and he ravenously tried to suck the flavor off like it was a lollipop. This indirect kiss was as close as Andy could physically get to Jenny after Lauren altered reality to make it so they were best friends and not lovers, and by god he was going to savor every second of it.<br />
<br />
As Andy pushed the toothbrush deeper into his mouth, one of his fingers accidentally brushed the power button. The sudden movement made him jolt in surprise and quickly pull the device out of his mouth, a thin string of saliva connecting the tip to his lips for the briefest second before the buzzing split the strand. The boy held it in his hand, feeling the strong vibrations pulse in his grip. His eyes grew wider as he felt just how powerful the toothbrush was. He took a moment to consider... Was he really going to stoop so low?<br />
<br />
“I... I&#39;m sorry, Jenny...” Andy spread his legs apart and held the toothbrush near his crotch, “but I can&#39;t resist!” His entire body spasmed as he pressed the tip to his bare clit, shaking along with the electric vibrations. he started to rut against the brush, humping the empty air. Andy pushed another button, and it started to buzz faster. The boy gasped and arched forward, almost losing his balance with how hard his legs were shaking. hr pulled it away from his sex, gave it a smirk, and whispered, &quot;You and I are going to have a lot of fun together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy wobbled back over to the shower to sit on the edge, resting his feet in the tub. Spreading his legs open, he turned the toothbrush back on and started rubbing it against his clit again. The lowest setting was one thing, but on this higher setting Andy was having trouble keeping quiet. He quickly pressed the drain stopper down with his foot and cranked on the faucet of the bath. With the extra noise, he felt free to moan to his hearts content without worry of being caught.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmnh... Jenny...&quot; Andy  hummed as he used his free hand to spread himself open. he rubbed his labia, feeling himself get wetter as he imagined Jenny in front of him. What would he think of him if she saw all this? Actually, she&#39;d probably be disgusted that she was soiling her toothbrush like this. The woman did strike him as a germaphobe. But what if she wasn&#39;t?<br />
<br />
Andy imagined her standing there in the shower, towering over him and watching him masturbate to her.  Andy was already in so deep that even Jenny in her casual clothes  was enough to drive him crazy. The young man&#39;s legs began to tremble as he thought of her observing him with her usual cute half-smile on  her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to see we feel the same way about each other, Andy.&quot; He wanted her to calmly say as she watched him. &quot;But if you&#39;re going to borrow my belongings...&quot; Andy pulled the buzzing brush away from his clit while he imagined Jenny doing the same. &quot;I recommend you use them to the fullest extent possible.&quot; With the press of a button, the power was set to max and immediately shoved into Andy’s pussy. The sounds of rushing water drowned out him shriek from the sudden intrusion. Though it made him yelp, it didn&#39;t hurt by any means. In fact, it was quite the opposite.<br />
<br />
&quot;It entered you so easily.&quot; Jenny smirked, now crouching down to face him at eye level. &quot;Let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t find your sweet spot, hm?&quot; Andy whimpered in agreement as he felt the brush digging deeper inside him. Suddenly, he felt it ram a tiny patch inside him that made the boy inadvertently close his legs tighter together. &quot;Could this be it?&quot; Andy covered his mouth with one hand and nodded to himself. He clenched tighter around the toothbrush, trying to focus all of his energy on the power of the buzzing apparatus inside of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;J... enn... y...!&quot; Andy ground his hips onto the skinny little toothbrush, simultaneously wishing he had more girth to play with and feeling overwhelmed by the punch it packed in such a small form. he imagined her reaching down to lazily rub his clit with her other hand, and shivered as it made contact. In the back of his mind, he knew Jenny wasn&#39;t there and she would never condone this behavior, but a fantasy was a fantasy; he was out of it already, and the steam from the bath wasn&#39;t helping, making him even dizzier. &quot;Je...&quot; Andy grunted as he felt all of the muscles in his body tighten.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my toothbrush alone made you like this?&quot; Jenny started speeding up her hand to fuck her faster with the brush. Andy nodded, panting quietly.&quot;Thinking about indirectly kissing me got you this randy?&quot; He nodded again, his face starting to feel even hotter. &quot;How incredibly lewd of you. Nevertheless, I&#39;m flattered, and I accept your laudatory display as a compliment.&quot; Andy couldn&#39;t respond to any of her overly-eloquent comments. All he could do was listen to her voice ringing in his head and involuntarily clench his toes in the bathwater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to try the real thing?&quot; Andy saw her face inches in front of his. &quot;An actual kiss?&quot; The boy nodded and bucked his hips harder against the tool in her hand, hoping Jenny would take it as an unspoken affirmation. &quot;Right.&quot; As soon as she leaned in to kiss him, Andy clenched his eyes shut and saw stars behind his eyelids. The constant jabbing into his g-spot and his other hand jerking his clit without remorse finally became too much for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhah!?&quot; The sound of rushing water covered both Andy’s gasping and the small splashes of him squirting into the tub. &quot;Ohhhh... God...&quot; The boy switched the power to the lowest setting to ride out his orgasm before finally turning it off all the way and pulling the toothbrush out of him. It was completely dripping with his juices, sticky and creamy white in color. Andy took a few deep breaths, then turned off the faucet. Tossing the toothbrush to the floor, he slowly sank into the water, legs spread and completely spent.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, that was good...&quot; Andy stretched his arms and legs, unplugged the drain, and stood back up. He bent over to pick up the toothbrush and examine it. &quot;Better clean this.&quot; The boy ran it under hot water in the sink for several minutes before giving it a sniff and putting it back into its stand.</p>
