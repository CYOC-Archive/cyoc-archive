<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">the flames engulfed Hunter. soon then entered his eyes and mouth. the flames burned his inner head painlessly. the flame soon hollowed out Hunter&#39;s head. his new tongue-shaped flame hung out his mouth as his lips became jagged points.  <br />
<br />
the flesh of his head hardened into a more rounded shape. two small triangles pointed down over his eye sockets. all his other facial features sunk into his head. it soon turned orange as it turned into a pumpkin shell. his heart turned green and became his steam and leaves.  <br />
<br />
his new steam poked out a few centimeters out of his new leaf hairline. around his neck, more leaves grew. small vines poked out from his neck leaves. this made it look like a jack-o-lantern was sitting on top of a human body. he looked down only to find himself tumbling.  <br />
<br />
now on the ground, he struggled to right himself. using his vines he righted himself upwards. turning around showed his human body slowly changing. instead of a normal neck, he now had a mass of vines. these would allow him to detach his head at will.  <br />
<br />
he tried to raise his hand and found while separated he could still control it. &quot;this is awesome&quot; he said with his new voice. it now sounded like a deep man&#39;s echo. he watched as his pecs turned orange as well. his nipples turning a darker shade of orange as they became bumps on his pumpkin pecs.  <br />
<br />
between them his body hair turned to leaves as well. he raised his arms and saw a thick amount of tiny leaves now coating his armpits. around his pecs, more vines grew. curious he used his body to reach into the chest leaves. using his vines he pivoted his head to his back and saw his hand sticking out of where his spine should be.  <br />
<br />
instead, vines now made up his body. removing his hand he could see straight through his body before the vines regrew. speaking of his arms they were quickly becoming vines as well. Once they got to his forearms they shifted to a dull brown. he soon realized these were roots.  <br />
<br />
once his forearms were several tightly contacted roots they spread to his hands. he turned around and after much effort figured out how to pick up his head. he could feel the flesh shift to roots beneath his pumpkin head. he then put his head on backward as his fingers became pointed roots. unlike his forearms, his hands were singular solid objects.  <br />
<br />
he used his head vised to swivel his head 180 degrees. testing his vines he gripped the ones hidden in between his neck leaves. his head soon rose on a mass of vines and studied his changing body. he watched as his treasure trail became leaves dotting his abs. said abs were now tiny pumpkins that he could shift and twist at will.  <br />
<br />
around his new abs, more vines replaced his old skin. with every inch of his body changing he could feel and move it more than he could before. looking at his right hand he imagined a long lance. he watched as his fingers molded into one and out came a wooden lance. he then aimed at a dead oak tree and lunched his arm.  <br />
<br />
the vines allowing him to hit the tree without even having to move closer. after it left a hole in the tree he retracted his lance. As it returned it turned into its hand shape once again. suddenly he felt something wonderful. his pelvis had become vines as well.  <br />
<br />
his ass became vines as he no longer needed to eat that way. above his dick, his pubic hair became a thick mass of vines and leaves. he watched in lust as his cock turned a dark orange oblong pumpkin. its mushroom tip is now a lighter orange than the rest of his body. it grew till it hung till it was like a horse but still roughly human in shape.  <br />
<br />
below his cock his testicles grew as well. now hanging to his knees they became hollowed-out pumpkins. he soon felt the same comforting warmth and light inside them as he did his own head. he used his flame tongue to lick his jagged mouth as he grabbed his new cock. while bigger than his hand he was able to compensate.  <br />
<br />
his finger stretched around the shaft. he used several of his body vines to help him stimulate his cock. As he did the changes continued. the smaller vines wrapped around his sack. they began squeezing in time with each pump.  <br />
<br />
this caused Hunter to moan. flames escaping his mouth each time. his legs soon shifted to a mass of vines like the rest of his body. once it got to his knees they too turned to roots. unlike his hands, they became thicker and more inhuman the further down they went. once the changes got to his feet they shifted completely to roots. they dug into the ground as Hunter realized his load on the pumpkin patch.  <br />
<br />
this time the orange goop glowed as it sunk into the ground. hunter watched as a bunch of glowing mushrooms sprouted from the ground. he turned to see Midnight grinning at him. Hunter had forgotten he was there.  <br />
<br />
-step back through the fog...-  <br />
<br />
it said before pointing to his left. the fog that Hunter had come from reappeared. Hunter grinned as he walked into the fog. As he walked he used his vines to cover his genitals. he soon found himself right near the entrance.  <br />
<br />
concentrating real hard he saw a vine spring out of the ground beside him. it slinked past unsuspecting humans as it approached the car. a miniature jack-o-lantern appeared on its tip. it had two eyes. one of which was larger the the other one, the other looked like a crescent. it had a large smooth mouth.  <br />
<br />
using the vine it approached the car. realizing he lost the keys Hunter merely chuckled. two vines grew under the pumpkin and touched the car. Hunter then used his power to unlock the car. rolling down the window the vine entered and grabbed his phone.  <br />
<br />
it then placed the phone in its mouth and sunk into the earth. Hunter then had his first left ab rise to his face. hidden from plain view was the jack-o-lantern face that got his phone. it then opened its maw and pulled out his phone. he patted his pumpkin ab before returning it to its place. this time it&#39;s jack-o-lantern face showing as if it had earned it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps I can get Mom to bring her brother here. I hope he&#39;ll take after his big bro,&quot; he said as he made himself look buffer. he then headed to the haunted house. not in the traditional manner though. instead, he sunk into the ground and popped up next to his changed friends.  <br />
<br />
&quot;so we&#39;re just waiting on Holly and Lucy then,&quot; Adam said. &quot;it&#39;s actually Hunter now my friends,&quot; he exclaimed causing his transformed friends to jump and turn around in shock. &quot;not funny dude,&quot; Sam said as he tried to punch him. Hunter merely uncoiled his vines for his shoulder.  then once Sam recoiled from the shock he reattached them back together.  <br />
<br />
&quot;you really think you can harm an elemental of nature and Halloween?&quot; he grinned. suddenly he sensed Lucy coming. &quot;my friends our friend is almost here,&quot; he said as leaned against nothing. his roots digging into the ground to allow this feat.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Damien saw midnight actions. &quot;so why did you give him such power&quot; he smiled as he felt the spirit approach.  <br />
<br />
-I could sense he was more in tune with his untapped potential than most...- <br />
<br />
Damien nodded in approval as he watched more people become manly monsters. &quot;well at least you made him like me&quot; he said before taking his head off and putting it back on. unlike his friends, Hunter did not need a crystal. This was because the power of Halloween was a part of him now.</p>
