<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Heyyy, hold up.&quot; You turn the light back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it??&quot; Amber snaps at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to tell you something.&quot; You hold out your hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...kay?&quot; She reaches out in kind and lets you hold her, finger by finger.<br />
<br />
~You like me. You love me, and respect me absolutely. You&#39;ll happily do whatever I say.~<br />
<br />
You felt her body language shift. Her grip on your hands became tighter; she stood up straighter; she looked at you more intimately.<br />
<br />
&quot;...what was it?&quot; She asks, her tone perking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The thing you needed to tell me.&quot; She asks, swinging her hips a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Yeah. Wanna have sex?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
She snoots all the air out of her nose. Her face scrunches up and she holds her hands up to her chest--even as it takes your own hands up with her.<br />
&quot;Uhhh... uhhh yes... YES SIR!&quot; She blurts out, too embarrassed to maintain eye contact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; You let go and start guiding her to her bed.<br />
<br />
Amber holds her hands together at her hips.<br />
&quot;But... but like I don&#39;t kn-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m a virgin too. Let&#39;s have our first times together, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
She holds her hands up to her mouth and &#39;meeps&#39;.<br />
&quot;....okay....&quot; She whispers.<br />
<br />
You know, this attitude she&#39;s giving you is becoming a bit of a drag. You want something more fun.<br />
<br />
~You don&#39;t actually love or care that much about me, you just think I&#39;m cute. Forget about any productive hobbies or studious lifestyle you may have, you are a dumb slut with an IQ of 70--just above mentally retarded. You think that you have had sex hundreds of times already and that I am just the flavor of the week. Nothing matters more to you than getting laid, it&#39;s almost all you think about. You also think you&#39;re sterile and just don&#39;t give a fuck.~<br />
<br />
Alright, that was a mouthful, but seriously you were getting annoyed by Amber&#39;s puerile innocence. You don&#39;t actually care about this girl or her stupid family. You spent all this time learning the ins and outs of the sapphire, and honestly it was just out of idle curiosity and wanting to make sure you weren&#39;t about to mess something up. You don&#39;t need anything complicated or romantic, you just want to get laid. The sappy intimacy you were showing her a minute before...you thought you&#39;d be into it but it icked you out. Of course you don&#39;t have any affection for this brat, you just want her body. Stop kidding yourself as if you&#39;re some high-class manipulator. You&#39;re a shitty, horny boy who wants to lose his virginity. You want to abuse this innocent girl, and use her body as a piece of meat for your own pleasure. If you were somehow caught for this, you&#39;d probably get a life sentence and deserve it. So drop the pretenses, and stop pretending to like her. You just like her because she&#39;s a girl. Fuck her.<br />
<br />
To your surprise, Amber has already knelt down before you and whipped out your rising cock.<br />
&quot;Gotta get you slippy, bub!&quot; She says, a noticeable slowness to her voice that wasn&#39;t present before.<br />
<br />
She pops you in her mouth like she did that tooth brush. You let out a gasping moan as the teen manages your dick with stunning excellence. Perhaps you are easy to please with your lack of experience, but she does not have any experience either. Could it be that her belief that she is a expert sex-princess grants her a supreme &#39;fake it till you make it&#39; mentality? She won&#39;t stop!<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh, knock it off, you dumb bitch!&quot; You push her away from you. She rolls onto her back in a giggling fit. &quot;I was about to cum! I wanna lose my virginity in a vagina like God intended!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Owee. Is that so?&quot; She crawls up to you and yanks you shirt-wise onto the floor. &quot;Poor little virgin boy.&quot; She says, caressing your legs. &quot;Dummy little stupid head. Poopy stupid.&quot; She drags a finger ever-so-lightly against your shaft, causing you to wince from the sensitivity. &quot;Does dummy baby need his first sex? Is he a little dummy who doesn&#39;t know how girls are? Hmmm?&quot; She continues, giggling throughout.<br />
<br />
Well alright, reducing her mental capacity sure made her a lot less coherent and witty, but no less snarky. Honestly, it&#39;s kind of annoying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does mommy need to fuck little Danny? Does she?&quot; Amber continues, pulling up her shirt and thrusting her nipple into your mouth. You try to instinctively push it back with your tongue, but she holds you and forces you ever tighter. If she were a few sizes bigger, you would be having serious trouble breathing right about now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mfffphh!! Mmmm!!! Hghhmmm!!&quot; You mumble through the teat. You struggle against her borderline retard strength, but finally manage to slip out. &quot;Enough of you! You&#39;re insufferable!&quot;<br />
<br />
She keeps glaring at you, smiling wryly. You hate her. She&#39;s such an obnoxious cunt. Get rid of her.<br />
<br />
~You have no personality. You are mute. You don&#39;t speak unless spoken to. You just follow orders.~<br />
<br />
Amber stiffens up. Her smile leaves her face. She just sits there on the floor, limply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, good. Now,&quot; you clear your throat, &quot;have sex with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch as she stands up, removes her panties, and then crawls on top of you and starts grabbing for your dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no! Not like that!!&quot; You exclaim, feeling claustrophobic and like you got moved in on too fast.<br />
<br />
You watch as she interprets &#39;not like that&#39; as simply adjusting her position, as she starts turning around to a reverse cowgirl. On one hand, it&#39;s nice to know Amber has clearly watched plenty of porn (I mean, some girls don&#39;t masturbate, so it&#39;s nice to know), but you still feel overwhelmed right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Stop! Freeze!!&quot; You exclaim. You see her paused; her legs hunched over you; her crotch inches away from your skyward dick.<br />
<br />
You scamper out from underneath her.<br />
&quot;Sit down.&quot; You instruct. You take a quick glance down at her breasts, then back up. &quot;Okay...&quot; You catch your breath. &quot;Get on the bed.&quot; You instruct, before removing all your clothes like she had.<br />
<br />
You kneel on the bed&#39;s edge.<br />
&quot;Get on your hands and knees, and face your ass towards me.&quot; You say.<br />
<br />
You place a hand firmly on her butt, and just stare at it for a while. It&#39;s dark and you can&#39;t see it real clearly under the thin moonlight, but you seem to want to just look at her vagina for right now. Just... looking. You sigh, and proceed to move your hips towards her.<br />
<br />
...but you&#39;re not hard. You just smoosh your crotch up into her vulva, and nothing goes into anything.<br />
&quot;Uh, uh hold on.&quot; You stammer. You kneel down a bit more, and start touching her vagina. You keep just sort of rubbing your floppy dick up against it. Nothing happens. Your heart rate is going down. You&#39;re getting cold from being naked at night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man... just... fuck this.&quot; You say. Amber starts moving her hips in and out against your crotch. &quot;No! Not literally! Ugh, just stop. Lay flat on your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit on the bed next to her. You stare at her blank, emotionless face.<br />
<br />
~Just... be yourself.~<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what that means.&quot; Amber replies, more stoically than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh...&quot; You mutter, staring out the window and thinking about it for a minute.<br />
~Fifteen minutes after I finish this command, all of my commands on you will be deactivated. Anything I have told you to think or feel will be null and void. And at the same time, you will forget all about me. You won&#39;t remember tonight, and you won&#39;t remember any of the stuff we did, and you will have no memory of Daniel Kelly-Woods.~<br />
<br />
You look back at her; no reaction present because her &#39;don&#39;t do anything unless told&#39; command is still going to be in effect for another fourteen minutes and fifty-six seconds.<br />
<br />
You take the clothes that she had put you in and stuff them away in her hamper, then dress yourself back up in your own clothing. Sure it was a pre-shower outfit, but what else could you wear?<br />
<br />
You give her one last look-over before heading out the room. You tip-toed over to Madison&#39;s room and shot her a similar command, of nullifying and forgetting everything. You finished it off with the same to the mom and dad, then got the hell out of this house.<br />
<br />
You finally made it home, not needing to even perform hypnotics on your mom to get her off your back about showing up at 1am. You just went up to your room, and fapped to your regular porn.<br />
<br />
You lie in bed, looking out at the stars. Maybe getting people to do things for you loses its appeal when you have unlimited control over them. Maybe you need to add a little finesse to your mental-manipulation game. Whatever, just go to sleep for now. Actually, come to think of it, can you make commands on yourself?<br />
<br />
~Go to sleep.~<br />
<br />
...guess not. You pop in your ear buds and play ambient music.</p>
