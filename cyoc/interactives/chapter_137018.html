<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria rubbed her eyes sleepily as she tried to adjust to the light in the room. She had been sleeping when Katie had materialized inside her room, saying their was something important she needed to see. As the 14 year old now tried to wake up she saw Katie, Kellie and another girl enter the room.<br />
<br />
“Katie,” she groaned. “What am I doing here? I was out cold. Now I’m sitting here in my jammies and my hair is a mess.”<br />
<br />
“Cmon sis you know you always look good no matter what.”<br />
<br />
Gloria frowned as she listened to the voice. She didn’t recognize it and wondered who it could be. Rubbing her eyes she now gazed at a red headed teen who looked around her age. “Who are you?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Katie sighed. “Your not going to believe this Glo But this is our sister from the future. Her names Lynne.”<br />
<br />
Gloria’s eyes flew open as the cheerful redhead smiled and waved. “Huh,” she answered. “How is that possible and secondly do you actually believe that.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Katie said solemnly. “I checked our auras they match. I want you to use the blood test magic I showed you to confirm what I already know.” Gloria gazed at her sister, instinctive drawing her hands behind her. “Why do I have to do the blood test,” she whined. “I mean your her sister too. You do the blood test.”<br />
<br />
“I would if I could Gloria,” Katie sighed. “But remember Lisa adopted me so I’m not a blood relation. You and Lynne would share a common parent so the test should show if your related.” Gloria groaned in frustration, Katie was right. “Ugh fine,” she groaned. “I hate needles though, can someone just take my blood so I don’t have too?”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded in reply as she approached Gloria. Gloria turned her head, wincing as Kellie drew a drop of blood from her finger tip. “Sorry Gloria,” she said quietly. Placing a drop of blood on an index card she now placed it on a nearby coffee table. “Okay Lynne your turn.”<br />
<br />
Lynne smiled confidently as she strode towards the table. Taking the needle she pricked her finger, letting a drop fall on an adjacent card. “Okay that will do,” Katie said. Lynne nodded as Katie stepped forward. Muttering a spell the girls watched as the cards glowed slightly. In seconds they saw as the two drops of blood drew close to one another. As it did Gloria gaped at the young teen.<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh,” Gloria gasped. “You are my sister.”<br />
<br />
“Told ya,” Lynne smirked. <br />
<br />
Gloria just stared wide eyed at the girl, still trying to shake the sleep from her eyes and wrap her mind around this. As she now began to regain her bearings she glared at her little sister. “How did you get here,” she exclaimed. “Also What is with you, do you just like causing mischief or something?”<br />
<br />
“What,” Lynne cried. “What are you talking about? I mean sure everyone says I remind them of mom when Inwas her age but I don’t just go around causing trouble for no reason.”<br />
<br />
Gloria folded her arms as she narrowed her eyes. “Then how do you explain what happened with Aunt Ann after Thanksgiving?”<br />
<br />
Lynne blushed slightly before chuckling. “Oh yeah that,” she giggled. “Yeah I heard that story. Sorry I really don’t have an answer for that one, I mean I wasn’t even born yet so my magic I guess got a bit out of control. Still apologizing to Aunt Ann for that and a couple of other things that happened to her when mom was pregnant with me,”<br />
<br />
Gloria and Katie gave each other looks of concern. Obviously things were going to be interesting throughout Lisa’s pregnancy. Realizing they would have to give Ann a heads up later the two now turned to Lynne once more wanting answers.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Gloria sighed. “So your our kid sister. What made you want to come here?”<br />
<br />
Lynne frowned as she looked at Gloria. “Really kid sister,” she said flatly. “In case you hadn’t noticed were the same age Gloria. Ugh why is no matter what age you are you always have that super serious look.”<br />
<br />
Gloria frowned, ready to say something before Katie stepped in between the two. “Okay can we save the sibling rivalry for later,” she groaned. “Right now we need some answers. Gloria is right though Lynne why are you here?”<br />
<br />
Lynne looked up at her older sibling, Katie had always been the level headed one in the family as well as Lynne’s magical teacher. While she usually got along with Gloria she just couldn’t help taking a dig at her all powerful sister, seeing her when she was just beginning to understand her power. “Your right,” Lynne conceded. “Sorry Gloria about that. Just seeing you as a kid made me want to poke fun, your usually the mature one and umm kinda my hero.”<br />
<br />
“Uh Thanks,” Gloria answered, slightly stunned. <br />
<br />
“Well,” Lynne sighed. “Now that we got that out of the way I’ll tell you why I’m here. You know that other timeline you’ve been visiting recently Katie? Turns out that the sorceress you were so worried about found a way here. She made a couple of attempts to kidnap me.”<br />
<br />
Katie gaped as she looked between Kellie, Gloria and Lynne. Her worst fears were now being confirmed. “oh no,” she whispered. “Is...is everything okay with you though? You weren’t hurt were you?”<br />
<br />
“Naw I’m fine,” Lynne said nonchalantly. “Your mom helped us out on a couple of occasions. Still the first time was the worst. I...I came back here to give you a heads up. When she shows up the first time...something bad happens.”<br />
<br />
“Wait hold on,” Gloria exclaimed. “What do you mean something bad happens and how did Katie’s mom help? Shes in another timeline.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah Aunt Kellie will be visiting soon along with a few of her friends,” Lynne said. “When she found out about mom being preganant she wanted to wish her congratulations. The reunion was....interesting. A happy event but interesting.”<br />
<br />
“I can imagine,” Gloria said quietly. <br />
<br />
“You’ll see when it happens,” Lynne laughed. “Trust me everything goes well. Shortly afterwards though is when...she showed up.”<br />
<br />
Lynne grew quiet as she now hung her head sadly. “She..she was too strong,” she whispered. “Even stronger than you and Katie. If it wasn’t for Aunt Kellie and the others I...I might not be here. All of you combined were able to drive her off.  But, there was a cost. Gloria....I’m sorry but one of your friends dies as a result.”<br />
<br />
Gloria stared in shock as the young teen stared sadly at the floor. “Who,” she yelled. “Who was it?”<br />
<br />
“I...I can’t tell you,” she whimpered. “I talked with Merlin about this before I cast the spell that brought me here. He said that if I give you the persons name then you won’t be able to stop history from repeating itself. I know it sounds far fetched, I didn’t believe it either but he’s never been wrong. I’m here to tell you though that at the beginning of June..she will come, so you need to start getting ready. If you don’t history will repeat itself or worse....she wins.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Gloria now stared at each other solemnly, the joy of having a sister now had a dark cloud looming over it. In six short months they would be confronted with something more powerful than either has has to deal with previously. If they were going to keep everyone safe they would need to begin preparing for the worst.</p>
