<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hikari and Merlins meeting was quiet and secretive. As his daughter and her friends began their magical training, the two magical beings met in Merlins study.<br />
<br />
Merlin had been anxious to find out what Hikari knew and she was more than happy to assist. Unfortunately Liliths actions had divided the Kitsune community. Some understood Liliths actions, despite their brutality. Those members, while not outwardly oppose her, would search for ways to stop her. <br />
<br />
Other members though were not so forgiving. While angered at Yomi&#39;s actions, they were even angrier at Merlin and Lilith teaming up to destroy her. These Kitsune viewed not only Lilith, but Merlin and his family as enemies. Hikari warned Merlin that these kitsune may try to cross into the other timeline and take revenge against Katie and the others. Merlin thanked Hikari for the information and told her he would warn them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you Hikari,&quot; Merlin said solemnly. &quot;I shall take the necessary precautions. Have you learned of any weakness Lilith may have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regrettably no,&quot; Hikari sighed. &quot;However, Morgan had no discernable weakness either. I shall let you know if I discover anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin thanked the kitsune for her time before seeing her out. As Hikari journeyed through the nearby woods, she now thought of their current situation. Merlin had inadvertently made a few more enemies. Most of the kitsune understood Merlin and Liliths temporary alliance but their were some who considered Liliths brutality unforgivable. They understood trying to take on Lilith currently would be suicide so they would take out her allies before making a move against her. Hikar now hoped calmer heads would prevail on her side.<br />
<br />
Hikari stopped suddenly, anxiously gazing around the forest. She had sensed a magical presence nearby. As she tried to conceal herself, she suddenly felt a jolt of energy paralyze her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello abomination.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari turned her head, growling as she watched Lilith approach. &quot;You,&quot; she sneered. &quot;I should of known a demon would not keep their word. You may take my life but know others will come for you demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith grinned, giggling girlishly as she approached the frozen kitsune. &quot;Kill you,&quot; she giggled. &quot;Oh poor sweet Hikari, I&#39;m not going to kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith made a small motion with her hand, causing Hikari to be suspended in the air. &quot;I gave my word,&quot; she said. &quot;I would not take your life. I have something much more entertaining in store for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari watched curiously as the demon witch slowly paced back and forth. &quot;I know some of your kind blame Merlin for what happened to your sister,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;It is a small minority, one I am looking to increase. You see, I need to weaken Merlin and his daughter for my son to assume his rightful place. Merlin&#39;s followers often dabble in transformative and temporal magics. I wonder kitsune, how would those magics affect you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari stared at Lilith wide eyed as she began to cast a spell. Hilari felt an odd sensation course through her body. Stunned into silence she watched a small smirk spread across Liliths face. &quot;What are you do....&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari paused as she noticed a small movement to her side. Turning quickly she noticed one of her eight tails twitch ever so slightly. Horror struck she watched as the tail began to grow smaller, slowly but surely shrinking until it vanished once more into her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My goodness it worked,&quot; Lilith whispered. Turning she smiled at the angry kitsune. &quot;My dear Hikari,&quot; she said. &quot;It appears the legends are true. Kitsune gain their tails as they age. Congratulations I have now wiped away hundred years from your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari screamed in pure rage as Lilith looked on. She could sense that the kitsune magic had diminished with the loss of age and her tail. Before she would have made a formidable foe, which is why Lilith had used stealth to attack. Having lost one of her tails and a hundred years of magical power, she was now a little more manageable.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know why you are so angry creature,&quot; Lilith smirked. &quot;Is it not every mortals wish to be young.&quot; Lilith rubbed her chin, an impish smirk on her face as she gazed at the now seven tail kitsune. &quot;Now I understand,&quot; she grinned. &quot;You wish to be younger. Well, so be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari howled in rage and terror as Lilith once again began to work her magic. Cursing the witch with every breath she gazed in horror as her body slowly but surely began to toughen. Lilith seemed to delight in this torture, going so far as to conjure a mirror so Hikari could watch.<br />
<br />
Hikari was near tears as one by one her tails slowly shrank away. With the loss of each tail Hikari could feel her power wane. She was not only becoming younger, she was becoming weaker; losing wisdom and memories of her adulthood. Seven tails became six, the five, then four. Hikari was quickly losing all her adult maturity and strength, she was quickly becoming just a frightened child.<br />
<br />
Lilith had planned for Hikaris downfall after she had mentioned her first husband. While at first it was only for revenge she decided on a different plan of attack. Even a very young kitsune could travel between worlds. Lilith only needed to revert Hikari to a frightened child so that she could gain access to the other timeline.<br />
<br />
Hikari was near mindless with fright as she watched her third tail slowly shrink away, leaving her a two tail kitsune. Liliths spell was robbing her of her power and memory. She had only the faintest idea of her adulthood now. As she tried to grasp onto it it seemed to vanish like mist. &quot;Please let me go,&quot; she whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Lilith stated. Lilith watched as Hikaris second tail now began to shrink. The juvenile kitsune was losing her powers rapidly now, making suspending her in the air much easier. Lilith now began to enact the second part of her plan. She began to implant a single thought into Hikaris mind. Flee to Katie&#39;s timeline.<br />
<br />
Lilith watched as Hikaris second tail vanished, leaving the kitsune with only a single tail. Now the changes were quite noticeable on the young kitsune. Hikari&#39;s features began to soften as she began growing ever younger. The kitsunes adult curves slowly began to erode as her facial features softened. As Lilith completed her spell and released Hikari from the spell holding her in place she smiled. The kitsune now appeared to be a young teen with slight curves and a youthful cox like face. <br />
<br />
Hikari rubbed her eyes as she now tried to make out her surroundings. This place did not seem like Hokkaido. She remembered going for a walk in the woods. A walk her parents would most likely disapprove of. Everything seemed so foggy, except one thing, A demon witch. Looking up the teenage kitsune gasped in horror as she gazed at Merlin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your the witch,&quot; she shrieked, her voice trembling and juvenile. Lilith grinned maliciously as she now slowly approached. &quot;Yes I am girl,&quot; she snarled. &quot;Now run on home before I make a fur coat out of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hikari shrieked in terror as she now opened a portal between the worlds. She was unsure of where home was but she remembered a group of female mortals a little older than herself. As the portal opened Hikari kept through to safety.<br />
<br />
Lilith smiled as she used her magical to forcibly hold the portal open. She had been unable to open a window between the worlds. Only Merlin had the spell and he was unwilling to share. By using the kitsunes ability to travel between worlds Lilith had found a loophole. Now she could take steps to assuring Jack dominated not only this timeline but the other one as well.</p>
