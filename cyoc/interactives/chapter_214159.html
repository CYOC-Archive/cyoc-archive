<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, Whitney took a fair amount of relief at Simon&#39;s advice regarding some of the potential issues that related to romantic interests that might be there for her daughters. This related to issues of control that would be there for Lucy and Melody, as Whitney had noted some of the attention her eldest daughter gave to Simon&#39;s daughter. Some of it was also with her younger daughter&#39;s potential hopes for the future, and she found Simon to be quite calm and understanding in providing his advice to Zoe regarding Maize. Whitney had never known of Maize&#39;s leanings before and really only understood the basics about the base instincts that Slug People had. That latter issue was obvious given how short of a time the Chapmans had been Slug People. The compassion Simon showed relieved Whitney and she sensed some signs of relief in Zoe and Grace as well.<br />
<br />
Though, Whitney also knew that these thoughts and things were only going to be a distraction for the moment. Something that couldn&#39;t seriously dealt with until after Edward Cupple was no longer a threat to them, and that possibly included saving the Slug People that he had likely enslaved. Though, without much in the way of ideas or plans on how to do so, particularly with reminders that they&#39;d have to follow the law with regard to the issues surrounding the dealing with Cupple. The other distraction for the moment was waiting for dinner, and Simon was providing the three Chapman females with generous hospitality and even putting some effort into getting dinner ready. To a degree, Whitney wished she could help, but she was glad to still have Simon&#39;s kindness and everything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some other things worth discussing, Mrs. Chapman, you&#39;re willing,&quot; Simon spoke as he finished cutting the bones out of the chicken breasts he&#39;d been working with. Zoe and Grace also looked to this, though more out of curiosity than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would that be?&quot; Whitney asked carefully. <br />
<br />
She was curious too, but there were some things that she&#39;d be concerned about. Simon was a striking male, and a part of Whitney&#39;s mind was interested in him, and she had all she could do to keep herself from openly flirting with him, even with Grace and Zoe there as well. But the memories of watching Cupple try to enslave her children and attack Jeff with his sorcery kept her more focused on what would be needed to defeat him was her main goal and one she couldn&#39;t deviate from. Defeating Cupple would keep her family free and would let her children finish college and everything else related to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly the things that will come once Cupple is defeated,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;especially if you wish to reclaim your home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... there is that,&quot; Whitney said slowly, while also thinking on what would be coming when the summer ended. Jeff and Lucy would be beginning their senior year in college, Zoe her junior year, and Grace her sophomore year. Whitney expected that the family would stay together for a while, but it wouldn&#39;t be too long before they began to split up a strike out on their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will bring about its own responsibilities and issues,&quot; Simon spoke, more in warning than anything else, and Whitney thought she sensed some degree of nervousness in him. &quot;Much of this will relate to how Slug People have lived alongside humanity. A lot of our low level magics have managed to prevent outright murder, but that hasn&#39;t always made things easy. As humans are not as sexual as we are... and many have fairly firm beliefs against relations within families.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would lead to humans finding the fact that Slug People&#39;s DNA seems to be in a sort of flux that would prevent incestuous relationships from creating the genetic problems that are there with just about everything else,&quot; Grace said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Simon nodded, &quot;humans miss on how much magic plays into many of the things we can do and protecting our &quot;genetics&quot; is one of them. Though... I&#39;ve also noticed that humans have their own odd takes on these things, as many royal families have often intermarried to the point of inbreeding because &quot;nobles cannot mix with peasants&quot; and things like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They wouldn&#39;t do that to me... I mean, my husband I bought that home when Jeff and Lucy were only one year old,&quot; Whitney said slowly, &quot;they...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They would probably let you live there,&quot; Simon replied as he turned to place the chicken in some baking pans and then turned to start warming up the oven, &quot;that&#39;s partially where some of our magic will come in. But they would look to treat your home as a new colony and will have new regulations they&#39;d want you to follow. Likely to make sure that you aren&#39;t forcing humans to become Slug People or anything like that. Those things happen... but they&#39;d want to make sure things are legal and willing. Thus, when your son or daughters take mates that were human... they will want paperwork filled out that affirms things were willing before the transformation is carried out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean... I&#39;d have to fill out paperwork... just to be with Maize?!&quot; Zoe asked, &quot;I mean... if it does become love and all that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily you, but your mother, as she would be expected to be the leader of the new colony,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;and we&#39;ve generally agreed to this as a rule, both to prevent things from escalating into war and to provide avenues for our species to coexist as best they can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean... they&#39;d treat my family as a new colony?&quot; Whitney asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a new colony... a new hive, yes,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;and because it&#39;s all from within a family, you as the parental figure would be seen as the leader, even if you delegate that role to your eldest children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what would I need to do?&quot; Whitney asked carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Largely just to follow some of the base rules that will be expected from any new colony,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;this would include some measure of registration and contact between you and the city authorities, at least... and if we can prove Cupple as the cause of this, they may even help with some of the specifics. Sort of as repayment for Cupple&#39;s actions putting you in a tough position.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s something of a relief,&quot; Whitney grumbled and rolled her eyestalks for a moment, and this was something that Simon did pick up on as the oven beeped to indicate it was warm and ready. He then put the chicken in the oven to begin cooking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not as complicated as it sounds,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;frustrating, maybe, but not all that complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Following a lot of random rules comes with all that,&quot; Zoe pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That can&#39;t be changed, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Simon answered, &quot;as many of those rules were there when this country won its independence from Britain, and the countries in Europe have similar rules that were passed almost as soon as my race was discovered by the governments in charge. That&#39;s sort of the way the world works. The only other way would be for you to move your family into the colony here, and that would let all that responsibility fall to me... at least until the next election for the role of mayor for the colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s not too complicated...&quot; Whitney said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine with filling out whatever paperwork is required. It is my home, and I would like to keep it. Both for my own ownership... and memories of my husband and the family we raised, and not to tax you anymore than we are now while trying to defeat Cupple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Simon answered with a friendly smile, &quot;but trust me... you aren&#39;t a burden to me or anyone else here. And because you were the victim of Cupple&#39;s magic... the colony would do what it can even if you were felt to be a burden. For people do recognize our magic and could turn on us if we don&#39;t stop Cupple quickly... or he may grow too powerful to stop. All of which shows a reason to work together. It&#39;d be irresponsible of me not to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we thank you for your help, sir,&quot; Grace spoke.</p>
