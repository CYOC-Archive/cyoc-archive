<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...nothing. She glanced around and couldn’t spot a thing. Maybe she was working too hard. She had been up a long time. Maybe she should have spent time with Matt. It wasn’t right to have said no to him like that. She’d make it up to him tomorrow.<br />
<br />
 She lay back in her chair and thought about going to bed. She pulled her top over her head, knowing that her sister and Parents weren’t coming in now they had all gone to bed. Olivia might stay up a bit longer but she wasn’t going to come in. Clare, for all her shyness liked the thrill of sitting in her room in nothing but her underwear. She pulled down her jeans and did just that, almost drifting off to sleep then and there. She became increasingly hot and closed her eyes, breathing heavily.  Maybe she should open the window. Then she felt it again, the shiver down her spine, yet this time it didn’t stop there, it continued downwards. It got past the base of her spine to her bum, caressing her underwear gently. Clare didn’t know what was happening but dismissed it on account of the pleasant feeling.  It felt like it was pressing through the material of her panties, rather than a shiver on her skin. ‘That couldn’t be right’ she thought to herself. Her fears were confirmed however when the caressing stopped and the mysterious force cupped her ass.<br />
<br />
Now she was scared. These invisible hands had just caressed her ass while she sat there in her underwear she looked round to see if she could see anything but couldn’t. Meanwhile the invisible hands travelled round her waist. One sank lower caressing her womanhood through the soft material. Clare didn’t know what to do. She tried to move but couldn’t. She couldn’t raise herself out of the seat, all she could do was squirm. This seemed only to excite the force. It continued with one hand, still invisible, to caresses her through her underwear whilst the other rubbed her stomach in soft circles. Matt had done something similar once but they had been fully clothed, in the park in fact. Clare hoped and prayed that this would be over soon. She tried to speak, to tell it to stop but her voice wasn’t working.<br />
<br />
The hands got more vigorous with the higher one travelling upwards, to her breast, clad in a matching bra to her panties. It brushed past them and Clare let out a small squeak, though of terror or pleasure not even she knew.  She now had a hand on each of her private areas, areas that even clad in the bare minimum, few had ever seen. They took the squeak as there queue it seems and progressed now to what Clare had been dreading. Slowly the hand on her breast reached for the material and tugged on it gently, slowly, now releasing to the air her left breast, nipple erect. If Clare had had movement of her arms she would have instantly made to cover it and she fought the paralysis to do so. The hand began to cup and caress it, moving over it slowly. From its dexterity Clare knew it was a hand now. She could feel it as clear as if it were corporeal.<br />
<br />
The second hand made a pressured movement, dragging a finger upwards which caused a jolt of pleasure through Clare. When it got to the elastic it lifted it, but unlike the bra the panties were not removed. Instead the hand waited a moment and proceeded, painstakingly slowly under the silk. Clare knew there was nothing she could do. She felt it travel slowly, through her pubic hair, pausing and progressing systematically, tracing little circles on her skin, driving her mad. She managed to lean her head forward and see the shape of the hand through the material. She couldn’t believe this was happening. Why was it happening? This unearthly force was about to go further than she had ever been with her boyfriend. She was an adult though, approaching 18, it wasn’t like she hadn’t experimented. She knew the joys of self pleasure, of masturbation. She had even walked in on Olivia once, though backed out before she noticed.<br />
<br />
The lower hand paused before the opening to her most sacred of places and Clare mentally prepared herself for what she knew was the next step. Slowly, a single finger entered her pussy. A jolt of pleasure jumped up Clare’s spine and the Second hand started to caress her breast more vigorously.  She squirmed and writhed out of a combination of pleasure and horror. This made things worse however and the hand built up a motion, In, Out, In, Out, until Clare started to buck her hips in time. The hand on her breasts too started a motion, cupping the breast and lifting it, then brushing over the nipple. It was enough to drive her mad. She let out small pants, moans, but tried her hardest for no more. She knew her parents were close by and her sister too. A squelching could be heard from her pussy now as the hands continued their assault on her senses. The speed increased and Clare knew she was fast approaching her limit.<br />
<br />
She moved her hand up to start pleasuring the other breast whilst her other hand moved down to her loins to meet the ghostly hand already providing her with so much. They continued and Clare felt herself rising, caressing herself in time with the motions of the hands until, with a final last push she arched her back and let out a long moan as juices came squirting from nether regions, further dampening the already soaked panties. She continued for a moment writhing until she collapsed on the chair she had not moved from. The shock of what had just happened still fresh in her mind. She had just been raped for all intensive purposes. Yes, raped. It was horrible, having someone else toy with her body like that. But she couldn’t help but feel warm. She had just had the best Climax she had ever had, and, more importantly she realized, she had been realised from her confines and done nothing to stop it, in fact aiding it was more accurate. She had caressed herself and aided the phantom hands, which had now disappeared. What was she thinking? She could have got up and run but she didn’t. These thoughts flooded her mind, but the pleasure from the event was still fresh there. She removed her bra completely now and rose to take the sodden panties off. She could still feel herself wet from the activity but had no idea what to do now.</p>
