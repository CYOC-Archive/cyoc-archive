<br />
Christ only had a moment to take in as much as he could, some of it was certainly a surprise but it could barely register it before his felt his entire body tingling. The first thing he noticed was having to adjust the way he sat in his chair. Chris was tallish and lanky, his father was tall and he seemed to be following suit, having just come out of a growth spurt and was still mostly limbs. But if those stats shown were right he was about to lose all the height he had gained.<br />
<br />
Correction. He was losing it. It felt like something was pushing on him, compressing him down, but it wasn&#39;t altogether unpleasant. His limbs were shortening, as well. But his height seemed to be turning into thickness, even as he got shorter his frame broadened. His shoulders began spreading wider, his rib cage barreling out a bit, and his limbs were just thicker. He hadn&#39;t put on any muscle, yet, it looked like he would soon, but everything was still sturdier stockier. His hands actually looked bigger, so did his feet, though his one just long enough jeans bunched at his ankles. His size medium shirt was becoming unpleasantly tight, as was the waistband of his size slim jeans. He quickly pulled off his shirt and tossed it aside, though the button on his jeans popped and ricocheted off the computer monitor before he could get to it. Standing up he shucked off his pants too, leaving him standing in just boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
Standing he noticed the height difference more than before, though it wasn&#39;t too strange. He moved over to the mirror on his closet door and his eyes widened a bit in shock. He looked like his head plopped on the wrong body. Thick torso, shorter legs, though his arms looked a little long for his body they were shorter than before. Staring at his chest, he noticed the next change setting in, he /had/ a chest. Rather it was more defined. He had pecs, and they seemed to swell a little larger with each breath he took. He reached up to squeeze one and noticed the ball of muscle pop out on his arm where his biceps were, not huge, but he definitely no longer had noodles for arms. There was even creases forming on his previous flat stomach, the start of defines abs. Over two hundred pounds on this frame? He was going to be a beast.<br />
<br />
But as he was examining his body, he missed the changes overcoming his face. After all, this was changes to him, he had decided to become a whole new person, and this person didn&#39;t look at all like he was related to Chris Sanderson. His dark brown hair had been lightening to a sandy blond, shortening from a few inches of unruly mess into a short, neat crew cut, and his brows from delicate arches into heavy, thick lines. Chris had gotten some fairly delicate facial features from his mother, but those were vanishing behind Shane&#39;s blocky face. His jaw squared out, and his nose thickened but upturned a little at the end. Strangely the bridge looked a little crooked, as if it had been broken before. Just noticing that caused him to remember falling out of a tree when he was ten and breaking it. That.. had never happened to Chris. But he remembered it.<br />
<br />
He also remembered his dad, no, not his dad, Shane&#39;s dad teaching him how to shave once he noticed his upper lip and chin darkening with stubble. Chris hadn&#39;t even had to figure out a razor yet. Shane had to learn at twelve. That much was obvious by the amount of stubble on his chin and jaw. He could probably grow a fairly decent beard if he wanted to give it a try and he was what? Eighteen? But it kept to stubble, and it itched growing in. And it wasn&#39;t the only place he itched. Most of him did.<br />
<br />
He took a step back, as if it would give him a better look at himself, and noticed a trail of hair growing up his stomach which hadn&#39;t been there last time he looked. Dark blond like the hair on his head, and growing up the middle of what was now a very obvious four-pack. The peach fuzz he had had on his lower arms and legs was growing in thicker as well, creeping up slowly towards his knees and elbows. With a sudden thought he grabbed the waistband of his underwear and tugged it down. Sure enough his once sparse pubes were now a thick bush, though trimmed short. He knew they were trimmed, he could remember doing so now. He didn&#39;t want to shave them though, hair was a sign of being a man, and he was proud of his hairiness. No.. Chris found hairiness kind of gross and had been thankful for his genetics. Shane was grateful for his genetics, too, but for the other reason. A man should have hair, groomed, but it should be there. He was almost disappointed though that his cock didn&#39;t seem any bigger. No.. wait.. it was definitely thicker, and his balls were larger and hung a bit lower. It just wasn&#39;t longer, at the moment. Shane knew he was a grower. He always loved seeing a guy&#39;s look of surprise when they saw him get erect and go from five inches to over nine, no wonder flaccid he was still thick as a soda can. And.. what was that? Foreskin. He had his foreskin back. It looked strange, but right.<br />
<br />
Wait.. a guy&#39;s face? It was Chris&#39; memory that came. Seeing homosexual under Shane&#39;s stats. It was one of the things he didn&#39;t really have time to process but now that he was thinking about it, what was the problem? He was strong, fit, and he liked his guys the same way. Sex was best when there was strength and power involved. He struck a double bicep pose in the mirror, showing off muscles that had continued to swell with vigor, and thick patches of hair in his pits. Hair had begun to grow in the cleavage between his meaty pecs as well. It was short, but obvious. Thick, but like his pubes he kept it trimmed. He knew from times when he hadn&#39;t bothered for a few weeks to trim it could turn into a curly forest pretty quickly, but he liked keeping himself groomed, it showed off the lines of his muscles better. The trimmed chest hairs spread across his pectorals and around his nipples. At eighteen, he knew his pelt hadn&#39;t completely filled in, he was hoping it would cover his entire chest eventually, stopping short of his shoulders. Turning as he went through a few more poses he even saw a light coating of fur on his muscular ass cheeks, and only the faintest dusting at the base of his spine. Still, he knew he was one of the hairier guys in his class, he had seen most of them naked in the locker room after all. Not the hairiest, but top 5 at least, though his had started growing young and more than once he had fantasized about one of his jock class mates with a thicker pelt. Hairy, and short, when he was a lanky freshman he had gotten the nickname Chimp. It pissed him off enough that he joined the wrestling team and started lifting weights. Then, with his muscular and hirsute he had had the nickname Gorilla since sophomore year. He loved it, though most shortened it to Gor, now.<br />
<br />
Memories of wrestling matches in gyms all over came rushing back. People chanting his nickname as he pinned a guy for the win. Details of his workout routine. Study sessions for his senior classes, lessons Chris had never had. Fucking his last ex.<br />
<br />
More memories were coming, faster than he could do more than just consider them. Chris could remembering being himself, but he could also remember being Shane now, and Shane&#39;s memories and personality seemed to be pushing Chris&#39; back. They weren&#39;t two people, there was just one person in his head, but shy, nerdy, sophomore Chris was a memory and the confident, outgoing, senior Shane was in his place. As if accepting that was a signal, a last brief swelling of his muscles set in leaving him panting.. and horny. When he had let his thoughts wander to his class mates in the locker room his cock had begun to stir, chubbing up more as he remembered actually using it, and like the rest of him, thick and powerful.<br />
<br />
He grabbed it in one hand, unable to completely wrap his fingers around it and braced himself on the wall with his other hand. Luke Peters. That&#39;s who he started thinking about. Slowly he stroked himself, back and forth, his head sliding free of his foreskin, hot and red. Not a classmate, a coworker at his job at the fast food joint. His stroking sped up. A couple of years older than Shane, definitely taller, but Shane still had a good thirty pound on him, still fit though, and if the peek of his chest he&#39;d seen through the unbuttoned top of his polo is any indication he had a nice pelt of hair he could run his fingers through. Pre dribbled from the head of his cock onto the floor in a steady stream. He imagined Luke, bent over, fuzzy cheeks spread wide on his thick cock, begging for more. Heat flooded through him and he came, growling under his breath as he splattered the mirror and his floor with thick ropy gushes of his cum. It had never felt like that before said Chris memories, it was better hilted in a hot guy&#39;s ass retorted Shane&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his discarded underwear and cleaned up the mess he made, only now noticing the room had changed. The mirror was positioned by workout equipment. Trophies and medals decorated another corner. Different computer and different desk, though the Cronivac was flashing &#39;Changes Complete&#39; on the screen. The size of the room was even a bit bigger, windows and door in different places. His whole life was now different, and he was thrilled. A knock on the door broke him out of his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to be late for school.&quot; His mother&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll be ready in a second.&quot; It was the first time he had actually heard his voice as Shane. It was soft, but deep, but he knew he could bellow if he wanted. There was no response, he didn&#39;t expect there to be one. She usually came along a few minutes before he needed to go. Quickly he got dressed, running on autopilot. Shane knew what he needed, he tugged on jeans and a tee shirt, the clothes in this room where his so of course they fit. Grabbed his back pack and his duffel bag of wrestling gear for practice that afternoon. He knew his way through the house and grabbed his keys and wallet off the table by the door stopping only when he heard his mother&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgetting something?&quot; He turned to her, his father was a big bear of a man, and Shane took mostly after him, his mother was a petite doll of a woman, and the only thing he got from her was unfortunately his height... and perhaps her taste in men. She was holding out his freshly laundered wrestling singlet and his work polo towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, thanks mom.&quot; He took those and gave her a kiss on the cheek before tucking them in his duffel. Then his cell vibrated in his pocket and he pulled it out to be greeted with the alert: &#39;Thank you for downloading Chronivac mobile edition,&#39; along with a new icon on his screen. He smiled, then stepped out into the cool spring air and towards the large black pickup he knew was his, excited to see where his first day as Shane the Gorilla Walters would take him..</p>
