<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben had returned to the kitchen, dried from his shower and wearing a completely new change of clothes by 6:20.<br />
He noticed on his way in that his mothers had set the table for him while he was gone, but said he could handle the rest himself as he started checking everything and making the final preparations to serve.<br />
With that, Samantha and Frances Twist went into the other half of the house, just as they heard the front doorbell ring.<br />
<i>A bit early,</i> observed Samantha, as they went to answer the door.<br />
&quot;Greetings Mrs. Twist, Mrs. Twist,&quot; said the woman before them, holding out her hand to shake theirs. &quot;My name is Kenya Adaeze. Thank you for having me over for dinner.&quot;<br />
Their guest was a striking beauty over six feet tall, with exotic mocha skin, piercing hazel eyes, and silky black hair that cascaded slightly below her shoulders. Every muscle of her body visible outside the sleeveless gold dress she wore was sleek and toned. Samantha couldn&#39;t help noticing the moped in the driveway, parked so it could easily leave, with two helmets attached to the seat and a personalized Washington state license plate that said Z.FLUX.<br />
&quot;Hello. I&#39;m Frances, and this is Samantha,&quot; she said, completing the introductions. &quot;Won&#39;t you come in?&quot;<br />
&quot;You have a lovely home,&quot; said Kenya, looking around as she entered. Then she turned to face the Twists again. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not out of line. Benjamin said it was unnecessary, but I would be remiss in my obligations as a guest not to bring something with me on my first formal visit,&quot; she added, while reaching inside the small purse that matched her dress. &quot;My aunt is a professional botanist. She helps supply the florist in town and hopes to acquire ownership of it someday. These are from her personal hothouse. African violet seeds,&quot; she explained, pulling out a small envelope. &quot;We walked around to the backyard to talk the last time I was here, because whichever one of you was home at the time was taking a nap.&quot;*<br />
&quot;That was probably me,&quot; realized Frances, accepting the gift.<br />
&quot;Anyway, I noticed your plants and thought these would make a fine addition to your collection. The starting instructions are inside too, along with the web address for my aunt&#39;s botany blog for further details.&quot;<br />
&quot;How nice. Won&#39;t you sit down,&quot; requested Samantha, as Frances sat across from Kenya on the couch, while Samantha took the nearby guest chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can see by the way you look at me, this might be an awkward situation for the three of us, and—&quot; began Kenya, when Ben walked into the room.<br />
&quot;Hello Kenya. How&#39;re you doing?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Fine, so far. I have just met your mothers,&quot; she replied.<br />
&quot;Oh. Dinner will be ready in about 15 minutes. Can I get anyone anything?&quot; Ben asked.<br />
All three ladies said no. Ben was about to leave, when Kenya said, &quot;Perhaps you should stay, if you can. What I am about to say affects you as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; agreed Ben, pulling out one of the dining room table chairs and turning it around to face everyone before he sat down.<br />
&quot;Now then, as I was saying. I know this might be an awkward situation. Benjamin is sixteen and a junior in high school. I am 22 and a junior in college, majoring in business. The reason I requested the opportunity to meet you is to ask for your blessings in pursuing a relationship with your son. I have only met him recently, but Benjamin has fast acquired a place within my heart, and I would like to see where that leads us,&quot; admitted Kenya.<br />
<i>Well, she&#39;s refreshingly honest,</i> thought Frances, as she asked, &quot;How did you two meet?&quot;<br />
&quot;We stumbled across each other in the woods and struck up a friendship. Over the short time we have known each other, it has grown, leading me to this meeting,&quot; explained Kenya.<br />
&quot;If I remember correctly, you came to Moon Lake over the summer from New York,&quot; began Samantha. &quot;What brought you here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Greyhound,&quot; said Kenya with a smile, to which Ben laughed.<br />
<br />
Then Kenya turned her attention back to the elder Twists and said, &quot;I was originally born and raised in New York City, to a loving were couple, the first of two children in that family. I still have a younger sister back there, but she is just starting high school this year. Our ancestry is a strong were-panther/were-leopard mix. In my case, I physically become the pathress, but there is still a light trace of the leopard&#39;s markings in my fur. Anyway, the were population is much smaller in New York and not as organized as here. The individual species look out for each other, and we all try to protect the collective whole, but the city is full of much danger, even for normal humans. My folks thought I would be better off in Moon Lake, to at least finish my education if nothing else, and sent me here over the summer to live with my aunt and uncle.&quot;<br />
<i>OH NO! Does that mean Kenya leaves when she graduates?</i> feared Ben.<br />
&quot;What are your plans after graduation?&quot; asked Frances, as if she read Ben&#39;s mind.<br />
&quot;In truth, I am uncertain of the future at this moment,&quot; conceded Kenya. &quot;I will still have a year of studies left after completing this one next Spring. I have applied for a summer internship at Tachibana Enterprises, but the deadline has yet to pass for applicants filing before they start the review process. Meanwhile, I have rapidly grown to appreciate Moon Lake&#39;s natural beauty, along with the quiet, laid back approach to life here, as well as the mutual protection and friendship between weres and normals Moon Lake has developed.  Provided I can find a long term job here after graduating college, I could easily find myself wanting to permanently stay in Moon Lake, depending upon how a personal matter turns out,&quot; she added, turning to give Ben a brief smile.<br />
<br />
Ben smiled back at Kenya, as much in happiness about what she said in regards to them as relief that she might stay forever. <i>With me!</i><br />
&quot;Just what kind of relationship were you hoping to pursue with our son?&quot; asked Samantha bluntly.<br />
Kenya turned to face Samantha directly and said, &quot;If the fates are kind and things work out between us, <i>very</i> long term, with your blessings.&quot;<br />
&quot;If I can ask, have the two of you... that is—&quot; began Frances. As a professional therapist, she had no problem asking this type of question of others, but considering they were discussing her own son...<br />
&quot;No. Not yet,&quot; quickly answered Kenya. &quot;I did check with the college&#39;s legal department today. Since we both are beyond the minimum legal age for consenting weres, it would not be illegal for us to explore the physical aspects of any potential relationship. However, even considering the greater activity of a were libido, I have always felt that sex is something that must develop naturally between two beings. I have been and will continue to take the were birth control pill for panthers until such time as myself and whoever my husband turns out to be are ready and willingly to bring a child into this world.&quot;<br />
Frances actually smiled at that while Ben thought... <i>Geez. Mrs. Kenya Twist. If it&#39;s meant to be, it does have a nice ring to it.</i><br />
&quot;And if we give you our blessings to pursue a relationship and it does eventually lead to marriage, what then?&quot; asked Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;While this is not something I have discussed with Benjamin yet, since it is still far too soon,&quot; began Kenya, &quot;if and when the time comes; it will be after he turns 18, has graduated high school, and we both know what lies within the future besides ourselves.&quot;<br />
Before anyone could say something else, a timer &#39;dinged&#39; in the kitchen.<br />
&quot;The biscuits are done. I&#39;ll be serving dinner momentarily,&quot; said Ben, before going into the kitchen.<br />
&quot;Is there someplace I can wash up for dinner?&quot; asked Kenya.<br />
Frances gave their guest directions to the hall bathroom.<br />
After Kenya left, Frances turned to her wife and asked, &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;<br />
&quot;She does have a good head on her shoulders,&quot; admitted Samantha. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s just because it&#39;s Ben we&#39;re talking about, but despite both of them being weres, I still have some reservation concerning the age gap.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can appreciate that,&quot; said Frances, in her professional therapist tone of voice. &quot;But if it wasn&#39;t Ben, would you give them your blessing to pursue a relationship?&quot;<br />
Samantha gave serious thought to the question before giving Frances her answer. The two of them agreed on the decision without further discussion, and decided to announce that decision during dinner.<br />
