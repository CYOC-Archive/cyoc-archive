<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gazing around the Moreland home, Marisa MacGregor certainly felt out of her element. Wizards, demon hunters, witches, succubus, imps, werewolves, and a kitsune. For the 150 year old vampire it was certainly, different.<br />
<br />
Marisa had simply run to her daughter and friends aid, dispatching a pair of vampires bent on kidnapping children. Marisa had done this on several occasions, as a amateur vampire hunter she had handled her own kind on more than one occasion. What she hadn&#39;t expected was being thrown into a battle involving all manners of the supernatural.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marisa paused, glancing over at her daughter. She was a little perturbed that Nat and Rei hadn&#39;t mentioned this earlier. After leaving the vampire nation she had tried to keep a low profile. Miro didn&#39;t have a reputation for being a forgiving vampire, even if Mark herself was born a vampire and not turned like so many others. She, like Miro, was a natural vampire, having no master. It placed her in vampire high society yet she, like her parents, were not as blood thirsty as other vampires. It was what finally made her flee and marked her as a traitor. &quot;I&#39;m fine Nat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t look fine,&quot; Nat stated. &quot;You kinda look like I do whenever I have to speak in public.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right Mrs. MacGregor,&quot; Rei added. &quot;I&#39;ve seen Nat look like that before. If it helps, just picture everyone in their underwear.&quot; Marisa now turned her head slowly, raising an eyebrow at Rei. As much as she liked Nat&#39;s girlfriend, the girl could be quite odd. &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind Rei.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, Marisa now studied everyone carefully. From what she could gather it appeared the Moreland family was friendly with the wizards. Two blond girls who appeared to be sisters now talked with Jacob Moreland, Marisa surprised to see the infamous hunter had been gravely injured. In his stead, it appeared his eldest son had taken over the family duties. The teenage boy though appeared to have had a rough night as a doctor now tended to a pair of bullet wounds. <br />
<br />
As the wizards and Morelands talked, Marisa could see the kitsune brooding along with a child witch, imp, succubus, and werewolf. Marisa was well aware of succubus and imps, having dispatched of their numbers in the past. What struck her as odd is that these demons seemed to be acting as caretakers for the witch and werewolf. <br />
<br />
Having grown up in the supernatural world, Marisa was well aware that different families rarely, if ever, mixed. Werewolves were immense proud, demons rarely cared for showed interest in humanity except for their own purposes, and kitsune were so rare that Marisa believed them to be myth. This group though appeared to have allied themselves with wizards and were even protective of a witch. Marisa had to know what was going on. &quot;Girls stay here I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Approaching the succubus and kitsune, Marisa was puzzled as she looked at them. It shocked her that the demon and the kitsune were an actual couple. A succubus being in a relationship with anyone seemed as likely as a Yeti with a small shor size. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she now said.<br />
<br />
Akira turned, Ayami holding his hand as they gazed at the vampire. Akira knew of vampires but had rarely had contact with them. This vampire appeared to be a very attractive middle aged woman with auburn hair and a fit body. &quot;You&#39;re the vampire,&quot; Akira said softly. &quot;Marisa correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marisa nodded, still unsure of Akiras intentions. She was now surprised as he gave the vampire a slight bow. &quot;My name is Akira,&quot; he stated. &quot;I thank you Marisa, I  have heard of your actions in defending the Harris children. Kari. Aaron, and Haley are of great importance to the clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The clan,&quot; Marisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those children are connected to Lord Tatsu and Lady Shizen,&quot; Akira replied. &quot;The eldest is the daughter of our leaders, adopted by the Harris women while the twins are their first grandchildren. Our clan is in your debt for your actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marisa&#39;s head was spinning, she had no idea. She now robotically offered thanks before continuing. &quot;I&#39;m still trying to gather my bearings,&quot; she said. &quot;My daughter and her friend hadn&#39;t mentioned any of this. I&#39;m curious about, well everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira here kind of the guardian of the next generation,&quot; Ayami stated. &quot;When Merlin got arrested his daughter talked a lawyer friend we know named Franklin. After that we figured something was up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately we were too late,&quot; Akira scowled. &quot;Yuriko was taken as well as Lynne. I wish to mount a rescue as quickly as possible but the wizards believe a plan is in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to get Yuki back,&quot; Mia now exclaimed, the young witchling joining Akira and Ayami. Marisa now casting the girl a dubious look. &quot;I don&#39;t know how comfortable I am having children charge headlong into battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m thirteen,&quot; Mia grumbled, folding her arms across her chest. &quot;And so is Zack. I don&#39;t see you telling him he shouldn&#39;t go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The werewolf is only 13,&quot; Marisa exclaimed. The vampire now gawked at the large Lycan. Despite being barely a teenager, he was as large as some full grown werewolves. &quot;Everything about this is peculiar,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Teenage witches and werewolves, a succubus with a boyfriend? Wizards and demon hunters making battle plans? Ive never seen anything like this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah its a motley crew,&quot; Rexie stated, the imp familiar sitting before her master. The black cats eyes carefully studying the vampire. &quot;I&#39;ll give you the crib notes version. Akira and Ayami are dating,, Ayami protects Zack, I&#39;m Mia&#39;s familiar, and those kids are Yuki&#39;s godparents. So, what&#39;s your story?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marisa now gestured towards her daughter, Nat and Rei idly talking amongst themselves. &quot;My daughter and her friend were attacked,&quot; she said. &quot;I came to her aid and then found myself here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira now rubbed his chin, carefully studying the two teens. &quot;Neither girl is a warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct,&quot; Marisa replied. &quot;And they&#39;re too young. Which is why I think it would be best if Mia and Zack stayed behind. My people won&#39;t show them mercy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia and Zack have faced far worse than vampires,&quot; Akira said solemnly. &quot;I do ask a favor though. Protect the other children while we rescue the others. In return, I shall grant any request.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small grin now spread across Marisas face as she gazed at the kitsune, she had the perfect idea. &quot;I&#39;ll do it Akira,&quot; she said. &quot;But when its over I want to sit down and hear your story. I have a feeling it could be...quite interesting.&quot;</p>
