<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny returned to the kitchen, finding that her mother had not only finished eating her breakfast of chocolate pancakes and bacon, but was already preparing a second helping for herself at the stovetop! The wobbling globe of a woman hummed merrily to herself as she flipped another sugary flapjack, her face and hands still coated in chocolate syrup and grease from her first helping.<br />
<br />
“Mom, are you,” Jenny cried, “are you really making more food like that?! Without washing your hands?”<br />
<br />
“Without washing my…” Carol realized before belly laughing, causing her flabby rolls to jiggle and slosh, “Oh, I’m sorry dear! Guess I got a little overzealous about fixing up seconds for myself. I really should have washed, huh? Especially since I eat with my hands. Oh well, I was going to take a pressure wash after breakfast anyhow. Anyway, are you sure you’re doing okay, honey bunch-a oats? You barely touched your salad. You’re not feeling sick are you? Besides that malnutrition I mean?”<br />
<br />
“Sick?” Jenny was taken aback, “Me? I’m doing fine! It’s this food that’s sick! Look at me! I only had like three bites of the salad and suddenly put on like ten pounds! Seriously, how can veggies be fattening?!”<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s just your body responding to finally getting some nutrients in it,” Carol insisted with a smile, “I’d actually be terrified if you didn’t gain anything from eating. I told you we’d bulk you back up to a healthy weight, didn’t I? Now please finish eating up before your salad starts wilting, it’d be such a waste of good food.”<br />
<br />
“Mom! Do you seriously not hear how ridiculous you sound?!” Jenny shouted, “How can you expect me to believe that people are supposed to be-“ She was suddenly cut off by a violent growl coming from her stomach. She felt woozy and shaky, as though she hadn’t had anything to eat except water for three days straight. “Oh… oh god… I… I actually feel like… like I’m st… st… STARVING?!?!”<br />
<br />
“Well I should think so,” Carol continued as she brought her second towering plate of chocolate pancakes and bacon to the table, “Just look at you, all skin and bones! You know what to do to stop feeling so hungry?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes,” Jenny clambered back into her chair at the table, “Yes Mom, I know what to do.” She picked her fork back up and was about to take another bite, but then she stopped before she could spear another leaf. She stared at her fork for a few moments, considering how completely hungry she felt… how three mere bites already made her gain so much weight… how much her insides were starting to hurt from how hungry she was… so very… very… hungry… She whipped around and threw her fork into the wall, embedding the tines right into the plaster. “TO HELL WITH FORKS!!! I’M DYING HERE!” she shrieked as she started cramming an entire fistful of her salad into her mouth. Her outburst actually shocked Carol away from her half eaten meal for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Jennifer dear?” Carol squeaked, “Are you sure you’re okay?”<br />
<br />
“Does it look like I’m okay?!” Jenny shouted through a mouthful of chewed up lettuce and tomato, “I’m starving here! Just let me eat!”<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Carol blinked, “Oh my! Well by all means, eat! Gosh, I haven’t seen your appetite this high since you started going through puberty and forced yourself to… well that doesn’t matter right now, does it? My baby’s finally eating again!”<br />
<br />
Jennifer was currently lost in a heady frenzy and didn’t quite catch what her mother was saying. Not that anything quite mattered to her while she was this hungry. She was too busy shoveling handfuls of dressing slathered leaves into her mouth like a wild animal to pay attention. With every swallow, every bite, Jennifer could feel her body blowing up centimeter by centimeter… then inch by inch… the pounds piling on like she was a growing water balloon. With every new inch of flesh she could feel her own skin starting to tear and stretch, and her clothes getting tighter and tighter, eventually tearing at the seams. Even then she didn’t seem to care. She had to keep eating until her body couldn’t handle another bite. She felt so empty, and so suddenly… could this be another effect of this strange new world?<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until she got to the bottom of her salad bowl that Jenny stopped eating. Right on cue, too, because by then her stomach was finally starting to feel… satisfied. Not too full, but nowhere near not full enough. Just the right amount of food in her belly. Satisfied. So satisfied that she could start thinking a bit more rationally again.<br />
<br />
“HOLY SHIT WHAT DID I DO?!” she shrieked as she looked down at her body. First of all… good grief she was naked! Her clothes were nothing more than torn up tattered around her feet, ripped up at the seams by her fattening body. Speaking of which, her body had suddenly turned into a fleshy pillow streaked with stretch marks. Her stomach had bloated up to the size of a beach ball and seemed to jiggle like jelly when she poked at it. Her breasts had gone up a few cup sizes, going from perky little C-cups to big and floppy F-cups. She patted at her butt, it felt like she was smuggling a pair of squishy basketballs in her cheeks. No doubt her thighs were swollen up like a pair of Christmas hams to match.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she felt a growing pressure in her bowels, and heard an unsettling gurgling. Before she could react, her butt autonomously pushed out a massive fart and didn’t stop for a solid five seconds. Her face went violently red. She could smell it… it smelled like her salad.<br />
<br />
Carol couldn’t help but chuckle warmly. “I can’t remember the last time you actually cleaned your plate, Jenny!” she praised, “Oh my baby, I’m so proud of you! And look at you! You’re starting to look healthier again. It won’t be long until you’re as big as everyone else!”<br />
<br />
“Buh… muh… guh…” Jenny babbled as she climbed down from her chair and started pacing around the kitchen, “My… my uniform, it… my uniform is dead… my uniform is dead, the coach is gonna kill me… I’m gonna get kicked off the squad… I can’t get kicked off the squad! I’m Captain! Captain can’t get kicked off! I worked so hard to be Captain! Oh god… oh god what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do, I can’t face coach like this! I killed my uniform, coach is gonna kill me… no… no no no this can’t be happening! I can’t die! I can’t die like this! What did I do to deserve this?”<br />
<br />
She paused in her rambling to stare at her body. Could she even call it her body anymore? In the space of like half an hour she’d gone from a perfectly toned and sculpted size into a walking sack of mashed potatoes. All she did was eat a salad! Even if it was a two or three gallon salad and drenched in an entire bottle of ranch dressing, she shouldn’t have gotten this fat from a freaking salad! It was a pile of lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and spinach! Vegetables! That’s it! Seriously, how can veggies be fattening?!<br />
<br />
“Oh I’m sure Coach Grady isn’t going to kick you off the squad,” Carol assured as she waddled over to her daughter, “No idea why she let you join the team as such a twig anyway, let alone made you captain, but I don’t think a little accident like this is going to make her kick you off the team. Actually I bet she would be happy to see you finally looking a little more nourished. I’m sure she would forgive you ripping up your uniform because of that.”<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Jennifer choked, “Look at me! I’m so huge… huger than huge… I’m so… I shouldn’t be this fat! You shouldn’t be this fat! NO ONE should be this fat! I’m… I’m such a freak!” She suddenly collapsed to her knees and started crying into her pudgy hands.<br />
<br />
“Oh honey,” Carol gasped, “How could you say that about me? About yourself?! Oh my sweetcake, my little honey dumpling! Come here, everything is going to be okay.” She pulled her daughter into a tight, squishy hug, nearly drowning the crying girl in her massive sweaty body. Jenny suddenly stopped sobbing.<br />
<br />
“Mmmph!” she shouted, muffled my the flab she was surrounded in, “Mom! Mom, let go! You’re gonna suffocate me!” Carol quickly let the girl go to catch her breath, seemingly suddenly over her crying fit.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry,” her mother cried, “I just… you were crying, and… you were saying such horrible things about yourself. I was trying to make you feel better, not suffocate you to death! Oh honey, can you forgive me?” Jenny looked up at the wobbly eyes of the gigantic fat parody of her mother. She genuinely did seem worried about her, in her strange corrupted way. Jenny sighed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess I forgive you,” Jenny replied, “I’m sorry I said you shouldn’t be this fat. It’s uh… it seems pretty clear you think weighing a thousand pounds is supposed to be healthy, and I guess you aren’t struggling to do stuff like that, so… maaaaybe I’ll give it a try?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’m actually closer to about two thousand pounds,” Carol clarified, “but I understand what you mean… I think. Nothing would make me happier than helping you get back up to a healthy weight! Heck, you might actually get taller too! Hopefully you’ll be about nine feet tall and about fifteen hundred pounds heavier by the end of the semester if we’re dedicated.”<br />
<br />
“That’s uh,” Jennifer had to stop herself from protesting and considered her next words carefully, “That sounds alright.” She suddenly let out a hard, sharp fart and groaned from embarrassment. “God, why am I having so much trouble holding my farts?”<br />
<br />
Carol let off a massive foghorn toot that shook the walls. “Silly Jenny,” she giggled, “you hold in your poops, not your toots! People are supposed to fart all the time.”<br />
<br />
“S-suuuure,” Jenny said halfheartedly.<br />
<br />
“How about I call the school and say you can’t come in today?” Carol suggested, “Probably not the best idea if you can’t fit into your clothes anymore, huh? Then we can wash up and I can take you shopping for better fits and then some. A little mother daughter time might do us good anyway. Between you going to school and cheer practice, and me spending so much time in the office, we haven’t had much time to ourselves.” Carol was waddling towards her bathroom to take a shower and change out of her track clothes, leaving Jenny to her thoughts.<br />
<br />
“God, what am I thinking?!” She asked herself panickedly, “Am I going native already?! I don’t wanna be a nine foot tall fatass! I want my own life back!” She took a deep breath through her nose, face pointed straight at the ceiling. She dropped her head as she let her breath out. “You know what? Minor setback. I can deal with this. All I have to do is get my hands on that little dipshit and make him turn the world back to normal. God, this place has gotta be like some kind of sexual fetish or something. It’s all so… specific. Sheesh, and all over pulling his pants down in the hallway. Jerk. I’m gonna make him pay for this!”</p>
