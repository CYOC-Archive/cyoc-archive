<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan eagerly wanted to serve her husband but before she would do that. She wanted to tease her husband’s second wife and her personal dildo collection cleaning lady maid Martha with her fluffy tail. Susan quickly whisked her vixen tail in Martha’s nose and then pushed her tongue out playfully to signal Martha what she was missing out on. Susan smiled with a grin reaching on her cheeks as she knew that Martha’s other mundane chores awaited for their humble and horny cleaner. Susan had nothing to worry that another woman would steal her husband. She then turned back on her husband but something unexpected happened.<br />
<br />
Susan hadn’t prepared herself mentally when her husband grabbed her vixen wrists and slammed back of her head on to the floor as her wolf husband pinned her down. Johnny’s aggressive feral side was finally kicking in. Johnny’s fangs were fully visible and his tight grip with his strong bicep muscles made sure that Susan couldn’t escape from her fate. Susan felt a little bit of fear in her stomach but it soon turned into excitement as the wolf man pushed the tip of his cock in her small slit. The sexual tension was building high as Susan could smell Johnny’s warm breath directly on her fox nose. Johnny’s lips dripped big chunks of saliva on to Susan’s face.<br />
<br />
Susan saw how her wolf husband’s eyes trashed in his sockets until his both sclera became red as crimson with the black small dots as his pupils. Susan remembered that like werewolves, Johnny was able to awaken his more sexually deviant and aggressive feral side in him with a snap of a finger. All he needed was a good fuck and the body handled the rest. Johnny groaned as the transformation was distorting and bulking his already big body. Susan’s heart beat faster as it reminded her of their first time in bed. It was as thrilling as it was back then. Johnny’s fangs got even sharper and pointier as he showed their growth to Susan, like a hunter showing his knife to it’s prey. Johnny’s dagger like teeth could have easily penetrated Susan’s fluffy neck in a second. Johnny looked unpredictable, and his feral eyes were locked on his wife’s voluptuous mature body as if she was his dinner ready to be gobbled down his throat. Johnny lolled his tongue out as it bopped up and down in front of Susan. His tongue was even longer than Susan’s anthropomorphic fox tongue and suddenly, the tongue lunged itself like a spear inside Susan’s mouth and went deep down her throat the moment she less expected it. <br />
<br />
Susan’s mouth made loud squelching noises as the tongue moved inside her throat. Susan couldn’t hold herself together and opened her floodgates down at her crotch. A small ejaculation exited her vixen pussy. Susan gasped and moaned as the gunpowder filled rocket flew in her fantasy land’s sky and exploded in to a beautiful red and green palm tree. Her husband’s wolf penis wasn’t even inside her slit. They were only kissing and that had made her orgasm. Susan was mad at herself for having such a sensitive body. She wanted to savor the feeling longer but the sudden dominant tongue action had surprised her. Susan’s little fox heart sounded like a car engine beating it’s pistons at high speed. Susan could only breathe with her little vixen nostrils as the big wolf tongue moved inside her throat like a pole dancer. <br />
<br />
Susan looked at her husband’s dominant eyes and wanted to look away from him but couldn’t. She felt more relaxed as she kept staring at them. Her husband’s two small black dot sized pupils were two tiny black holes that sucked everything on their path. Susan felt how her fear and worries were disappearing and melting away. Susan felt more confident when she stared at her husband’s eyes. Those eyes took away every negative thought she had in her mind and left Susan with only positive thoughts. It made her feel safe. The fear factor she felt inside her for a moment was part of their power play. His dominance wasn’t an act, Susan saw the truth, Johnny was a living embodiment of ‘I do what I want and I take what I want’ mentality. He wasn’t faking his raw emotions, wants or needs and he didn’t look or feel insecure. It looked as if he loved when his submissive wife acted all surprised and intimidated. <br />
<br />
His crimson eyes, black pupils, sharp white teeth and spear like tongue were shaking Susan’s nerves, yes, but in a good way. Her husband’s feral gaze, javelin like tongue and massive muscular fur covered body hypnotized Susan into more submissive, yet safe, trance. She knew that she didn’t have to feel embarrassed for what she had done earlier when they kissed. Susan acted a little bit like her husband but in an opposite way. She was proud of her submissive nature. She never felt fear when she was near her husband and she had only confused her anticipation and excitement for it. Susan wanted to enter into her submissive heaven. A place where she could be the most overused and loved cock sleeve to her husband. But Susan lamented how it was impossible at this point. Her mind wasn’t hitting those same high notes how she did way back in her college days. Susan remembered that it was when she first met Johnny, it was love at first sight for both of them, and then she got pregnant with their anthropomorphic wolf-fox hybrid daughter, Jennifer, on the same day when they met. It all happened so fast, but both were so horny and full of sexual energy, that it just happened. It felt like two sexually charged electric magnets were slammed together that night. Everybody at the campus remembers that night as the whole building swung when Johnny transformed into his werewolf self. But that was before Jennifer was born and the sex after her college days never felt so exciting as it did. Johnny’s wolf man body, even in his werewolf state, couldn’t go beyond his physical limits as a ‘man’. He would had to evolve, or devolve, in to something else in order to Susan to hit those orgasmic highs again as she did when she had lost her virginity.<br />
<br />
Then as the sex continued the TV’s static noise on the background hissed and snapped as the images on the screen flickered. The black and white static sound distorted and vibrated in the background and soon the images on the TV’s documentary looked different. The average sized wolf shook violently as it’s body size grew bigger. The announcer explained how many moons ago their anthropomorphic offspring wandered the deserts and forests with their other advanced humanoid species. Human, Fauxman and Wolffan had all evolved in similar way but shared completely different ancestry. <br />
<br />
Johnny pulled his tongue out of Susan’s mouth and howled as his body hair grew bigger. Every small strand of hair got more luscious volume. Johnny’s feral howl got lower and his vocal chords begun to hit those brassy D-flats. The booming sound vibrated every corner of the house like an air horn. Susan saw how her husband’s claws got larger in size and one claw could have been as long or even longer than Susan’s pinkie finger. Johnny’s already lean and muscular shape got more buffed and bulkier. The feral were-wolf man on top of her begun to look intimidating. Susan turned her head to see Martha’s reaction and saw how to the wolf girl had hid behind the corner and couldn’t make eye contact with her husband.<br />
<br />
Susan remembered two memories that she had forgotten. First was the day when she had met Johnny. He was a well educated man when he was on his first stage which he called ‘anthro-mode’. Second ‘mode’, which he called ‘werewolf mode’ was unique to his species. He had explained to Susan that when he released his wolf hormones to his body. This made him became more feral and lose the ability to form normal sentences and had to communicate with very simple words. The last one. That was staring at Susan’s face was the so called ‘last mode’. The most hungriest, nastiest and animalistic side of his species. Johnny’s full feral mode made his ancestral blood boil and turned him into a massive animal that only growled and howled like a beast. He had explained that he had no real control over his body. He moved with an instinct alone, like an animal would.<br />
<br />
Susan’s second memory was when Johnny had once explained to her that he had never used his ‘third mode’ and it only activated by accident or in odd cases when he ‘wanted to mate really badly’ or ‘protect his den and property’. It was like the fight or flight emotion, but amplified to it’s absolute limit. Johnny’s ‘last mode’ had happened once before and it was the day when Susan had lost her virginity to Johnny and she was impregnated with his seed. The sex that day was pure animalistic lust. Susan couldn’t remember anything from that day. She could only recall that the sex lasted for hours and that it felt really good.<br />
<br />
If Susan was a regular human sized anthropomorphic fox girl, the wolf on top of her was now twice or maybe thrice as big as she was. The size of her dire wolf husband made Susan audibly swallow. It meant that his anthropomorphic dire wolf cock was heading towards her tiny slit. Susan remembered from last time how that night ended up in her passing out but she couldn’t remember why. Susan had no idea what would happen to her body and mind when that massive feral pole was pushed inside her. Susan didn’t have to wait for long as Johnny howled and growled like a feral dire wolf and begun to slide the thing inside her.<br />
<br />
Immediately Susan’s eyes teared up as the wolf’s cock stretched her insides. There was no pain but she could definitely feel it when the whole girthy object streched her vixen walls. It felt as if she was unbirthing her husband’s cock as it invited itself past her vagina’s front door and went past it’s lips. Susan had to think about her breathing as the thing felt so massive. Her husband’s cock size was huge with a big H. There was nothing like it. Susan’s forehead begun to sweat profusely, her eyes begun to wander all over the room, the walls of her pussy were stretched wide. The massive tip made a foot sized bulge in her stomach and it wasn’t fully inside her. Susan’s insides were compressed by it’s length and girth.<br />
<br />
Then it begun. The wall had been hit.<br />
<br />
Johnny made his first pull and second push. Susan winced, gritted her fangs and an let out the horniest and the most animalistic moan she could ever let out from her salivating lips. It felt amazing when the huge cock begun to swing in it’s rhythm. Susan’s body jolted every time it was pushed and pulled inside her. Her body twitched, and she experienced a feeling that she could only explain as the bass drum’s beater hitting her vulva with a force enough to cause her an avalanche of orgasms.<br />
<br />
The big and round part of the drum’s beater bulged her stomach like a cartoon. The comically large member pulled and pushed her insides and the bulge that dented her stomach looked like a watermelon every time Johnny’s feral dire wolf cock reached it’s end and pushed Susan’s vixen fur upwards.<br />
<br />
The cock’s rhythm got faster and it made Susan move like a paper puppet on a string while Johnny’s front paws kept her in place. Susan couldn’t think straight anymore. Her mind was becoming incoherent mess. Susan’s uterus was treated like a Johnny’s dog toy. The dick’s prick was injecting her with an euphoric drug that made Susan’s brain chemistry go haywire. Every thrust into her pussy made Susan’s mouth produce saliva. The word liquid felt too dry to describe how moist Susan’s body was as it was beyond that. Susan’s eyes shot upwards as the powerful orgasms were violent and relentless. Susan could have sworn that she passed out from the initial shock but the orgasm had woken her up like a defibrillator. Every orgasm in her brain felt like a Zeus’s personal lightning bolt straight into her nervous system as at some point Susan felt nothing but an orgasmic bliss after another in rapid whip crackling motion.<br />
<br />
Johnny threw his tongue back inside his wife’s throat as she was trying her best to breathe. The tongue acted like a second slimy dick or a lenghty tentacle. Johnny was spit-roasting his wife from both ends. The scene was straight out of a horror show. The sweat, spit and other similar liquids gathered under Susan’s back. Her vixen fur was covered in all sorts of watery liquids and she loved it. Johnny pulled her tongue out and licked his wife’s furry snout multiple times and nibbled her neck like a hungry wolf. Her husband was gentle when it came to her neck. Susan knew how precious she was for her husband even if she was her husband’s favorite cock socket. Susan gasped and moaned when Johnny’s moved his hips faster.<br />
<br />
Susan didn’t remember when she had last time inhaled air to her lungs. She had to do it manually. Susan’s whole body was breaking apart from it’s natural automatic functions as the orgasms hit her so hard. They were so aggressive and hard that it felt like a truck had just rolled over her. The euphoric feeling made Susan experience hallucinations and out of body experiences as she could see herself getting fucked by Johnny from third person. It was as if she was watching herself from the TV getting fucked by her husband. Susan felt how Johnny was nearing his end and then it happened. A massive stream of wolf semen was released in to Susan’s vixen belly and it begun to grow like a water balloon that already looked like a big gym ball. Susan gave her penultimate spit released moan as her belly expanded rapidly. The small living room echoed with her belly produced leathery sounds as her gut got massive and went even beyond that. <br />
<br />
The last orgasm she felt was like a lightning storm. Every cell in her body orgasmed, screamed and exploded from bliss so hard that she felt Susan’s mind and her body was melting from the last orgasm she felt. The living room looked like a gray colored heaven on earth for a second. The time was slowing down. Susan had experienced so earth shattering orgasm that she had run out of words to describe them. The electricity in her brain moved faster than the world around her. It was like a magic spell or an unnatural orgasmic phenomenon that wrecked havoc in her perception. But that feeling only lasted for seconds. The last tick of that second felt like a week or two. Susan felt how her body was falling back on to the earth’s soil from her personal heaven. The whole room’s gray color got all white and then suddenly the lights on the living room went out and the room got pitch black.<br />
<br />
Then, the sensation stopped.<br />
<br />
Susan felt how her husband’s cock wasn’t inside her anymore. She woke up from the familiar floor with half of her face kissing the floor’s wooden panels as her body jolted back up on all fours. She was covered in sweat, saliva and she could feel how her stomach was full of semen. Susan felt dazed, thirsty and hungry for salt. She looked at her belly and gasped as her gut was so dented that she looked like if she was on her third semester with quadruplets. Susan had no idea how long she had laid on the floor. She looked around and saw that the living room was empty of it’s inhabitants and the only human-like voice came from the small busted radio on the half-broken plastic table. The voice in the radio described loving relationship between dire wolves and horny foxes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the front door creaked open.<br />
<br />
“Mom..? What happened here? How are you so small, and why are you covered in sweat. UGH! Why does our home smell like a public toilet? Mom!! You are also pregnant!?” A very tall anthropomorphic wolf-fox girl asked as she squatted in front of Susan. “Mom! How did this happen? What’s going on!? What did Kyle do to you?”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm-mmm, Jennifer? Is that you? I could… I could ask you the same question. Why are you... So tall and covered in fur..?” Susan asked from the girl as her body felt numb and exhausted. <br />
<br />
Susan tried to sit on the floor but her body was as soft as a bowl of gelatin in a hot sunny day which caused her to slam back on the floor on her back side.<br />
<br />
“How should I know! Everything happened so fast. I had no time to think and all of a sudden other students begun to treat me like a weird beast and then like, I don’t know. Everyone seemed to agree that I’ve always been this weird wolf-fox beast. Like seriously. The whole school day was a struggle from start to finish. So, care to explain why we both are covered in fur and how our house looks like a chicken coop?” Jennifer swayed her anthropomorphic back paws from side to side and tried to calm herself down by hugging herself with the upper wolf-fox paws.<br />
<br />
Susan looked at her daughter. She wanted to explain to Jennifer everything that she had experienced, but...</p>
