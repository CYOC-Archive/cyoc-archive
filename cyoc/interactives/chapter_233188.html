<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny shook the tears from her eyes with her goofy snail-like stalks. She ignored how second nature that instinct came to her as she scanned the room for her phone. She’d dropped it on the floor during her transformation and it seemed to have bounced a few feet away.<br />
<br />
Of course, Jenny was some kind of human-snail hybrid thing now, with no real arms or legs to speak of, just a broad, flat underbelly to crawl around on. If there was one thing she knew about snails, it’s that snails are really quite slow. Of course, she also knew that snails were pretty small, and she was probably a bit bigger than the average human being, let alone a snail. Surely she wouldn’t really be as slow as an actual snail, right?<br />
<br />
The only way to find out was to actually start making way to get her phone. Luckily it seemed that gastropod locomotion seemed to come second nature to her as well, and she glided across the floor with ease. Of course, she was on a carpeted floor in her room, and the feeling of the threads tickling her underside was… Well she wouldn’t call the feeling uncomfortable, but it was a bit like the shiver you get down your spine pulling a cotton ball apart. Not to mention the fact that her crotch was a part of her snail-like underbelly that the feeling of carpet threads brushing against her labia was absolutely sending tingles all over her body.<br />
<br />
There was also the significant issue of the obvious slime trail she was constantly secreting and leaving behind as she slithered forward. If the particulars of the curse were anything to go off of, then that slime would probably be mostly sweat. It left a dark stain as it soaked into the carpet though, and she did feel mild regret about it, but her family did have a full time maid working for them so she supposed it would be fine not to worry about it so much. Then again if she is just going to be leaving slime everywhere she’d better figure something out about it if she wants to keep going to school.<br />
<br />
Did she want to go to school like this? She figured that yes, she probably should if she wanted to have any hope of getting rid of her curse. Being a weirdo snail girl with a gigantic fat, wobbling ass would hopefully be nothing more than a brief setback. For now though, she should focus on getting her phone and calling for help.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for her to slither her way to her phone. Indeed she was practically greased lightning compared to the average garden snail, but it did still take her a minute to travel like five feet forward. Now came the question of how she was going to pick up the phone and dial someone for help. The first thing she tried was trying to grab it with her plumped up lips, but she found that she couldn’t really reach past her newly ballooned breasts. Her next idea worked a lot better as she squeezed her right eye shut and used her right eye stalk to pick her phone up, her skin being sticky enough to support its weight. Sure she could only see out of one eye now, but at least she had a way she could pick things up now. Of course there was no way she was gonna work the thing’s face scanner like this, so she literally had to dial in her password with her tongue. She licked open her contacts list and pondered about who she should call.<br />
<br />
Her first instinct was to phone Mom, but there was no chance in Hell Jennifer was gonna let her own mother see her like this. Martha was on her day off and usually had her phone turned off on those days, so she was a no go. The next people who she trusted were her squad members, but they probably wouldn’t be much help with getting rid of the curse, except for maybe Samantha. For a cheerleader, Sam was weirdly in to all that gothy, occult stuff, and didn’t she say her family descended from witches? Samantha it was then. So Jennifer tongued in Samantha’s number and brought the phone to where her ear would be.<br />
<br />
“Come on, pick up pick up pick up,” Jennifer mumbled into the dial tone. Would if she could tap her foot impatiently, but she found that she could clap her weird huge butt cheeks impatiently. The sooner she could get back to normal the better, but she had to admit that her new ass felt really… really nice. As soon as that thought crossed her mind she shook it away. She couldn’t allow this experience to alter her brain chemistry. Thankfully Sam finally picked up the phone.<br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Sam! Oh thank god,” Jennifer gasped.<br />
<br />
“Jenny, what’s going on?” Sam asked a bit cautiously, “Does this have anything to do with why you’re late to class today?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah yeah,” Jenny nodded, “Just… could you come help me out here? I’m having a… okay so you know that town curse rumor?” There was no answer on the other end of the line. “Hello?”<br />
<br />
“I’m on my way,” Samantha said quickly before hanging up. Jenny unstuck her phone from her eye and set it back on the ground.<br />
<br />
“Okay, help is on the way,” Jenny sighed with relief, “Sam knows where the spare key is. She’ll probably be able to help. Now I just need to wait for her. I suppose I could probably figure out how my new body works in the meantime.</p>
