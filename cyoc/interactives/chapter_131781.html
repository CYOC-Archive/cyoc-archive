<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We arrived at the hospital and walked to the intensive care unit. The duty nurse informed us that Sarah and Hilda were in the room with Rod. He was allowed visitors but only 2 at a time. We were ushered into a waiting room. Zach and Amanda were there. Zach was very upset. He had bought Hilda in. <br />
<br />
Zach introduced Amanda to us all. Amanda remembered Jenna from school. I pretended that I could remember her vaguely. I gathered Sarah had not told Zach who I really was. 10 minutes later Hilda and Sarah entered wearing hospital gowns and masks. I could see both had been crying. The nurse said two more of us could visit if we put on masks and gowns. Zach and Amanda had been here longer, the nurse accompanied them back to the room where Rod’s body was. <br />
<br />
Mum and Dad were comforting both Sarah and Hilda. Between sobs Sarah managed to get out that the doctors would keep Rod on life support but that if they could find no sign of brain activity within a few days the suggestion was that the life support should be turned off. A nurse had been in earlier to raise the subject of organ donation.<br />
<br />
I finally managed to give Sarah a hug. I whispered to her asking whether Zach knew who I was. All she said to me was “I haven’t told him” She knew I was stuck as Jenna for life. ”Oh Jenna, I’m so sorry”<br />
<br />
10 minutes later Zach and Amanda returned. It was Ted and Eileen’s turn to put on gowns and masks. They went off with the nurse. A hospital psychologist had joined us. He talked quietly to Sarah and then Hilda. Zach was upset, he said he had been allowed to touch Rod to say goodbye. It had no doubt been a shock to him see his own body of 25 years ruined and lifeless. <br />
<br />
Mum and Dad returned. Sarah said she would like to accompany me to see Rod. We put on masks and gowns. The nurse took us in to see the body. He was linked up to numerous beeping machines. Lifeless eyes were staring out from his unshaved face. What had for a short period been my face. I was allowed to touch the remaining hand. It was warm but there was no response. I said my goodbyes. I did not really know who I was saying farewell to. Not Rod my rapist, but Rod and the life I once had. I had to accept that I was now Jenna. The real Jenna was gone. Sarah was crying again and so was I. The nurse ushered us out of the room.<br />
<br />
We waited around the hospital for another 30 minutes. Monique and James arrived and had a turn of visiting Rod. Sarah and Hilda went with the psychologist into another room for a consultation. <br />
<br />
When they came out they said they had a lot to think about. Zach and Amanda took Hilda back home. We all returned to Mum and Dads.<br />
…..<br />
Sarah agreed to stay for dinner. But she said she needed to feed Biddy. Monique suggested she and I could go around and feed the dog. Sarah who was still occasionally sobbing agreed and handed me her house keys. James said he would stay and move their stuff into Monique’s old room. Mum had earlier made up Sarah’s room for them but Sarah was now going to stay the night.<br />
<br />
Monique drove me around to Sarah’s. I had to show her the way. It was the first time I had ever been alone with Monique. She lectured me in the car about it was time I grew up and stopped been such a bitch to Sarah. That Sarah was going to need a lot of support in the coming months. I guessed neither Sarah nor Mum had let her know that we had reconciled. I tried to reassure her that we were now getting on well. <br />
<br />
We arrived at Sarah’s and I introduced her to Biddy. He was his usual exuberant self. We walked him around the block then fed him and put him out the back. Monique mentioned she and James were had been thinking of getting a dog for themselves but in the end decided that it would hamper their travel plans.<br />
<br />
We returned to home, that was how I would have to think of the McKenzie’s from now on. Mum was in the kitchen cooking. She informed us that Sarah was having a rest. James was with Dad down in the shed. Monique stayed and helped Mum. I went and knocked on Sarah’s door. <br />
<br />
“Hello Sarah, are you awake”<br />
<br />
She opened the door and ushered me in, shutting the door again. We hugged each other. Eventually she said “I’ve been selfish just thinking how my future was robbed. It was our future, it must be very hard for you as well”<br />
<br />
I nodded “It was very hard to see my old body like that. Zach must have felt awful as well” <br />
<br />
“I didn’t get a chance to talk to him alone. I haven’t told him who you are. I’m not sure that we should”<br />
<br />
“Why is that?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t want to explain to him what happened in the end, how Jenna raped you”<br />
<br />
“I want him to know I’m still around. He was my best mate remember” <br />
<br />
“He can’t be any more. You are Jenna now. My sister. You can’t be a best mate anymore”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want any more lies. I just want to come clean. I think he will be glad to know I am still alive even if it is in this body. We don’t have to tell him everything that happened. Just that me and Jenna had swapped and then Jenna had the accident”<br />
<br />
“If you think so”<br />
<br />
“I do. If you get a chance, tell him we need to talk. We might be seeing a lot of him over the next few weeks”<br />
<br />
“I never rang you back this morning. Was it important?”<br />
<br />
“Not in light of your news. I just need help on how to be Jenna. I investigated some of Jenna’s emails and I don’t know for sure but I suspect she may have worked as a stripper. Do you know a friend of hers called Alison, Alison Banksville?” She shook her head. “She was offering me work at a buck’s party. Needless to say I declined”<br />
<br />
“Maybe they were just doing the catering”<br />
<br />
“I can’t rule that out. But I don’t think so…… Another thing. There was an Email from Monique’s James. He and Jenna have some type of business arrangement. Do you know anything about that?”<br />
<br />
“That’s news to me. I’ve never liked James much. He has wandering hands”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I noticed when I was you at the engagement dinner. He gave me a feel up when saying goodbye”<br />
<br />
“Well in that body you might have to get used to it. He’s not the only one…….How was Biddy?”<br />
<br />
“Excited to see us. We took him around the block”<br />
<br />
“Thanks. I needed company tonight. I didn’t want to be alone”<br />
<br />
“Well if you need anything just ask. If you are up to it how about we join the others”<br />
<br />
“Before we do. The hospital asked about organ donation. They also suggested we harvest some of Rod’s sperm while he is still alive. Hilda was very keen on the idea. I want your opinion”<br />
<br />
“Umm…………I probably need time to think about that….. We probably should consult Zach as well”<br />
<br />
“Let’s go and help Mum”<br />
………<br />
Mum and Monique had dinner under control but we helped by setting the table. Sarah was able to explain which was the good crockery and which was the never used crockery. I also mentioned I would like to go through the photo albums with her at some stage. She agreed to do so if she saw an opportunity.<br />
<br />
Dinner was a quiet affair with subdued conversation. Sarah raised the issue of organ donation. Mum’s answer was that she hadn’t given up on Rod just yet. Miracles can happen. Monique, James and Dad said they thought donation was a grand gesture.<br />
<br />
After dinner I did the dishes with Monique while Mum and Dad talked quietly with Sarah in the lounge. James had gone to the computer room. After finishing the dishes I went to the toilet. There was still no sign of my period starting. I was in the bathroom washing my hands when James slipped in and shut the door.<br />
<br />
“Shh” he said. Then embraced and kissed me. I pushed him away. “I thought we were past that”<br />
<br />
“What do you want?” I said<br />
<br />
“I need you for another job. Unless you want me to tell of your little secret”<br />
<br />
“What?” He was blackmailing Jenna <br />
<br />
“Nothing you haven’t done before”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure Monique would be interested in your little jobs” He looked uneasy. “I now have an email that I could show her”<br />
<br />
“Just this once, that will be the end of it”<br />
<br />
“How do I know that?”<br />
<br />
“We need the money this would set up the business for us. Mr Chin is back in 3 weeks to sign the contract. All I ask is that you flirt with him, flatter him, pretend you are interested. You can take it as far as you like. Once the contract is signed he is back to Hong Kong and we won’t see him again.”<br />
<br />
“Explain to me why this deal is so important”<br />
<br />
“We can be his agents in Australia. It means we can start a wholesale travel business. Travel to China is set to soar and his company has all the infrastructure in place. We would get a commission on every package sold in Australia”<br />
<br />
“What does Monique know?”<br />
<br />
“Only that he is an important tourism operator in Hong Kong. That he is coming back out to check us out. Please Jenna he asked for you by name”<br />
<br />
“I’ll think about it. But only for Monique’s sake. No more funny business from you. Get out of here”<br />
<br />
He left. I pondered what he had said. It sounded as though he wanted me to be an escort for this Mr Chin. I decided I would consult with Sarah. <br />
<br />
Monique and James were leaving to catch up with Monique’s best friend Angela and her husband. They would be back later. <br />
<br />
I returned to the lounge. Dad had turned the footy on. The Tigers were playing. I was soon enthralled with the game, moaning about umpiring decisions and cheering when the Tigers scored. Mum asked since when had I started following the footy so avidly. I muttered that I had met one of the Tigers players and had a renewed interest. Dad was pleased. He commented that he knew I would come back to the fold eventually. Sarah cheekily asked which player. I had to mutter that I would rather not say and that maybe it wouldn’t go anywhere. I think Dad was chuffed that his daughter might be going out with a footy star.<br />
<br />
At half time Sarah asked if she could borrow some pajama’s. It was an excuse to invite her into my room. Once there I said in a sarcastic tone ”Thanks for making Dad think I’m going out with a Tigers player” <br />
<br />
“With your looks you could fit right in with the WAG’s. Just think you could be attending the Brownlow later this year” <br />
<br />
I showed her the nighties drawer “Select whatever you want” I had forgotten that was where I had left ‘Mr Millionaire’ She came across the box and turned and looked at me<br />
<br />
“I see you are embracing womanhood”<br />
<br />
I could feel myself blushing “I found it this morning, up on the top shelf”…………….“Changing the subject James cornered me in the bathroom earlier. He knows about the stripping and is blackmailing me to play escort to some Chinese travel hotshot. He wants me to flirt with this fellow so he signs Monique’s company to be their Australian agent. I gather this could make or break the business”<br />
<br />
“What are you going to do?”<br />
<br />
“I said I would think about it. I want your advice”<br />
<br />
“If it was me I would say no. But I’m not a part time stripper……..You need to stop the blackmail”<br />
<br />
“He looked taken aback when I threatened to show Monique his email. She would divorce him if she knew”<br />
<br />
“So would you do it to help Monique?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe. I’ll sleep on it”………“A couple of other questions if you have time” she raised her eyebrows. I took that to mean ‘Go ahead’ “Jenna has that medical appointment on Monday. I haven’t cancelled. Would you know what it might be about?”<br />
<br />
“Jenna is healthy as far as I know. I can only rarely recall her even getting a cold. It is probably just a regular check-up”<br />
<br />
“What does that involve?”<br />
<br />
“I imagine just the same as you would have had as Zach. Maybe add a discussion about birth control and at worst a Pap smear”<br />
<br />
“And one more, while I have you here. I notice Jenna had some gym gear in the wash. Would it be unusual to go for a run?”<br />
<br />
“She would just occasionally go for a run. More often she would go swimming. Unlike me, Jenna is a good swimmer”<br />
<br />
“I would like to take up running”<br />
<br />
“Go ahead. No-one will object” She had selected the pajamas I had freshly washed.<br />
<br />
“And the woman next door. I met her and Chrissie this morning. What is her name?”<br />
<br />
“That’s Linda, She is very friendly. Her husband is Tony. I know for a fact that Tony has the hot’s for you. Linda has complained to me that he get’s distracted if you are in the backyard sunbathing. But he is harmless. Chrissie is a little cutie. They are a nice family. I, well both of us have babysat Chrissie over the years. Well big sister if you have finished your questions the 2nd half of the game will be starting”<br />
<br />
I returned to the lounge and watched the rest of the game with Dad. The Tigers had a comfortable victory. Sarah and Mum had gone to bed at 3/4 time. It was a different perspective watching a game as a female. I found myself admiring the athletes bodies as well as their skills and courage.<br />
<br />
I was tired myself and decided Mr Millionaire could be saved for another day. I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.</p>
