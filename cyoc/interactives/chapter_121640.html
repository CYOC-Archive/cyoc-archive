<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘This should be fun.’ Kyle thought to himself as he turned his attention away from the news playing in the next room to finish up the preparations for the feast that was his and his lover’s lunch, briefly glancing around the room at the caved in furniture and cracked door-frames as he recalled just how much food he had to make. The skinny man wiped his brow as he put the last tray of assorted meats into the oven, turning on the timer before slumping into one of the few chairs still standing. Kyle turned his head back to the kitchen doorway at the widescreen TV, seeing another commercial advertising giant sized clothing for the recently transformed. “Hard to believe it’s only been four weeks.” Kyle couldn’t help but laugh, remembering how crazy everything was during the first week, the quarantines and risk of Martial law. But rather than the apparent chaos continuing, by the third week it had become commonplace for women to turn in gigantic beasts of men, some having muscles that would have taken a lifetime at gyms to obtain, other being so fat that any lesser man would be immobile with even a fraction of the weight, and some falling in the middle categories with anything from bodybuilder, to superchub. As Kyle began to drift back down memory lane for the last four weeks, an advertisement for a new gym finished and the intro for the news played, the small man returning his attention to the screen as he figured it’d be interesting to see what the guest had to say about changing, well that and there’s nothing else on. <br />
<br />
As the conference room was displayed, Kyle couldn’t help but chuckle a bit. On either side of the seated news anchor was a massive man, to his left was a morbidly obese whale of a man, towering over everyone as his wide ass filled the reinforce bench that looked to be groaning under him. The gigantic, hairy sumo adjusted his tie as he waited for the introductions to be done, the sweat-stain covered, custom suit he was wearing audibly straining as the buttons struggled to contain his enormous gut and chest.The mini-giant bear signalling one of the stage hands close, the tiny guy having to climb a step ladder to wipe the forming sweat from the massive man’s face, it was then Kyle noticed the heavy five o’clock shadow on his bulbous cheeks and two thick chins.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the desk sat a muscle gutted beast, whilst his fatter counterpart was dressed in a suit, the more muscular one wore simple workout shorts that stretched across his muscular thighs as he sat cross legged on the floor, the sleeveless shirt doing nothing but highlighting his massive gut and muscles as it practically covered only the barest amount of skin across his thick chest. Kyle could see the thick trails of hair across his body, looking up passed his pecs and bull sized neck to his head, seeing the fully bearded face looking straight to the camera and giving a confident wink. Kyle raised a surprised eyebrow as the muscle gutted bear proceeded to shift his enormous body, flexing his impossible massive arms above the stage hands heads as he seemed to relish in his gigantic form. He was eventually snapped out of it as the news anchor coughed, signalling the show beginning.<br />
<br />
“Welcome back, I’m Curtis O’Jones. Today I’m joined by Doctor Carl McGrath,” The news anchor gestured to his right towards the obese bear, earning a rather meek wave to the camera, the suit arm straining from the little movement. “And Joe Creesly.” He gestured to his left, ‘Joe’ smiling before raising both arms in a double flex pose, causing his already thick biceps to swell out more in size as he exposed the thick forest of armpit hair. <br />
<br />
“Good to be on the show Curtis.” Joe greeted proudly, his deep voice shaking the tiny water glasses on the table between them. The tiny anchorman having to hold on to the table as the force of the deep voice shook him also.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for the honor.” Carl greeted, brushing the forming sweat from his forehead again, trying not to be as loud with his own deep, fat filled voice as the other changed bear across from him.<br />
<br />
“Please, the honor’s all mine. Thank you both for agreeing to be on the show. I only have a few questions that I believe even the viewers at home are curious about.” Curtis said as he sorted the flashcards that had been prepared, looking at both mini-giants as he reviewed the questions. “Now some of these have been submitted by viewers as well, I hope you two can answer them as honestly as you can.” The two massive bears nodded in agreement, Carl fat cheeks, jowls and chins jiggling from the movement as Joe’s thick neck flexed from the slight action, swelling out and straining the neck hole of his shirt. “Alright. The first question; What did it feel like to change?”<br />
<br />
Carl groaned slightly before answering, “It was a rather...disorienting experience. The virus causes instant changes so one moment I was a rather petite woman, the next I&#39;m, this.” The doctor emphasized this by placing both baseball mitt sized hands on his mountain of a gut, the belly wobbling about causing two buttons from his suit to pop off. “It was rather tricky dealing with the sudden shift in height and mass, having to purchase custom fitting clothing that get outgrown after a few days. Honestly it was tiring, especially dealing with housing as most furniture can&#39;t hold up my weight without collapsing, even the reinforced bench you provided isn&#39;t holding up.” With that the massively obese bear grunted as he stood up, towering high as the camera shifted focus to the bench, seeing it covered in forming cracks as the imprint of Carl’s wide asscheeks were easily seen. After a few moments the super-sized sumo sat back down, landing with a dull thud on the bench, the room shaking from the force as he panted from the exertion. “... not to mention… the effort needed…*pant*...to move this bulk…” He continued panting some more before bringing one hand up to cover his mouth as he tried to stifle a belch, the covered explosion of gas still audible. “S-sorry…”<br />
<br />
“I’ll admit, it was weird the first time. I just stared down at my massive body as I took in what happened, seeing the shredded remains of my dress as I stood as the massive beast you see how.” Joe began speaking his answer, raising his thick, muscular arms as he flexed again, smirking as he looked past his barrel chest down to his gut. “Course, after the initial shock I&#39;m enjoying just how big I’ve become. I mean, sure I struggle to find decent clothing to go out, and I gotta be careful when picking things up. But man, the strength I got now. And these thick guns,” The massive power lifter leaned his body close to Curtis and flexed his arm again, showing off how big the engorged bicep was compared to the tiny anchorman.<br />
<br />
“I-I see.” Curtis visibly blushed at the hair covered arm filled his view, most likely thankful that the table covered the camera view of everything below his waist. “Let’s move to the next question. ‘How has this affected your personal life?’ “<br />
<br />
Joe chuckled deeply at the question, clearly wanting to answer first. “Let’s just say being this big makes you the life of the party. Especially when you can do one armed bicep curls with a filled up couch. I mean sure, kind of have to pig out at parties to fill up this tank,” The muscle bear patted his solid belly, pausing as it wobbled slightly before he continued on. “But gotta keep these muscles big. Especially since my boyfriend enjoys being hoisted up against this bulging body. Little guy enjoys it when I pin him under my wrecking ball of a gut.” Joe chuckled out as both Curtis and Carl blushed from the muscular bear’s rather crude answer.<br />
<br />
Carl coughed slightly before starting his answer. “Unlike my eccentric companion, my social life has been regular since my transformation. Mainly other scientists continuing to examine the effects of the virus, the occasional friend stopping by for a chat.” The morbidly obese bear grunted slightly as he leaned forward, his belly touching the ground and spreading under the table as he grabbed one of the comparatively shot glass sized drinks in his giant hand, bringing it up to his face and downing the water quickly before he continued. “In regards to my private life with my husband, it’s been trying, specially since my larger stature makes it rather tricky to perform simple tasks I used to be able to do with ease. Though we have been managing.” <br />
<br />
Curtis nodded at the answer, taking a quick sip from his own glass of water before looking back to the cue cards. “Alright, now the next question to ask is-oh.” The small anchorman stopped mid-sentence as he took in the question, blushing slightly as tried to cover his pause with a clearly forced cough. “What’s the most embarrassing thing to happen since becoming huge?” Curtis read the question out loud, earning nervous chuckles and blushing faces from both massive men, and most likely from the audience watching from home too.<br />
<br />
“Oh dear, most embarrassing moment…” Carl thought the question over out loud, clearly not comfortable with the matter but answering anyway. “Well, I suppose I have one example. A few days ago, as I was resting when my husband called me to help him. Unfortunately as I went to move through the house, I had gotten myself stuck in one of the doorways. It took almost half an hour with my husband’s help to get un-stuck.” <br />
<br />
“That’s it? Hell, I’ve gotten stuck in doorways plenty of times.” Joe said, grumbling slightly at the rather weak moment. <br />
<br />
“I’m not finished. You see when I finally managed to push myself back out of the tight spot, my husband was assisting,. As I managed to plop out, I had lost my footing and fell backwards down on him.” The morbidly obese bear blushed deeply as he continued on with the story, the muscular man across from him smirking as he figured how this tale was going to go. “And as I landed on him, shaking the house considerable, I had cause quite a stir within my stomach, resulting in a buildup of gas and-”<br />
<br />
“Oh God, so not only did you squash your husband under your massive ass, but you farted on him too.” Joe let out a deep, room shaking laugh as he heard the story, slamming his hand down on the tiny table as he continued to laugh at the other bear’s misfortune. Even Curtis couldn’t help but chuckle at the story, as Carl turned red with embarrassment before crossing his thick arms over, his suit continued to creak in warning as the seams at the back began to give way. “I don’t think I can top that.”<br />
<br />
“Then why don’t you.”<br />
<br />
“Heh sure thing. Well, this happened at a party me and my boyfriend went to. Plenty of drinks and food, Anyway me and the boytoy sneak to one of the rooms for some… fun.” Joe began, choosing his words carefully as he remembered he was on tv. “So we&#39;re having a lark on this tiny bed, the things practically destroyed and I place my hands on a wall. Thing is I use a little too much strength and the entire wall collapse, both mine and my boyfriend’s bare ass bodies on full display for the party guests. I swear I saw a couple of guys taking photos, probably to use later to jack-” <br />
<br />
“And I think that’s enough on that question.” Curtis abruptly spoke up, interrupting the larger man before he could get into too much detail. The tiny man looked over his flashcards to speak the next question. “Alright, this is the last one; What would you do if a cure for the ‘Bear-Disease’ was discovered?” Curtis looked up from his card to see both transformed men deep in thought as they focused on the question.<br />
<br />
“Easy. I’ll do nothing.” Joe said confidently, looking down at Custis before flexing his powerful muscles more, making his entire body swell out more. “I’m not gonna stop anyone from changing back. But the Hell am I going to throw this powerful body away just cause I wanna be a tiny girl again. Especially if I can focus on getting bigger” He grunted as he puffed out his chest, his erect nipples trying to force their way through the failing material, his shirt stretching to hold back the wall of muscle before ripping open, exposing the thick, hair covered flesh of his pecs. <br />
<br />
“Yes well,” Carl began saying, glancing at Joe as the Columnist simply yanked off the ruined shirt effortlessly, fully exposing his gigantic body. The Obese men turned back to Curtis, who was also staring at the massive, hairy wall of pecs, and continued what he was saying. “Whilst I initially had full hope for a cure to return me to my original form. I’ll admit I have my reluctance to do so now if given the option. As I’m sure this station has seen, many, if not all,of the transformed make it clear that they prefer to remain as the immense beasts they have become. I can say that research into a cure has been slow going, so I wouldn’t exactly be holding my breath.” Carl explained his own reasoning behind what he’d do if presented with a cure, rubbing his gigantic gut and patting it as it gurgled loudly. “Besides, I must admit I’m rather fond of this size.” He said deeply before leaning his enormous body to the side and grunting before a deep, powerful fart rumbled out of him, shaking the entire set for a solid fifteen seconds before it died down. Carl flopped back down into his seat as he wiped sweat from his forehead. “Phew, been holding that in since we started.” He said deeply, rubbing his belly as he earned approval from both Joe and Curtis, the smaller man being more subtle with his praise as he turned to the camera. <br />
<br />
“And with that, we’re done with this segment. Next we’ll have our own Alex Bates with his segment, ‘How to stuff your Beast on a budget.’ I’m Custis O’Jones and I hope you enjoyed yourself.” The announce said, the two bears turning to the camera and giving their farewells, Carl shifting his gut and causing more buttons to pop off, as Joe winked to the camera and struck his most muscular pose yet, swelling out his already impressive form as the screen changed over to commercial . <br />
<br />
“Fuck, that was amazing.” Kyle couldn’t help but say, standing up from his chair and stretching a bit as he recalled what he just saw, impressed by the sheer size of the two guest before chuckling. ‘Don’t have anything on Sam.’ He thought to himself as he recalled how big the Columnist’s biceps were. Before the lithe man could focus more the timer he set rang out, signalling the food was ready. Kyle sighed as he headed towards the oven, opening it up to check the three fully loaded trays of assorted meats. He turned off the heat as he saw them fully cooked, juices sizzling as the assorted spices on top added to the heavenly smell of the roasted protein sources. Kyle pulled one of the trays out and plucked a piece of chicken breast out with a fork, putting it on a plate before cutting through and opening it up to check it was cooked all the way through. <br />
<br />
“Perfect.” He said out loud as he took in the steaming piece of white meat, glad it came out well as he began plating the various foods, moving back and forth from the kitchen counter to the dining table. He sighed as he placed the last plate, covering the surface with the stacks of food, distributing a comparatively small portion on a separate plate for himself, knowing that Sam would consume everything before Kyle could grab something for himself. <br />
<br />
As Kyle placed the last of the food on the table, sighing at a job finally done, the sound of the front door lock being turned followed by the now familiar echo of creaking wood signalled the arrival of Sam, which was confirmed with a deep voice sounding off into the house.<br />
<br />
“Hun, I’m home.”<br />
<br />
“I’m in the dining room Sam.” Kyle called out, feeling the house shake as he knew Sam was making his way towards the room, the lithe man turning to the doorway as it was filled with a pair of muscular thighs squeezed into workout shorts, a thick waist that lead to a hair covered eight pack, a massive shelf of pecs that disappeared halfway passed the doorway top. Kyle smiled as he watch the gigantic man crouch down, revealing the thick neck, rugged, bearded face and close cropped hair, seeing him carefully put one massively muscular arm through the doorway before turning and pushing his body through, grunting as his sweaty body squeezed by the comparatively narrow opening, his broad shoulders making the walls creak ominously as he forced his way in. Kyle watched with a smirk as Sam eventually managed to squeeze in, panting from having to twist his body about as the doorframe looked more or less intact. “Nice job Hun, had a good workout?” Kyle chuckled as he looked up at Sam’s face, having to step back to see pass the massive, heaving pecs that clouded the hulking man’s view. The semi-giant man chuckled deeply as he looked down at Kyle, lifting his muscular arm up to flex as his medicine ball sized bicep swelled out, showing off the definition with thick veins pulsing over the muscle before Sam brought his arm down. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, nothing beats deadlifting a couple of trees for a quick warm up.” The massive man crouched down, his whole body seeming to swell as his muscles flexed out further, still towering over Kyle as he smirked, “And what have you been up to, Hun?” <br />
<br />
Kyle had to force his eyes from the hairy carpet that were Sam’s pecs, looking up at the handsome, bearded face that practically dominated the smaller man’s view. “Just did some cleaning and cooking.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I can see that.” Sam smirked more as he easily looked over his smaller boyfriend towards the table laden with food, licking his lips before wrapping arm around Kyle and hoisting him up, carrying the practically weightless man over the small distance, chuckling some as he placed the tiny man in his seat before sitting down on the floor next to him with a dull thud, Sam crossing his legs over as he pulled one of the trays close to him. “This looks great as always Kyle.” He said before proceeding to wolf down to meats, tearing the food off the bone with little effort as he devoured the sheer amount of protein. <br />
<br />
“Sam, can you not pick me up suddenly?” Kyle voiced his concern, not exactly happy with being carried by his massive sweating boyfriend without warning as he looked up at the seated beast, watching him finish off one of the trays, stopping only to let out a deep, room shaking belch before moving on to the next pile. <br />
<br />
“Sorry Kyle, wanted to get started on the food quickly.” He said, grabbing a large chicken drumstick before cleaning the meat off the bone with one bite, barely chewing before swallowing it down. “Besides, can&#39;t say you didn&#39;t like it when I lift you up. Specially when you get to feel my massive muscles.” <br />
<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t do anything but blush at the comment, crossing his legs in hope of hiding his obvious arousal as he looked at Sam’s massive, hair covered muscles, seeing them flex and pulse as the large man continued his feast. Sam himself chuckled deeply as he took in his smaller boyfriend’s reaction. <br />
<br />
“See. No need to be bashful. All this beef is for you too.” The muscular bear reassured as he stopped consuming food, raising both arms up and flexing them more, making himself seem even bigger to Kyle before he swiftly returned to his meal. With that obvious show, the smaller of the two decided to partake of his own meal, using a fork and knife to cut through the food on his plate as he snuck glances up at Sam, watching him continue to eat without losing speed, food that would have fed an average family of four for a week quickly disappearing down the massive muscle bear. Kyle could see the only evidence of the food having been there was the puddles of grease on the plates (which Sam was soaking as much as he could onto the meat) and the slight swelling of Sam’s stomach, making his abs look more prominent as he continued to gorge down.<br />
<br />
In the time it took Kyle to finish his plate of two beef cutlets and a slice of chicken breast, Sam had complete obliterated the piles of food that had been on the table, the massive man chugging down a two liter bottle of soda like it was a small can before letting out a deep, manly belch shaking the entire room as he patted and rubbed his swollen abs. <br />
<br />
“That was delicious hun. URRRP!” Sam said, punctuating the sentence with another belch as Kyle stood from his seat, moving close to the giant man as he placed his small hand against Sam’s stomach, feeling it gurgle deeply from being loaded with food. <br />
<br />
“Glad you think so Sam.” The smaller man said, patting the larger man before suddenly being lifted up in a hug, the thick, muscular arms pulling up close, the salty stench of sweat and B.O. filling his nose as he brushed against the hair covered body. Kyle was dragged up by Sam’s powerful arms, feeling the hair covered abs and heave slabs of meat that are the giant man’s pecs before being brought past the thick muscular neck and coming face to face with Sam’s bearded face, the massive man chuckling deeply before pulling the smaller man close to kiss him, his large mouth dominating the smaller man’s face.</p>
