<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer was awe-struck by her body&#39;s capabilities, but wanted to know more about it, like how does it work? Are there any limitations? She decided to investigate further of her powers. She twisted her body parts back into their proper position, and walked out of her room. She went to the kitchen, and brought out a knife. She put her hand on the chopping board by the edge of the cutting table. She thought &quot;If I could detach body parts, does it apply to every single part of me, or just at the limbs? Also can the detachment occur subconsciously, without me doing it intentionally?&quot; She readied her arm, and brought the knife down at her arm. She pushed the knife into her arm, and found a slight resistance, but kept on pushing, until it was halfway into her arm, and there were no signs of bone blocking her cut, finally she pushed and chopped her whole arm off. She recoiled in fascination, the stump ending in the middle between her elbow and her wrist. She observed at the stump, and saw no signs of blood, just soft, smooth flesh. She poked at her stump, and found it to be soft, and slightly pleasurable.<br />
 <br />
She then decided to do something more risky, but kinky, and put her right breast onto the chopping board. She then proceeded to cut up her breast up into small pieces, unaware that she was starting to lean onto one side of the board. The cold board touched the underside of her breast, and stimulated her, sending pleasure signals to the brain. She chopped her breast up into small bits, and the sensation was astounding, as if her whole breast was surrounded by the chopping board, and some bits feeling another part of her breast, it was all so sensational and rich. Suddenly the board flipped, and sent the pieces of her cut off arm onto the floor. She stared at the scrambled pieces, not knowing which piece is which. She poked at one piece, and felt that it was the underside of her boob. She was at a loss of words, and tried to figure out how to get out of this predicament. She thought, maybe she could concentrate on thinking about joining back together? She focused her mind, and thought of how her original breasts looked like, whilst staring at the diced breast. The pieces began to shift towards each other, like a magnet on its poles, and stuck together when its matched. She watched in awe as more and more pieces clumped up together, until it formed large chunks. She then put then together, and her breast was reformed. She stuck it back onto her chest, and it looked like as if she had never touch or harmed it. <br />
<br />
Now that she knew she was basically indestructible, since she could let herself detach at will or subconsciously at any location, she could basically avoid any harm done to her. She then went to great lengths of her power, and took out the woodchopper her dad had in the garage. She stuck her arm back to her stump, and went out to the garage. Since her parents were out on a trip, and she lived in the rural-ubran fringe, she wasn&#39;t worried about anyone seeing her naked, and walked right out of her door to the garage, the cool breeze whipping on her sensitive nipples and pussy. She took the wood chipper outside, and revved up the machine. She thought of the things that may go wrong, but then calmed her self by thinking that she survived being cut up, and that any part of her would still work like her diced breast. She braced herself, and jumped into the chipper, flesh colored bits flying out at the end. She experienced no pain, and simply felt a large massage on every part of her body. She found out that she didn&#39;t have eyes to speak of, or any organ, which meant that she was simply a block of living flesh if she were pieced together. She pondered over this idea for a long time, and was further proved right when she found out that she could see in every bit of her body. She thought &quot;There may be more to this curse than I thought...&quot; She then tried to piece herself back together, and felt her bits and pieces shifting and grinding against the grass, until they stuck together to form tissue, organs, and body parts. Jennifer then lied on the ground in defined pieces, and simply laid there in silence, the grass tickling her with the gentle breeze, her nipples and clit being more sensitive than normal, but she resisted the temptation to masturbate right there on the spot. She attempted to try her theory of every part of her being able to be anything, since all parts of her are the same fleshy bits, then she must be also able to choose which part will be what. She closed her original eyes, and tried to see from her arm, and directly saw the grass under her. She then try to change the particular area to be an eyeball, and it worked! She figured that every part is the same, and since every part is also every other part, her whole body can be shaped into any form! She then attached herself back together, her arms and legs crawling back together, sticking other her torso stumps, and her chest snapping back onto the lower torso, and finally her head onto her neck. She basked in the sensation of being back herself, and knew that her powers were much more vast than she originally thought. She wanted to try the chipping again, but thought that she had much more to test, and drove the chipper back into the garage, and went back into the house.</p>
