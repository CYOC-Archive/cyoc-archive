<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Just to help keep track of characters: Danny dared Hugo to dick him, Steve wanted to be a dick, Dave screams obscenities cause he doesn&#39;t want to be a dick, Troy, Perry was passed out drunk when dicked, William has a boyfriend, Jacob biggest dick, Bryan semi-religious, Brock wanted pictures of Bryan&#39;s before and after. A total of twenty dicked men so with nine named, there are eleven that haven&#39;t been named yet in this story.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the first part of this chapter was written by Transformatus.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn&#39;t that George hated Danny, per say. In fact, he rather liked the guy and his easy smiles. Danny was the chill dude on campus, with good grades and a good body. Most people liked him. And when he got assigned to work together with Danny on one of their physics&#39; project together, he&#39;d been ecstastic!<br />
<br />
They had worked well, gotten an excellent grade and now George was part of Danny&#39;s study sessions.<br />
<br />
He had just hoped he could get invited to one of Danny&#39;s parties.<br />
<br />
George frowned a little as he stared at the screenshot on his screen. It didn&#39;t seem like a photoshot, and Danny&#39;s skills with computers weren&#39;t that great, he probably wouldn&#39;t do this much work just for a ten minutes prankcall. That... that was Danny&#39;s actual dick.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d had so many wet dreams about that dick. And there it was, casually shown to him as part of a study session. The things he would do to Danny... He&#39;d have him begging to become his boyfriend, no, better, his sex toy! He&#39;d said someone at the frat party had used a camera to transform him into his own dick. George had to get his hands on that. And Danny. With the camera, he could reverse-engineer it and become rich, and with Danny as his faithful sex-toy, he&#39;d live the perfect life!<br />
<br />
Contrary to Danny, George WAS a computer expert, almost at genius level. Hacking had been one of his hobby growing up. So, with a determined look at the screenshot of Danny&#39;s dicked body, George pulled out the signal from Danny&#39;s computer and started triangulating.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the police raided the home of Hugo. Hugo tried to call the ship for help but Donshel intercepted the signal and told Hugo, &quot;Sorry but I&#39;m calling an end to your experiment. All the subliminal messaging and your connection to the shipboard computer has been stopped.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo got arrested and all his dicked guys were gathered up along with other evidence. Then it was up to lawyers and judges to determine what to do about the dicked guys.<br />
<br />
The first thing they needed to decide was what to do with the dicked guys, whether to release them or keep them as evidence. Only a few of the dicks could talk and explain that they were really humans. The judge declared, however, that they were not humans. The judge said, &quot;They have the legal status of being objects. They may have once been humans but they aren&#39;t anymore. Therefore, they will be kept in an evidence locker, will be entered as evidence exhibits in future cases and will not be allowed to testify.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the lawyers objected, &quot;You mean we can&#39;t even get their story of how they were dicked in the first place?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Judge said, &quot;Very well, you may gather their testimonies as written statements to be submitted to the court but you may not call them to the witness stand. They are to be silenced during the trials.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, Danny&#39;s father, Richard Thompson, filed an appeal but the appeal would take time. In the meantime, Danny and the others would spend their time piled together in a box. Danny&#39;s, Steve&#39;s, Perry&#39;s and Brock&#39;s mics were left on so that they could still talk.<br />
<br />
Perry was talking like a schizophrenic. He&#39;d already had some mental problems which was why he so frequently got drunk but then after the attempted brainwashing by Hugo, Perry had a hard time telling reality from fiction. He kept saying things like, &quot;But I am a cock. Hugo didn&#39;t steal me. He created me. Why did they arrest him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny and Brock had mixed feelings about being dicked. They both had agreed to it but they both had thought it would be temporary. They both enjoyed it but they also both wanted to eventually become human again.<br />
<br />
Steve asked, &quot;Why? Isn&#39;t it great being a dick, to stop thinking about all the unpleasant parts of being a human and be totally focused on pleasure? I just want to get between someone&#39;s legs and stay there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve kept doing what he could to get an orgy going and he wasn&#39;t the only cock doing so. It was hard to tell which dicks started it but it wasn&#39;t long before all twenty dicks were aroused and throbbing against each other. Even Dave and Bryan couldn&#39;t help themselves but be aroused. Bryan kept telling himself, &quot;This is wrong, This is so wrong.&quot; But all twenty dicks shot at least one load of cum onto all the others making their bed slick, squishy and sticky before they fell asleep for the night.<br />
<br />
The bailiff that retrieved them the next morning retrieved a cum soaked cardboard box full of cum covered cocks. The cocks were unceremoniously dumped in a bucket of water while the cardboard box was discarded. That&#39;s where they stayed while lawyers would fish them out one by one to get their written statements.<br />
<br />
It was hard to know what crimes to charge Hugo with. Had he committed kidnapping of twenty men or theft of twenty cocks? What about what had been done to the cocks after they had been transformed? Did that count as sexual assault?<br />
<br />
Since the dicks were declared objects instead of humans, they couldn&#39;t be the clients that the lawyers represented. Danny&#39;s dad had a lawyer and William&#39;s boyfriend had a lawyer. Other family and friends stepped up to sue Hugo so most of the dicks indirectly had lawyers. But no one wanted to sue Hugo on behalf of Bryan or Perry. Bryan&#39;s family disowned him for being a dick and Bryan&#39;s pastor even wanted to sue Bryan for defamation.<br />
<br />
Bryan wasn&#39;t the only dick being sued either. Bryan wanted to sue Brock and the other guys that stripped him. Jacob wanted to sue Troy for sexual assault. A girl wanted to sue Danny and Danny wanted to sue several guys that had played with him.<br />
<br />
This meant several days of being moved from one court trial to another and several days of being picked up and handled by one lawyer after another. The lawyers loved to raise the dicks high and show them to the jury and audience. And yes there were cameras filming everything.<br />
<br />
Danny&#39;s dad objected to the lack of privacy and his lawyer said, &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be displaying dicks in public.&quot; Another lawyer shot back, &quot;But these dicks are the heart of the case. How can we even try the case if we&#39;re not allowed to examine the evidence?&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge decided that the cameras should censor their recordings but that didn&#39;t stop uncensored clips from being leaked. The judge also decided that instead of letting the dicks being held up for all to see, the dicks should be passed around for all to examine but kept in bags so they wouldn&#39;t be seen. This meant that the dicks got touched more and became aroused more often.<br />
<br />
Then some of the lawyers argued how the dicks wanted to stay dicks as evidenced by their frequent arousal despite whatever they had said in their written statements.<br />
<br />
On the kidnapping charges, it was decided that the only dick that had been kidnapped was Perry because all the other dicks agreed to it. But even the kidnapping of Perry was the fault of the guy who dicked Perry, not Hugo&#39;s fault. The guy that dicked Perry turned out to be Jacob but Jacob was a dick and couldn&#39;t be sentenced since he wasn&#39;t a human anymore.<br />
<br />
Hugo was charged with theft though because none of the dicks belonged to him. Then came a series of custody battles to determine who did own each dick. Danny&#39;s dad won custody of Danny and William&#39;s boyfriend won custody of William. Brock wound up in the custody of Roger, a friend who didn&#39;t want Brock to be a cock. Several people wanted Steve, Dave, Troy, and Jacob so their custody remained undecided. Nobody wanted Perry or Bryan so they were put up for auction. The people who got custody of the dicks also got custody of the dicks&#39; former possessions. For example, Brock had a car that was given to Roger since Roger now owned Brock. Brock convinced Roger to use his newly gained wealth to purchase Bryan. Roger had no interest in dicks but he bought Bryan to give to Brock as soon as Brock could be turned back into a human.<br />
<br />
The lawsuits against Jacob, Bryan, Brock, Troy and Danny would have to be postponed as long as they stayed cocks. If they became human again and the various statute of limitations had not expired, they could be sued but as long as they remained cocks, they were immune.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the lawsuits by the cocks depended on whether the cocks could get someone to sue on their behalf. Therefore, Bryan&#39;s lawsuit was stalled because no one would sue on his behalf. Jacob&#39;s lawsuit was stalled until it could be decided who would get custody of Jacob. But Danny&#39;s dad did sue several guys on Danny&#39;s behalf which meant even more days of Danny being passed around as a piece of evidence.<br />
<br />
As to whether any of the dicks would be restored to human? With the exception of Perry, the judge left that as a matter to be negotiated with Hugo. Since Hugo hadn&#39;t kidnapped any of them and they had all agreed to be dicked, there was no legal requirement for Hugo to restore any of them to humanity. Whether Perry would be restored to humanity was left undetermined because Perry was incapable of making a rational decision as to whether he even wanted to be human or not.<br />
<br />
Danny&#39;s dad and Roger both pressed Hugo to return Danny and Brock to human but Hugo told Danny&#39;s dad, &quot;Danny never clarified the terms of the dare. Leaving the dare open like that means that by rights, I should be able to keep Danny my dick forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny&#39;s dad said, &quot;Absolutely not. He&#39;s my son and he&#39;s coming home with me to continue his education and learn how to take over the business. Will you take money or maybe require Danny to do a dare as payment for restoring him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo said, &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I want. I want Danny to be my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo told Roger, &quot;Brock lost at gambling. You&#39;ll have to go to his gambling buddies to see how much it&#39;s worth to them to restore Brock to humanity. As for me, I want you to spend a week as my cock, then I will restore both you and Brock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, George whose schemes had gotten the police involved still wanted to get Danny between his legs.</p>
