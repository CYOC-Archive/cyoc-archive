<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley was still looking in the mirror, looking how his body has changed. He lightly fingered the 6 or 7 brown hairs that had sprouted in the center of his chest. Riley was in disbelief; &quot;I have chest hair now?&quot;, he mumbled in his now deeper, changed voice.<br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s mind was in conflict; half of it was telling him that his new body was totally normal and had been like this, that his body hair, BO, muscles, deep voice, and bigger cock were all normal. Another part of his mind screamed that this wasn&#39;t normal! That part of his mind could remember his, and his roommate Kyle&#39;s, old bodies; they were skinny, small, and hairless! It wasn&#39;t possible how they had changed so much!<br />
<br />
Riley heard the shower stop. A couple moments later, Kyle stepped out, with just a towel wrapped around his waste. Riley gazed at the small patch of chest hair and the big bush of armpit hair his roommate now possessed. Riley saw that Kyle now had a lot of hair on his lower belly, surrounding his belly button. Riley assumed the trail kept going into a large pubic bush. Watching Kyle, he felt a twinge in his crotch. Fuck, he was getting hard, again!<br />
<br />
Riley was tired of this confusion over his body. &quot;Hey Kyle, do you notice anything different about your or my body lately?&quot;, Riley asked. Kyle gave him a confused look. &quot;What do you mean, dude?&quot;, Kyle asked. &quot;Well, were both getting all big and hairy! I think we used to be a lot smaller and hairless. I mean we both have chest hair! I don&#39;t even think you had pit hair a week ago, and now look!&quot;, Riley said, raising Kyle&#39;s arm to expose the big brown pit bush he now had.<br />
<br />
Kyle put his arm down and looked at Riley with concern; &quot;Dude, are you okay? We have been like this for a long time! What are you talking about?&quot;, Kyle said. Riley mind went a bit fuzzy. Part of his brain was telling him what Kyle said was true. He didn&#39;t know what to believe. &quot;Nevermind, dude&quot;, Riley said. Kyle looked at Riley with a bit of concern, and then walked off to his room to change.<br />
<br />
Riley glanced at his watch. He still had enough time to shower before class. He walked into the bathroom and stripped al his clothes off. His hairy cock flopped out of his boxers. &quot;Whoa!&quot;. It was definitely bigger, and much thicker. It also looked like he had much more pubes than before. He also saw the pubes went a bit higher, and it connected into a growing treasure trail. It was small now, but he could tell it would get bigger. <br />
<br />
He quickly jumped in the shower and washed off. He grabbed a bar of soap and started washing his armpits and crotch. It was so surreal to be soaping those parts up now that they were so much more hairy. He especially scrubbed his pits pretty hard, because they stunk earlier.<br />
<br />
He got out of the shower and dried off. He grabbed a towel and went to his room. Looking through his clothes, he saw that they had changed; he now had a lot of athletic shorts, jockstraps, and sleeveless shirts or tank tops. &quot;Where did all my old clothes go!&quot;, he said. He didn&#39;t have time to think about it. He threw on a pair of athletic shorts and a blue sleeveless t shirt.<br />
<br />
He grabbed hit backpack and walked to class. It was biology today. He got to the lecture right on time. As the professor began to talk, Riley instantly started to feel incredibly bored. Plus, the lecture wasn&#39;t making any sense. Riley had always thought Bio was really easy and interesting. Maybe it&#39;s just a dull lesson. After 25 minutes, Riley decided to cut class; he just couldn&#39;t understand anything and he was super bored. That was his only class that day, so he walked back to his dorm. As he walked, Riley itched his stomach, chest, pits, and ass contantly. He didn&#39;t know why he was so itchy, but it was really annoying him!<br />
<br />
He got in the door and saw Kyle sitting in the living room doing sit ups. &quot;Hey dude&quot;, Kyle grunted in between sets. He finally finished and got up. &quot;You ready dude?&quot;, Kyle asked Riley. Riley didn&#39;t know what Kyle meant; &quot;Ready for what?&quot;. Kyle looked at Riley in a confused manner, &quot;Dude, today is our gym day. We always go around this time!&quot;. Riley&#39;s head started to hurt; new memories were forcing their way into his head, that him and Kyle went to the gym together all the time. Part of his knew they never went to the gym, but the other part was telling him this was wrong. Riley thought about it; it might clear his head to get a good work out in. He really did enjoy lifting and working out. &quot;Oh yeah, dude, sorry, I forgot&quot;. Riley and Kyle grabbed their gym stuff and headed out the door.<br />
<br />
Kyle and Riley both ran at the start of their work out and then quickly moved to weights. Kyle was first up. He removed his shirt, and Riley could see Kyle&#39;s whole sweaty torso on display. The hair on his stomach and the few hairs on his chest were matted down. He sat on the bench and started to lift, with Riley spotting him. Riley was impressed with how much weight he lifted. Riley watched Kyle&#39;snow impressive biceps bulge and lift the massive weights. Riley&#39;s eyes wandered to the thick bushes of hair popping out from Kyle&#39;s pits. They were really sweaty, and Riley thought that there was more hair. Suddenly, a thought raced through his head; &quot;I wonder what they smell like. I bet they smell awesome&quot;. Riley was disgusted he had just thought that; &quot;Smelling my roommates armpit? Why the hell did I just think that&quot;. He tried to forget about it, but he couldn&#39;t help but notice that the thought made his thick member twitch in the workout shorts.<br />
<br />
Riley was next. He did a couple sets and was really surprised how much he could do and how easy it was. <br />
<br />
After they had both worked up a decent sweat, they called it quits. They grabbed their gear and headed back to their dorms together. As they walked, Riley noticed they both stunk pretty bad. Kyle sniffed his pit and dramatically waved his nose. Riley laughed at that, as he scratched one of his hairy armpits. The walk was short and the boys made it back to their dorm in only a little bit of time.</p>
