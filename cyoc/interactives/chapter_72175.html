<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice pulled up to the beach house, still joking with Jessica after their vacation last year. "Can you believe Katie pulled his suit down?! What a bitch!" The two of the laughed as they walked up to the door. The two cars parked in the driveway showed that their friends had already arrived before them.
</br>
</br>
"There you two sluts are!" came the call from upstairs. It was Kathrine without a doubt. Kathrine was the wild one of the group and a poster child for beach babes everywhere. As their college friend descended down the stairs to wrap her arms around the two, Alice and Jessica quickly noticed the two new assets that pressed against them.
</br>
</br>
"<b>Another</b> boob job, Katie?" Alice asked incredulously.
</br>
</br>
"Ya like?" Kathrine asked, standing back to model. Her skin was richly tanned, which contrasted her sun-bleached blonde hair that kept it's shape as she moved. She was already wearing a skimpy outfit as if she'd just gotten back from clubbing, despite the early hour. Her face was pasted with mascara and blush and everything else all set to highlight her already gorgeous looks. Most noticeable, however, were the massive mounds that jutted out from her chest. Kathrine had work done before, but it seemed like "big" was never "big enough" for the party girl.
</br>
</br>
"Yeah, Katie, they look great," Alice said non-noncommittally. It all seemed a little pointless after finding out about Jessica's Chronivac. Her hands stroked her bikini top unconsciously, thinking about the bizarre device. Jessica seemed completely lost to the word, a blank grin on her face as the vibrator in her ass continued to work its magic. She nodded to Kathrine as her eyes roamed her scantily-clad friend's body.
</br>
</br>
"Come on, come on!" Kathrine urged as she ran up the steps, her red thong in plain sight thanks to her mini-skirt. "Mary! They're hereeeeeee! Woo!"
</br>
</br>
The upstairs was a massive room decorated with simple furnishings. An open balcony loomed behind the massive sliding glass doors and gave the girls a stunning view of the beach. On a few occasions last summer, it also gave the beach goers a stunning view of Jessica and her solo shows. The group of friends were well aware of Jessie's kinky side. Mary was a surprising contrast to the group. She was reclining in the loveseat with a book cradled in her lap. <i>Some trashy romance novel,</i> Alice reasoned, <i>it was always the same with here. Always wishing and never hunting.</i> Mary's long brown hair was held back in a loose pony tail that framed the thick glasses that rested on the bridge of her nose. A small splash of freckles dotted her face, giving her more of a cute look than anything sexy like Kathrine. Her tiny frame was covered by a bulky sweatshirt and pajama pants.
</br>
</br>
"I know, Katie," Mary said, clearly exasperated, "I heard them pull in. And then I heard you screaming and yammering on." Mary wasn't exactly a big fan of Katherine. After high school, Mary began pursuing a career in science while Kathrine took to clubbing late at night and hooking up with men with money. The girls never knew if it was disgust or jealousy that made Mary and Katherine's relationship rocky, but they had been fighting more and more as of late.
</br>
</br>
Katherine stuck out her tongue at Mary before turning back to Alice and Jessica. "Okay, so, like, you guys are finally here! So let's party!" She let out a little squeal of joy. "Sooooo, what do you bitches wanna do first?"
</br>
</br>
Alice took a seat next to Mary and started to speak, but Jessica launched right into her plans. "Girls," she began, "I have just the idea for our weekend here." Jessica's grin was well-known to the group. As the resident fetishist, Jessie often had that grin before she announced some bizarre kink of hers to the rest of the friends.
</br>
</br>
"Oh, yeah?" asked Katherine. She was always excited to hear from Jessica. Katie loved a good fucking, even if she didn't share Jessie's more extreme sex quirks.
</br>
</br>
"I have our plans... right..." Jessica's hand reached down her skirt and into her bikini bottom. Her eyelids fluttered as she found what she was looking for, a happy moan escaping her lips. "...here," she finished. With that, she pulled the vibrator out of her ass and displayed it for all to see. Mary scrunched up her face in disgust while Katherine threw up her hands in celebration.
</br>
</br>
"Damn, girl! I knew you were fucked up!" Katie laughed.
</br>
</br>
Alice waited, head in her hands. Jessica always had a flair for the dramatic. She said a well-told story always made the climax more memorable. That's why foreplay was important, Jessica had often said. Even now, Jessie flicked the pink toy back and forth and shook her head slowly. "This isn't just a vibrator I hid up my ass." The comment was given so calmly that it seemed normal for the girl. <i>Maybe it <b>is</b> normal for her...</i> Alice thought. "This," Jessica continued, "is my mother."
</br>
</br>
The room was silent and a look of confusion crossed both Mary and Katherine's faces. "Your mom is... that toy?" Mary asked incredulously.
</br>
</br>
"That's right. I used this-" Jessica pulled out the portable Chronivac, "-to turn my mom into a vibrator. Then I shoved her up my ass and drove here. As a matter of fact, that's not the only thing I've done with this baby." She flipped up her skirt to reveal her bikini bottom. "This is Steve, ladies. Hot isn't it?"
</br>
</br>
"No fucking way," Katherine breathed.
</br>
</br>
"Yeah, exactly," Mary said. "There is no way that anything could do that. Now get serious so we can decide on where we're going for lunch."
</br>
</br>
Alice kept quiet, knowing that Jessica wanted to handle this her way. "Well, if you don't believe me, than you wouldn't mind if I changed you into something then, right Mary?" she taunted. The shorter girl wasn't listening, she was already putting her book away and rolling her eyes from behind her glasses. "Okay," Jessie muttered, clearly ready to enjoy what was coming next. "Time to turn you into..."</p>
