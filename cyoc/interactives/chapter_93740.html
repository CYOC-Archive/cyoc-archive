<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“About damn time!” Kaecinus said as the orc, dwarf, and horse came back into view, trudging down the dusty path. “What the hell were you two doing?”<br />
<br />
John and Sanin shared a nervous glance. Sanin blushed deeply and looked away. <br />
<br />
“Anyway,” the elf said, “we need to be going. Come along, Jenny. The sun’s setting, we should be back before dark.”<br />
<br />
“What if we get attacked again?” Jenny demanded. “I’m scared.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry yourself about that. I’ll make sure you get back safe and sound,” the elf said, unsheathing his sword. “I’ll make sure of it, everyone in the kingdom will be overjoyed to see you.”<br />
<br />
Jenny crossed her arms and made eye contact with John. “I’d be much happier if John went with me.” A warm smile spread across both their faces. There was certainly a connection between them.<br />
<br />
“Out of the question. You know the Treaty of Haeraldum-Ruudel. Any orc or other fel-creature breaching the 50-step perimeter surrounding the Kingdom of Eleanoris shall be shot at with weaponry.” Kaecinus said, quoting from memory.<br />
<br />
“But-” Jenny began.<br />
<br />
“No buts. Your father, his majesty the king put his seal on that order, and you and I cannot violate it.”<br />
<br />
“That treaty was a farce. Ruudel had no representation at that conference.”<br />
<br />
“Look,” Kaecinus said, throwing his arms up. “I don’t make the laws, your dad does. I just enforce them.”<br />
<br />
“And I’m ordering you not to enforce this one!”<br />
<br />
“You know you can’t do that! Look, it’s getting dark, we need to go! Now!”<br />
<br />
“If I can interrupt,” Sanin blurted out, cutting off their argument. The dwarf hopped down from the horse as they both wheeled around and glared. “Look, lad,” Sanin sighed, addressing Kaecinius. “Your horse is knackered. Hadn’t ye better make camp here for the night, and ye can go whilst the sun’s shinin’?” The mare stood on wobbly legs, her head drooping. Sanin gave her a sympathetic pat.<br />
<br />
“She’s fine,” Kaecinus said. <br />
<br />
“She’s not fine,” Jenny said firmly. “You’re right, sir. We shall recuperate here for the night.”<br />
<br />
“But-” Kaecinus began.<br />
<br />
“No buts.” Jenny cut him off just as he did to her. John nearly cried out with joy at Jenny flipping the script on the elf.  “I spent heaven knows how long in that dungeon, I will take as much fresh air as I can get. We’ll all take turns on guard, and we’ll leave at sunrise.”<br />
<br />
Kaecinus sputtered as Jenny swiftly took the reins and led the mare over towards a tree. After hitching her and removing her gear, she laid down and fell asleep almost immediately. “See?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Kaecinus crossed his arms and harrumphed. “Fine, your highness. We’ll stay here for the night, but we’re leaving at the crack of dawn. Who will stand guard?”<br />
<br />
“I will,” John volunteered. “With my hearing I can hear anything approaching us.”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Kaecinus said with a yawn. “If we’re not going, then I’m hitting the sack. It’s been a long day for me.” John, Sanin, and Jenny all snorted and rolled their eyes. The fact that the elf thought he had the roughest day of the four of them told a lot about his character. “Then, I am serious, we are re going in the morning. Alone,” he said pointedly at the orc and dwarf. “Without the beast and his fuckbuddy,” he muttered. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know that John and Sanin had actually had sex, but the remark made Sanin covered his face in shame. John glared at the elf and smacked his lips in an air-kiss. Kaecinus shuddered and gathered his horse’s two blankets he had brought along. Taking one for himself, he gave the other to the elf princess. He then undressed down to his underwear and wrapped himself in the blanket, off to sleep for the night.<br />
<br />
Jenny offered the blanket to John. “You’ve certainly had a long day. Why don’t you take the first turn sleeping, and I’ll guard. Would you like this? I’ve slept without a blanket for some time, I can go one more night.”<br />
<br />
John smiled. “Thank you, princess. But let’s let Sanin have it. I won’t get cold,” he said, patting the thick skin over his stomach. He handed the blanket to Sanin, who awkwardly thanked John without making eye contact. They were all eager to get some sleep, and within minutes, all but John were under.<br />
<br />
John’s stomach grumbled loudly. It had been nearly a day before he had anything to eat. The last time he ate was with Brian. John frowned. He felt it was wrong to leave Brian trapped in the labyrinth, but if he was under mind control and he was in the body of a minotaur, then it wasn’t really Brian. Or was he still under mind control if the satyr was dead? John shook his head. Too many questions.<br />
<br />
John wandered through the woods, making sure to stay within earshot of the camp. He was still paranoid the satyr would reappear and abduct Jenny. Despite splitting his head in two with his battle axe, John didn’t discount the true power of the magical beast. His face lit up when he found a bush with some large berries on it. He tasted one...blueberry. They were the size of grapes! John uprooted the whole bush with a single tug.<br />
<br />
John had some other business to take care of besides his hunger. Dropping his loincloth, he emptied his bladder for what seemed like a few minutes, leaving a small lake of pungent liquid. He considered emptying his bowels (mostly out of morbid curiosity for what exactly would come out) but he didn’t want to do it so close to the camp. Instead, he carried the bush of berries back to the sleeping men and princess.<br />
<br />
Leaning up against a tree, he stood guard, battle axe close by, snacking on the berries. It wasn’t exactly a lot of variety, but they were filling him up. The sun had now set, and John was getting quite tired himself. He kept himself awake, so he could protect Jenny.<br />
<br />
Jenny, laying down between the two men, stirred and opened her eyes. She glanced up at John, who smiled. “I see you,” he said quietly. <br />
<br />
Jenny smiled back, got up, and walked towards the orc. “I can’t sleep. Too much excitement today.” She embraced John and snuggled into his muscled chest. John hugged her and kissed the top of her head. That was probably a mistake...John grimaced when he realized she hadn’t washed her hair in weeks. “Thank you again for saving my life,” she said to John.<br />
<br />
“It’s nothing,” he said, quietly gagging.<br />
<br />
“That satyr has tormented decent creatures for a long time. I’m glad he’s gone. He’s a scourge upon the people of our kingdom.”<br />
<br />
John chuckled. “A bigger scourge than my people?”<br />
<br />
Jenny slowly broke her embrace with John. “We’ve had our disagreements with the orcs, yes. You really aren’t like any orc I’ve ever met, though.”<br />
<br />
“What can I say. I am a man of refined taste.” John popped another berry into his mouth. “Can I offer you a berry, your highness?”<br />
<br />
Jenny stared at the berry. “Those...those are poisonous!” She exclaimed. “How many have you eaten!?”<br />
<br />
“What?!” John jumped in the air and began spitting out remnants of berry. “Like ten or twenty. Am I going to die?!” John asked, panicking. He crouched, putting his head down between his knees, and spit a few times.<br />
<br />
Jenny burst out with laughter. “No. I’m kidding.”<br />
<br />
John sighed in relief, stood up, and crossed his arms. “I should have known. That what I get for eating vegetarian.” Ordinarily John would be extremely annoyed at someone for tricking him like that, but Jenny could have cut his arms off and he wouldn&#39;t have minded.<br />
<br />
“Like I said, you’re a unique orc,&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I wish I could get to know you more before I have to go back to my kingdom,&quot; she said sadly.<br />
<br />
John smiled. “We’ve got time, yet. And I want to know more about you, princess. You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.”<br />
<br />
“Tell you what. Where’s that rope that Kaecinus was tied up with?”<br />
<br />
“Over here,” John said, walking over to fetch it. “Whoa, wait, what do you plan on doing with this?” he asked, handing the cut rope over.<br />
<br />
Jenny giggled. “Nothing like that,” she said. “I’m going to try something. I’m a bit rusty at magic, but let me take a crack at this.” <br />
<br />
“Magic?” John quietly asked. Jenny hadn’t made any indication that there was anything supernatural about her.<br />
<br />
Jenny concentrated on the rope, which began to glow blue, just like when the satyr had conjured it. John’s jaw dropped as the rope stretched in both directions, growing a few feet per second. Jenny’s eyes glowed blue as the rope twisted at its ends, tying itself in knots while continuing to grow. The rope twisted over itself several times over in a cross-hatch pattern, filling in a solid surface. After a few more seconds, Jenny’s work with the rope was complete. “What do you think about that?” she asked, holding up the hammock she had created. “You’ve earned a comfortable place to sleep tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Incredible,” John said. “Can it support both our weights?” he asked slyly.<br />
<br />
“It sure can,” she said, wrapping her arms around him once again and planting a delicate kiss on his chest.</p>
