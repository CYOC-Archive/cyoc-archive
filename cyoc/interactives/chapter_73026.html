<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well,&quot; you say, riled and aroused, &quot;I'm game, even if you aren't, Joy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; she says, smiling broadly. &quot;I just need to run out and grab our standard waiver form for such <br />
encounters. I'll be right back.&quot; She smiles, looking you up and down one more time, then grabs the front of <br />
your shirt to pull you down into a kiss. &quot;Don't go anywhere, sport..&quot; She sashays out, glancing back over her <br />
shoulder to give you another stare before leaving the room.<br />
<br />
The moment the door shuts, Anna quietly speaks to you. &quot;Listen to me, pretty boy..&quot; she says in a <br />
conspiratorial tone, &quot;We don't have much time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, what?&quot; you ask, very confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;This zoo..it's a prison for anyone with a mind of their own. I need you to help me escape. It might be your <br />
only chance as well,&quot; she tells you, her face unreadable.<br />
<br />
&quot;My only chance?&quot; You ask her, feeling a little frightened of how urgent her tone is.<br />
<br />
Anna nods. &quot;Yes. This zoo..and almost all of its exhibits in the cryptozoology wing in particular..they once <br />
used to be normal humans..with fetishes. This is how the zoo keeps its wings stocked. They hold 'VIP <br />
Nights'..and if someone seems to be more..attuned to such things, they're given a 'special opportunity' to <br />
have an intimate encounter. The zoo's intention is for these encounters to lead to infection..at which point <br />
they keep the newly turned patrons as exhibits. Sometimes they cull the older ones, other times they're <br />
shipped elsewhere, or used for pure experimentation purposes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your stomach knots up. It made sense, as there was nobody locally who knew of your fetish. The only people who <br />
might would have been online friends..whose identities you'd never be able to verify. How you even got such a <br />
special invite was a total mystery.<br />
<br />
&quot;So..couldn't you just..NOT infect me?&quot; you ask almost sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The zoo...has methods..of control,&quot; Anna replied. &quot;That panel..the one with the dial for the lights..setting <br />
five is the one you saw used during my transformation. At that level, it perfectly replicates the experience <br />
of me being exposed to the full moon.Even after my transformation, I retain a certain amount of my human <br />
intellect and control over my actions. You'll notice that it goes up to level ten, however. Level ten..would <br />
be the equivalent of me actually standing on the moon. That..level of intensity..obliterates my self <br />
control..and drives me into a state of hyper infectiousness. I wouldn't be able to stop my instincts..and as a <br />
werewolf..the prime drive is to infect, unless I'm hungry. It's how the species and the virus that first <br />
created us propagates normally. If you come into the enclosure with me..she'll either turn the lights up <br />
higher while we fuck, or afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are..are you sure?&quot; You ask. &quot;Joy seemed well, quite nice, really...I mean..she doesn't SEEM evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna sighed. &quot;Whether she is or is not evil, that's not the point. She follows orders. And it's quite easy for <br />
you to say she's not evil..you're not the one who's been imprisoned here for years.&quot; She stared at you, <br />
putting her hand on the plexiglass, her eyes pleading. &quot;Please....help me..&quot;<br />
<br />
You put your hand up on the opposite side of the glass, feeling an undeniable sympathy for her. &quot;How do I help <br />
you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna's eyes glittered with a moment of tears. &quot;Thank you..&quot; she whispered, blinking them away a moment later. <br />
&quot;The door has a failsafe. It can't be opened from the inside under any circumstance. When she opens the door <br />
for you, push her in and shut the door. She won't be expecting it. I'll take care of the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you gonna kill her?&quot; It was a fair question, and it was one that made you uneasy. You weren't sure at all <br />
about Joy being evil, or even an agent of evil.<br />
<br />
Anna shook her head. &quot;No. I plan to infect her. In the worst case scenario, even if the plan doesn't work, she <br />
will lose her freedom. In the ideal circumstance..&quot; Anna stopped. &quot;She's at the door, act natural. I'll <br />
explain more once I have her.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded, knowing you were now in a situation that was rapidly approaching point of no return. You were <br />
definitely on the verge of being completely in over your head and committing at least one felony, if not more.<br />
<br />
Joy walked back in with a smile, holding a stack of papers, all stapled. &quot;You ready?&quot; she asked with a grin, <br />
her nipples rock hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;I still can't believe this is legit,&quot; you say, trying to sound casual. &quot;I mean..seriously, I thought <br />
werewolves were just a movie thing..and now I'm getting to fuck one..this is the most awesome night of my <br />
life!&quot; Joy grinned and handed you the stack of paperwork. Its printing was so small and dense, full of <br />
legalese that you'd have spent hours upon hours if you tried to read it all, let alone comprehend it. <br />
&quot;Man..this is like the Apple ToS,&quot; you joke as you take the offered pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just standard boilerplate stuff,&quot; Joy tells you. &quot;No recording devices, no photography, you can't make money <br />
from telling your story, hold harmless waiver, that kinda stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; you reply, almost amused that she mentioned a hold harmless waiver..which was something that would <br />
only apply to someone being injured. It took a certain amount of balls to mention the notion of injury to <br />
someone when the injury would result in lycanthropy. You pretend not to notice, scribbling an illegible <br />
signature at the bottom of the page.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Joy said, taking the papers from your hand. &quot;Let me just unlock the door. Anna, you know protocol. Go <br />
have a seat on the couch.&quot; Anna nodded, slipping the robe off and laying down on the couch seductively, <br />
playing her role as the eager woman. Joy escorted you to the door, and you saw her punch a series of numbers <br />
into the electronic keypad, noting it was 848412. She stepped aside, ushering you in. You stood in the <br />
doorway, not quite stepping through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I get one last kiss?&quot; you ask. She stepped closer to you, and as you pulled her to you for the kiss, <br />
you grabbed her shoulders firmly and then spun her into the room, pushing her hard and shutting the door.<br />
<br />
Joy's eyes opened in a wide and panicked alarm. &quot;No! Let me out!&quot; She began to hammer on the glass as Anna <br />
stood up, slowly stalking over to the petite blonde with a definite predatory grin. &quot;Please! Please let me <br />
out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter, Joy?&quot; Anna asked with a teasing tone, &quot;I thought you liked werewolves. What..not so <br />
comfortable being in the cage with one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna..I've..I've always been nice to you..&quot; Joy said, her hands up in the air, backing away until she was <br />
against the wall. &quot;OH GOD, OPEN THE DOOR!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have been many things to me, Joy..cordial, friendly...polite...but still..I need my freedom..something <br />
you've never given me, even when I'd begged,&quot; Anna said, her voice soft and relatively free of malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You..you know I can't do that!&quot; Joy said, sniffling as she started to cry. &quot;Oh god..please..PLEASE..open the <br />
door!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna looked over at you. &quot;Turn on the lights..it's the largest dial. Setting five.&quot; She stalked to Joy, <br />
grabbing her wrists and pinning her against the wall. &quot;Don't worry..I have no intention of killing you. I'm <br />
simply going to give you what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Joy begged. &quot;Please...I have a life outside these walls!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you think I didn't..before I was infected and turned?&quot; Anna asked, repeating louder. &quot;Turn on the <br />
lights..setting five.&quot; Joy whimpered softly, no longer really resisting. Anna relaxed her grip,seeming to no <br />
longer enjoy the terror on the girl's face. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; Anna told her, stroking her cheek. &quot;Once you're <br />
turned...we're getting out of here. I won't leave you to the same fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Joy said, even smiling for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise,&quot; Anna said. &quot;Now..take off your clothes. I want this to be as enjoyable for you as possible, <br />
alright?&quot; Joy nodded, blushing as she peeled her clothing off and tugged her hair out of its ponytail.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've never done this before..&quot; she said, sounding very much like a virgin on her wedding night.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine..&quot; Anna said, &quot;I've had a bit of experience with moonlit encounters of both varieties.&quot; She led <br />
Joy by the hand to the center of the room and turned to face you. &quot;One more time, friend..turn the lights to <br />
setting five.&quot;</p>
