<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juanita finished chewing her bubblegum, pulling it forcefully from her mouth. She stuck it on the floor then stepped back. In a flash, the wad of gum quickly morphed into a human being, huddled on the floor in her panties, only. She covered up, the glared at Juanita. Juanita just smirked then snapped her fingers. Two men came over with a blanket, then covered the girl before cuffing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I just love it when they run.&quot; Juanita laughed in her silky latin accent. She tied her curly dark hair into a ponytail before placing her hat back on. &quot;Sorry honey, but maybe that&#39;ll teach you for turning people into statues huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was temporary! It was just a scam alright?&quot; She growled, trying to use her powers to no avail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try, this place has a TON of enchantments to stop your kind of chaos. And as for temporary, tell that to poor Eliza who shattered on the way to the man you sold her to. Take her away boys.&quot; She finished with a tight tone.<br />
<br />
As the men took her off, Juanita smiled. She then walked back over to the nearest desk to her where a meek nerdy girl sat. She&#39;d be a mostly unassuming, nerdy brunette if it wasn&#39;t for her obvious bunny ears.<br />
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be doing that you know.&quot; She whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw come on hun, you gonna tattle on me now?&quot; Juanita giggled with a wink.<br />
<br />
The girl blushed hard, fixing her glasses. &quot;St-stop it Juanita. You&#39;re married now!&quot; She stuttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know Alana, but I just love seeing your little cottontail shake.&quot; She smiled.<br />
<br />
Alana blushed, clutching her tail before putting on a somewhat straight face.<br />
&quot;Ugh, telling you I was gay was a mistake. That&#39;s the last time I let you take us all out to party and have tequila.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, last time this week.&quot; Juanita quipped. She then turned her head back towards the four women who walked by her towards the chief&#39;s office. &quot;Woof, so that was SWAT team T right?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? O-oh yeah, they&#39;re the last team to return, but that&#39;s everyone accounted for now. Isn&#39;t that great!&quot; Alana added, relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot; Juanita sighed. &quot;But that asshole is still out there, handing out dangerous items and powers to innocent people, kids even.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not ideal huh.&quot; Alana sighed. &quot;Oh, um, speaking of not ideal, you might be a little upset about your mission today.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Juanita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taking the new guy with you today. Ummm, George Jones.&quot; Alana added, riffling through her work for today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, of course I get the new guy, again! Just because I&#39;m good at helping newbies doesn&#39;t mean I WANT to do it.&quot; She sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well sorry Juanita, if you have a problem, you know who you gotta take it up with.&quot; She apologized, pointing towards the Dragon statue.<br />
<br />
Juanita huffed. &quot;Fine, I&#39;d better get going.&quot; She said without taking her eyes off the statue. She looked down, smiled again and gave Alana a wink. &quot;See you cutie hop, oops, I meant cop.&quot; She teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up!&quot; Alana chuckled feeling flustered again as she grabbed her ears down to block her eyes as Juanita walked off.<br />
<br />

<br />
George sat in the car, eager to get started. He never would&#39;ve pictured himself in this job in a million years, especially since he didn&#39;t even know it freaking existed until a few years ago. He grabbed a necklace he wore, breathing a slow sigh out to calm himself. Ever since that day, he knew this&#39;d what he&#39;d want to do.<br />
<br />
*click* SLAM <br />
<br />
George jumped as Juanita quickly entered the car, hopping into the passenger seat with a smile.<br />
&quot;Hey rookie.&quot; She said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh, hello.&quot; He greeted, taken aback by the gorgeous woman before him. &quot;I-I&#39;m George.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, Jones right? I think they might have put us together on account of our names, Smith and Jones you know?&quot; She joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh, you think?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not, the Dragon usually has reasons.&quot; She shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;The what? Wait di-&quot; He began before Juanita interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for rookie? We got an assignment to get to!&quot; She yelled, not sternly but enough to cause George to jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right!&quot; He replied. &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; He agreed before driving off.<br />
<br />
Their car from the outside looked like a generically shaped car with shining material lining the outside. As they approached a brick wall, two frogs on either side face the car, then their eyes glowed. An exit way fit for their car appeared from thin air, allowing for their car to exit. As it exited, the material transformed, and the car&#39;s shape altered. Before they knew it it was changed to look like the police car of the local police force.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I did this a bunch in practice, but doing ti for real is... thrilling.&quot; George chuckled, gazing at the forests and mountains that now surrounded them. &quot;Where are we?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, let&#39;s see.&quot; Juanita muttered, opening her cellphone. &quot;G.P.S. says we&#39;re in the Catskills, New York State.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I, okay.&quot; George muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Juanita asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just figured you&#39;d use... magic&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feh, magic&#39;s done enough in this world. How many lives have been ruined without any reason?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough... that&#39;s why I joined you know.&quot; George said. &quot;My family was just having a damned picnic, and before we know it a hypnosis based transformer showed up. He made my parents think they were geese, and they stripped naked and began to swim in the pond as they slowly grew feathers. Before I knew it my younger brother began to morph into a fire hydrant as I began to shrink. No idea what I was gonna become, but thankfully some M.P.D. people showed up and saved us. before it became irreversible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Samn, sorry kid.&quot; Juanita apologized softly. &quot;Oh, turn left.&quot;  She added.<br />
<br />
As George turned he sighed with a smirk. &quot;It&#39;s okay, my family forgot it all, willingly, but I wanted to remember... I wanted to help, you know? What about you?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? Ha! Well I wasn&#39;t so lucky. I was a normal guy, 28 years old in an accounting gig.&quot; She started. &quot;Oh turn right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... seriously?&quot; George asked in disbelief at the hot woman before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, and white too. But, a reality warping notebook ended up in the office one day, and landed in the hands of some petty intern from down a couple levels. She apparently took revenge on everyone in the lower levels, though I couldn&#39;t tell you how since, you know, the world was altered. Anyway, typical stuff, she got power hungry, began changing everyone randomly, next thing I knew I was sitting in a hospital cot with dark, baby hands coming from my body.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; George gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I had a new family, and started life over as a baby girl in an immigrant family. The M.P.D. showed up when I was 15, finally getting through the majority of the changes the notebook had made. I was apparently &#39;low priority&#39; for them. Thankfully, by then, I was okay with my life. I had grown up feeling no dysphoria, dating a hot guy, knowing two languages now, even working towards law enforcement, ironically, which is WAY better than a crappy desk job. I told them I wanted to stay as Juanita, not John... and they let me, and left their card.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So then you joined when you were old enough.&quot; George finished for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, but hey, I&#39;m helping making a difference now you know?&quot; She smiled. &quot;And I love who I am.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s great at least.&quot; George smiled back. &quot;Man, reality changers are serious beasts all together huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got no idea.&quot; Juanita laughed. &quot;Some are so crazy the best solution is to just ignore it. Like, you know Monday used to be the first day of the work week, not Wednesday?&quot; She asked. &quot;Oh, right turn here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up.&quot; George gasped. Do you remember how it was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I only know about that cause the super higher ups always apologize cause they mess up dates sometimes. The other ones I hear are just rumors, like humans and Dairy cows once having had each other&#39;s roles, diapers used to be for everyone, and apparently that guys used to be the ones who asked women out first.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Imagine that? My man Andre NEVER would have had the tits to ask me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeesh, I couldn&#39;t picture it... w-wait, what was that first one?&quot; He stuttered before being interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! We&#39;re here!&quot; Juanita suddenly interrupted. &quot;Alright, time to find the anomalous person and or item, then bring them in. Now they don&#39;t know we&#39;re coming, so our protective spells should keep us immune to the effects, but not forever so we gotta find this quick as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, and this is?&quot; George asked as he put the car in park, staring at the location.<br />
<br />
Juanita checked the documents in the dashboard. &quot;Ha, figures this&#39;d be a rookie mission, it&#39;s....&quot; </p>
