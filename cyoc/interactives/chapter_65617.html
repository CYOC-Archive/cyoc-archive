<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And it gets worse,&quot; Patten gave a grumbling sigh after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; I turned back toward him.<br />
<br />
&quot;The board has the power to review all security camera images for the purposes of making sure no one breaks the rules or school policy,&quot; Patten answered, &quot;but because of people's rights to privacy, we can only do when there has been a complaint, or legitimate suspicion that wrong doing has occurred.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm that Hireman's position of leadership over the school board allows him to make that decision,&quot; I answered, &quot;he's been in Beauregard's pocket since the beginning and has been trying to go after Molly... but since Williams was fired here and Mrs. Fitzpatrick took his place, and Molly was then promoted and given official certification as a teacher and protected by the state's teacher's union, direct attacks on her are more difficult. So, he'll declare legitimate suspicion exists against me to justify looking for me to make a mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Patten sighed, &quot;but there is nothing that can be done... at least nothing that can be done that will end well. The attack can be blunted and Mrs. Choir's campaign can continue and the attack can be rendered useless... but doing so would betray that girl's privacy as well as implicate Hireman and the board for revealing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's why I think his game has changed,&quot; Patten continued, &quot;He's had to have seen the polls too. He knows that Mrs. Choir is beginning to take a firm lead. This attack probably won't help him win... but it could still have dramatic consequences...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dragging the whole school board with him, as you said,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
Patten nodded, &quot;and while Mrs. Choir and a whole new and inexperienced board might do well... the odds would be against them... which would mean that if something goes wrong and they fail... Hireman could come in again at the end of the next term, claim, &quot;I told you so&quot; and regain his seat with a whole new board. One that may either agree with him or isn't as fed up with his racist attitudes...&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed heavily, as things didn't seem entirely good. In the present race, Tabby probably would win. It seemed that Patten wouldn't betray Amy's privacy to counter Hireman's political attack, but I didn't know about the other School Board Members would do the same. What was coming because of this would be nothing but chaos.<br />
<br />
&quot;There must be something that can be done...&quot; I spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing can be done,&quot; Patten answered, &quot;nothing that doesn't ruin that girl's privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you could talk to her,&quot; I commented, &quot;tell her what Hireman has done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might work... but only if she then believes that the betrayal is from Hireman and not from you or from the school board as a whole,&quot; Patten sighed, &quot;as said, this attack will bring chaos on many levels.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I felt there was something that had to be done. Left alone the attack could hurt Tabby's chances to win the election and Molly would have to put up with Hireman's attempts to fire her for another term. If the full truth of the attack was revealed, it would betray Amy's privacy and bring chaos on the school system. It could hurt Patten's hopes for reelection when his term ends in the future, and because he was helping Tabby could hurt her now because of the connection. In fact the newspaper's coverage of the debate seemed to lean in that way. But that wasn't the limit of the potential consequences, though they wouldn't be political ones. If Amy herself came out of the &quot;closet&quot; and explained things, while she would politically nullify Hireman's attack, she would expose herself and face a ton of personal trouble.<br />
<br />
All of the options was potentially dangerous, but I knew something had to be done. And as I made my way into work the next morning my mind dwelt on it. I couldn't let Tabby just sit and take the attack's affects from Hireman. At the same time, I couldn't betray Amy's own trust. I may not be a counselor, but I wasn't about to just drag a teenager's trust through the mud. I felt I'd at least let Amy know what Hireman had done and let her go from there. I'd promise her that Molly and I would support her decision, whether it was to continue on as a homosexual woman with Marcella, become a heterosexual male cat of her breed of choice with Marcella. Whatever her choice, she would have our support, regardless of her choices.<br />
<br />
My thoughts however were so think that I almost didn't respond to Officer Barnes as we met outside the office we had operated out of.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, George?&quot; Officer Barnes asked, finally getting my attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh... oh, yeah, I'm okay,&quot; I nodded, &quot;Just thinking over some problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Problems?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Related to last night's debate?&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Officer Barnes wondered, &quot;Megan had come across something on Animal Planet she wanted us to tape for her. Officer Jenkins ended up spending much of the evening figuring out how the DVD burner worked and then watching the program with her. Very good, by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On the points of policy, I think Tabby won,&quot; I answered, &quot;but Hireman has come out with a new attack... similar to the first one he pulled, but one that will cause a ton of trouble for Tabby and for the School Board as it is as a whole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What'd he do?&quot; Officer Barnes gave a groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember the conversation we had with the teen, Amy, her first name is?&quot; I asked back.<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hireman has pulled some strings to legally view the security camera footage from the office and has used it as part of his latest charge to accuse me of corrupting you and trying to turn Columbia Falls into some sort of Animal Kingdom as it were,&quot; I explained, &quot;if we tell the truth about that meeting, we will betray Amy's trust and expose her. If we do nothing, Hireman will use the add to either win the election now, or destroy the School Board as it exists, almost dooming Tabby to failure and allowing him to come in later and take his job back. And if Amy comes out herself... she'll kill Hireman's attack but could face further ostracism... either for being homosexual or considering becoming an Animal Person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are times when I'd be willing to look the other way and let you maul that man,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;if he did that, he's going after the girl more then he is you and me. You and I, George, we can take it. The truth will prove that we've done nothing legally wrong, and we can defend ourselves. She can't. Shoot... she's got all the &quot;culture warriors&quot; in the GOP against her already... and the lunatics like Perry have already voiced their support of policies against Animal People similar to what Beauregard did. He's attacking a teenager whose road of life is already a tough one...&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes sighed, &quot;but that wouldn't be right. All it'd do is prove him right that you're dangerous and I'm corrupt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that he'd likely taste nasty,&quot; I forced a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes chuckled a little bit, &quot;I'm sure. So what do you plan to do? I can see that your gears are ticking...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least to tell Amy what Hireman has done,&quot; I sighed, &quot;Let her know that we didn't betray her trust. And that she has mine and Molly's support.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Jenkins and I will support her too,&quot; Officer Barnes replied.<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;Thanks. I'll let her know that, if I see her.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In regards to the work, the day went quietly. Though some of it seemed like a quiet before the storm. Hireman's latest attack had only just come out, and much of the intended audience missed it because of the Volleyball game going on the same night. In theory, that might actually help. If fewer people saw the attack, fewer people might actually believe it. But I wasn't about to let things go so far as to truly go bad.<br />
<br />
I had to let Amy know what Hireman had done, feeling it was better from me then from someone who would use it to cause needless pain. And since things were quiet, I took the opportunity to do what I could to see if Amy was around. With no warrant or other legal reason, I couldn't have her called to the office, or physically go door to door. That would be disruptive and outside of the basic purposes of the warning I had to give. And while the school's policy didn't actually prohibit me from patrolling the halls, it probably wasn't something that the office staff saw as favorable. <br />
<br />
So my searching was largely limited to going out every hour to the watering fountain near the DARE office. The watering fountain was in a spot where I could look to the student center near it, and I hoped that Amy would be there. An entirely private conversation would probably be out of the question, but I figured it would be better then nothing. It would allow me to at least give her the warning about what Hireman was doing. For much of the day, I wasn't all that lucky in that regard. It wasn't until close to lunch time that I did spot there.<br />
<br />
She was seated at a table with Marcella and at least two other teens, and from what I could tell she was eating. Interrupting their lunch wasn't something I wanted to do, but I felt I had to give Amy the warning. And so I slowly made my way toward the table where she was seated. It was one of the other girls that noticed me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-oh... someone's in trouble,&quot; the girl commented to her neighbor.<br />
<br />
That got Amy and Marcella to both turn their heads in my direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one is in trouble,&quot; I answered the teen that had spoken, &quot;at least no one is with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again, Officer Wayne,&quot; Amy spoke politely, &quot;these are my friends Sally and Julie... and my BEST friend Marcella.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've met,&quot; Marcella told her, &quot;I trust I'm more &quot;appropriately&quot; attired now?&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly glanced and nodded. Marcella was wearing a plain tee-shirt and a pair of shorts. They covered more the bikini bottoms did, though there were some things that seemed to indicate that the cotton and artificial fibers itched her fur a little. And the fact that as a long haired breed, a Maine Coon's fur probably didn't make that situation easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I gave a nod, and a chuckle, &quot;how does it feel though with the long fur?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It itches a bit,&quot; Marcella sighed, &quot;Though the bikini bottoms actually itched more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silk might be the better fabric,&quot; I told her, &quot;It won't irritate your fur as much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It irritates your fur?&quot; Julie asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of it like wearing a stocking cap for awhile,&quot; I told her, &quot;a lot of cloth fibers make fur itch. Silks do not appear to itch as much. The Hindu couple Rathik and Mugdha own a silk shop in town. If you have the money for it... or if your parents will help you, they should be able to make some clothing for you that won't itch as much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Marcella answered, &quot;I might give them a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is your uniform silk?&quot; Sally wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, and it itches like crazy,&quot; I answered, &quot;but silk is fairly expensive and my work can be fairly rough and tumble... my uniform is standard issue if scaled up to fit my size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think about his size, Marcella?&quot; Julie asked to Marcella in a teasing voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it's as big as the rest of him is,&quot; Marcella answered, &quot;but he's older then us and he's married. The &quot;Tiger-Lady&quot; is his wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to dive into that I sighed and tried to come to the point of why I was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could the two of you move along for a few moments, I have some rather delicate business to deal with with Amy and Marcella?&quot; I asked toward Sally and Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not in trouble? Are they?&quot; Julie wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Sally shrugged, &quot;we've finished our lunch anyway. Let's go get a pop from the vending machine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then left and went to a vending machine at the other end of the student center, where there was already a fair sized line. I then turned back to Amy and Marcella. Marcella had a sack lunch with what smelled like fish to me. Which was probably appropriate. People would probably freak out if she decided to bring mice in to eat, just as they'd fear Molly and I if we brought one of the kills we'd made during the hunting season in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love her,&quot; Marcella answered as I turned my head to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've guessed much from what Amy has told me,&quot; I answered, &quot;you've made quite a personal sacrifice for it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't you do the same for your wife?&quot; Marcella asked.<br />
<br />
I slowly nodded and sighed. I probably would.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you understand?&quot; Marcella continued, almost as if she was moving to defend Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand your reasoning, and to be honest, the both of you will have my support and my wife's,&quot; I spoke, &quot;though, your adding of Maine Coon DNA has complicated your relationship...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The instinctual thing...&quot; Marcella sighed looking down, &quot;I didn't think it'd be as strong as it is...&quot; she paused for a moment, &quot;Amy's told me you and your partner have an idea to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; I sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd be your tomcat...&quot; Amy whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd become male for me?&quot; Marcella asked, her voice low.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're still straight, Marcella,&quot; Amy whispered again, &quot;I love you as a female... and your very cute as a cat... but as I am... I'll never have what you want... not biologically anyway. As a male cat... all those problems would be gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcella blinked, scooted closer to Amy, and rubbed her head to Amy's. She purred as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is, however, the reason I am here,&quot; I spoke, pulling them out of what appeared to be a special moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A problem,&quot; I sighed, &quot;the School District Superintendent got his hands on the security camera footage from your visit to our office, Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcella hissed at the mention of Hireman's title.<br />
<br />
&quot;He...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's used it as his latest attack against Tabitha Choir in present election,&quot; I continued, &quot;but he's cut out everything but the end where Officer Barnes and I offered the suggestion of using the Animatrix Serum. To make it seem like I want to turn everyone into Animal People.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Molly have stated repeatedly that you're against the distribution of the Animatrix Serum,&quot; Marcella pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't stop a racist politician from making a low blow,&quot; I answered, &quot;and that is precisely what Hireman did was. It may not help him win this election, but it is likely already spreading chaos through the system.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want us to help beat him?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The method to beat the attack is already possible,&quot; I sighed, &quot;but without your help, using it would probably bring down the entire school board and could end Tabby's campaign.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid racist,&quot; Marcella hissed, likely referring to Hireman.<br />
<br />
&quot;My help?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only way to avoid political ramifications would be for you to make a statement, explaining your situation and your relationship with Marcella, here,&quot; I whispered, &quot;it would demonstrate the facts that Hireman was twisting things in a desperate attempt to get in a cheap blow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She'd have to announce that she's gay...&quot; Marcella spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Essentially,&quot; I nodded, &quot;which could give you both personal issues to deal with... at least until Amy becomes male, and the gay or straight issue is no longer an issue. It's why I'm telling you this now, Miss Amy. To let you know what is happening and to assure you that Officer Barnes and I are behind you. And we will support you both, no matter what you decide to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who would I talk to to do this?&quot; Amy asked after a moment, &quot;Make this statement?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd urge you to think it over,&quot; I spoke, &quot;If you're truly willing... talk with Joseph Patten.&quot;</p>
