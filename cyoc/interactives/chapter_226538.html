<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Koala fury called Lankey moaned in contentment as he rested on forest floor. His rear end leaking of his companion’s seed after it was just deposited in his rectum. His real name Adam Greybear; Greybear being his family’s new name, but he still preferred to be called Lankey. His companion was his best friend/lover Slag; a Copperhead fury, both were gay prior to becoming furies. Now they looked at females the same way they looked at each other; but at the end of the day, both would rather bed each other and wake up the next morning in each other’s embrace.<br />
<br />
“No keep spooning me,” Lankey moaning as he felt Slag get up; the feel of his reptilian body was sensual to Lankey’s fur and he wanted to continue to feel it as he laid there on the forest floor.<br />
“Can’t help it,” Slag taking a few step back before turning around; “I need to pee.”<br />
“Then let me watch,” Lankey getting up; “your cloaca always fascinates me.”<br />
“And I like how your furry balls swing and slap when you are back dooring me,” Slag flicking his forked tongue out; sampling the air like a normal copperhead snake would when hunting for food.<br />
<br />
Slag standing with his legs slightly parted as he relaxes his bladder. The sight of his reptilian prick just peeking out of the horizontal vent in front of his crotch to spray the forest with his water made Lankey feel hard as his marsupial like member starts rising from his sheath.<br />
“You going to bend over when done,” Lankey whispering in his lover’s ear; “I do believe it’s my turn for a little fun.” Lankey doesn’t let Slag answer as he starts cupping his partner’s crotch; not bothering to wait for him to finish as he gets a bit of Slag’s urine on his hand paw.<br />
“You’ll get your fun later,” Slag gently removing his lover’s paw from his crotch; “but I would like to get some breakfast first. You think we can score some pancakes at your parents place?”<br />
“Just along as you don’t mind my sisters trying do kinky shit with you and a bottle of syrup,” Lankey feeling his arousal fade from being denied a little morning pork.<br />
<br />
“I have no problem with them wanting to try an eat me out,” Slag turning around to look at the Koala fury; his tongue continuing to flick in and out. “Just so they know that it won’t get them to stake me as their mate,” Stag leaning in for a kiss; “I don’t care what primal urge to reproduce may drive us, your my lover and that’s final.”<br />
Lankey crooned at the last of those words as he accepted the kiss from the copperhead fury; exchanging saliva as their tongues dance in each other’s mouths. Pulling back Lankey smiles as Slag nods before a dull thud could be heard and Slag’s expression goes from happy to shock. Taking a step back he looks down to see a hole just under his sternum and blood pooling from it.<br />
<br />
“Wha….” Was all Slag could get out before he fell; his legs giving out from under him as begins to gasp.<br />
“Slag!” Lankey looking stunned as he tries to help; but soon falls to the forest floor as well. He never heard the shot as a bullet tears through his head killing him instantly.<br />
<br />
Stepping out from the brush a duo of men in camo-fatigues and wielding high powered rifles with silencers approach.<br />
“This one is still alive,” One man speaking as he looks at the copperhead fury struggling to breath; seeing as the blood is pooling in his lungs, it won’t be long before he drowns in his own fluids or dies from blood loss. “Not taking a chance,” the man lowering his rifle and aiming point blank at the fury’s head. A load thud could be heard as the bullet tears through Slag’s skull killing him instantly.<br />
“That’s two furies dead,” the second man smiling; “you think they came from the town were that bitch who destroyed the world lives?”<br />
“Occam&#39;s razor would assume so,” the first man looking at a set of GPS co-ordinates keyed in on a device attached to his wrist; “it’s a twenty minute walk due south from here. Don’t remove that silencer and we’ll get a few more.”<br />
“Freaks don’t stay silent went they are fucking each other,” the second man checking his ammo and nodding at what he has; “makes it easy to sneak up and pop them.”<br />
“Just keep your head on a swivel,” the first man scanning the forest before stepping over the corpses; “there are most likely more here, and they could be waking up from their evening’s romp.”<br />
<br />
***************<br />
<br />
In town, Henry Knotlock returned to his home after getting a few items from the grocery store. He sighed as it was technically his dad’s home; but seeing as his father ran out on him and his mother back when Henry was ten, Henry wondered if the deadbeat dad lost all rights to the place. For the past six years it was him and his mother living here. Having to take care of her as she became house bound due to her extreme morbid obesity; he came home after becoming a Doberman fury thinking the gift would help her. So when he and the green Parakeet fury named Elly arrived, he asked her to put up her glamor as before they entered and warned her of his mother’s condition. This was to keep her from freaking out as few knew of how messed up Henry’s mother became after her husband just one day left them high and dry.<br />
<br />
Stepping inside of the house to see the sofa empty, Henry shook his head as he wiped his paws on the mat before entering the kitchen. He remembered when he ready his mother’s meal as well as her medicines that day; putting in some of his infectious fluids into the meal before serving it to her. She made the usual pleasant conversation regarding his school day; Henry as usual lied telling her it was fine; not letting her know as usual that he cut class again, or that Officer Luis Whitefur caught him for truancy and possession of a controlled substance; he was drinking mescaline. Getting let off with a warning and pressed to acting as a deputy to keep humans from escaping town.<br />
<br />
So when he saw his mother starting to choke and clutch her chest when she should have been turning into a fury, Henry was looking fraught with concern as he let his glamor fell and called the only person he thought could help. He called Deputy Whitefur; the deputy arriving minutes later only to shake his head as he observed Henry being comforted by a female green feathered Parakeet fury. There was nothing he could do for the obese woman as she clearly had a heart attack. She would not be the first in town to die from being given the fury virus.<br />
“I’m all alone,” Henry crying as he watched the fire department now furies use their runes to make a large enough hole in the wall to haul the large corpse out. It was very undignified as she had to be hauled away to the morgue in a pickup truck with a tarp covering her up.<br />
“I’m sure your father will return,” Elly trying to comfort the Doberman fury; not knowing that the man in question hasn’t been around some time.<br />
<br />
Shaking himself out of the sad memories, Henry started putting the groceries away as he got the stove going and was cooking up some bacon to go with the eggs he just bought. The smell of grease eventually got Elly to crawl out of bed and she half dragged herself to the kitchen.<br />
“Morning,” Elly speaking as she sits at the table; “I missed you this morning.”<br />
“I had to get some groceries,” Henry sighing; cracking the eggs into the pan, he lets them cook in between the bacon as he stares at the pan not sure what to say.<br />
“You still blame yourself don’t you,” Elly looking at the Doberman fury as he picks at the eggs dancing in the skillet; “you had no idea that our gift killed her.”<br />
“But she died all the same,” Henry barking back; “every day I see that sofa empty.” Henry tearing up as he grabs a chair to sit down, “I killed her,” Henry placing his hand paws to his muzzle; “my desire to make her like us, thinking it would make her better, shed the fat that was killing her slowly each day. Fix her mind,” Henry crying; “but she died. Magic can’t bring back the dead,” Henry looking at the runes on his wrist and seeing nothing happen.<br />
<br />
“But it can keep breakfast from burning,” Elly getting up to remove the skillet from the stove and placing it on the table; her runes glowing as she introduced a small cushion of air between the bacon-egg combination and the hot pan.<br />
“Not a bad trick,” Henry looking at Elly as she got some plates.<br />
“You want to wake up my sister and Rudolph or shall I,” Elly seeing Henry getting a napkin to wipe his eyes.<br />
“I’ll do it,” Henry getting up; “it’s about time Pus get is ass out of bed and out of your older sister’s cunt.”<br />
“Crude,” Elly rolling her eyes in disgust as she places the plates on the table.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
In a neighboring bedroom, a cardinal fury was sleeping peacefully next to a mute swan fury; her white plumage to his deep red as she twitched while sleeping. Black scaly arms wrapped around her as Rudolph spooned her from behind.<br />
Henry stared at the two as they slept; surprised that the smell of bacon didn’t rouse them from their slumber. Taking the cup of water he had in his hand paw he pours it over the cardinal fury causing him to sputter as he was so rudely awoken.<br />
“What the fuck is your problem Scabs,” Rudolph  swearing as his sudden movements also woke Penny from her slumber.<br />
“Breakfast is ready,” the Doberman answering before walking away.<br />
“So much for sleeping in on a Saturday,” Penny looking at her mate as he dries he feathers off.<br />
<br />
“He must be in a mood again,” Rudolph getting up; “I swear he has to get over the death of his mother. It’s rotting him from the inside out.”<br />
“Me and Elly weren’t exactly in a fit state after watching our father die,” Penny getting up and stretching; her tail feather twitching as a result. We watched as his gun blew up in his face trying to shoot the raccoon deputy,” Penny opening the window blinds, letting the light in. “You don’t get over that in a day or two or with a few rounds of mind bending rounds of wild animalistic fucking.”<br />
“But the latter did help keep you two distracted you until got over it,” Rudolph opening the door; walking to the bathroom with penny following behind.<br />
“Who says me and Elly are over the loss of dad,” Penny speaking as she waited for her mate to finish using the toilet; “we’ll always miss him, even if he was an unhinged doomsday prepper.”<br />
Rudolph didn’t answer as he stepped away and allowed Penny to sit down and empty her bladder. Shaking his head as he had no way to get his best friend out of his miserable funk.<br />
“Let’s just have breakfast first,” Penny getting up and flushing the toilet; “Scabs will eventually come around. You just need to give him time.”<br />
<br />
**********************<br />
<br />
“This is a good spot, to pick a few off,” the armed human putting his rifle down to begin putting on camo paint; ensuring that he is as well-hidden as possible while his partner/spotter does the same. “Make sure to spray yourself with this,” the man tossing the second a bottle with a vile smell liquid in it.<br />
“Gross,” the second man sniffing “what the fuck is it?”<br />
“Deer musk,” the first man answering; “it should mask our scent. Just in case these freaks can sniff us out, i want them to believe if they catch wind of us, we smell like deer.”<br />
“Let’s hop none of them have a taste for venison and start using bows to hunt us,” The second man recoiling as he splashes the concoction onto his neck.<br />
<br />
They were once normal men working regular job until the fury flu pandemic ripped their lives apart. The first man once in the army; leaving the service after two tours and landing a construction job. The second man was once a lumberjack; felling trees for a living, then playing soldier on the weekends; he was once a reservist and a sergeant of the National Guard. Both were experienced in using the M24 sniper rifle. A military grade version of the Remington model 700; both were modified with silencers to keep furies from honing in on the sound gunfire makes, freaking them out and putting them in a rage.<br />
<br />
The two saw the news like every other human survivor about Denise Proudhoof, an anthro tigress fury revealing that she made the fury virus airborne and causing humanity to be replaced with anthropomorphic animals that were clearly bisexual and sexually promiscuous. The revelation that the fury virus mutated the common cold and flu viruses, ensuring that the rest of humanity would soon become furies, pushed the two to act. Determined to try and take out as many furies as they could. It wasn’t had thanks to social media to figure where Denise Proudhoof lived; going so far to make a friend request so they could look at photos on her personal feed. Seeing the name of a hospital and a restaurant, they soon had the town she lived in. Sending this to other humans who might have the same mindset, the two eventually trekked through the Cascadia forest range to the small town near the Washington and Oregon state line.<br />
“Remember to line your shots up carefuly,” The first man peering through his scope; “no wild shooting.”<br />
“I know,” the second man nodding as he crept a few yards away to his chosen spot for a sniper’s nest; “one or two shots then we high tail to some other spot and go again.”<br />
“Exactly,” the first man breathing slowly; remembering his army training; “and if you see a tiger fury, take it out.”<br />
“I understand,” the second man speaking quietly through the coms; he two looks through his scope to scan for a viable target, “Now save the chatter for later,” the man adding as he mulls the option of shooting a rabbit fury getting out of the car, the elk fury collecting shopping carts or the horse fury walking into the supermarket. “So many choices,” the second man thinking to himself.</p>
