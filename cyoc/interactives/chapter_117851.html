<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After laying with each other for awhile, enjoying each others company. Jen and Kylie got up to get dressed and get back to the school. Jen suddenly noticed a problem with her outfit. &quot;Hay Kylie you wouldn&#39;t happen to have a pocket knife would you&quot; she asked. &quot;I might have one in the car why&quot; Kylie replied. &quot;I need to cut a hole for my tail.&quot; &quot;Ok but why don&#39;t you just go naked.&quot; &quot;Because it might feel a little weird and just because I can go naked doesn&#39;t mean I should.&quot; &quot;That makes sense after all I&#39;m still wearing my clothes&quot; Kylie replied getting dressed herself. <br />
<br />
As they walked through the woods Jen noticed Kylie starring at her. &quot;What is it Kylie&quot; she asked. &quot;Is it me or is your hair lighter&quot; Kylie said. Jen feeling a little curious grabbed some of her long blonde hair and brought it up to were she could see it. &quot;Maybe it just looks lighter because of my darker skin&quot; Jen said. &quot;Maybe your right&quot; Kylie said as they finally reached the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;how long were we gone&quot; Kylie asked seeing that it was full of cars. &quot;Yeah we&#39;re probably a little late&quot; Jen stated. &quot;Well there goes my perfect attendance&quot; she said walking over to her car. Kylie searched around for a few seconds before pulling out a small pocket knife and handling it over to Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; She said before poking a hole in her pants large enough for her tail. She then gave Kylie back the knife before attempting to put on her pants. It took a couple tries before she finally found a good technique and got her tail through the hole. Jen looked herself over &quot;I like this&quot; she said satisfied by how she looked. &quot;you look beautiful Jen&quot; Kylie said &quot;but maybe we should get to class.&quot; &quot;Ok, see you after school&quot; Jen replied giving her a kiss before heading to class. <br />
<br />
Running through the hallways with her heavy bag Jen finally reached the classroom. &quot;Jennifer Smith your late for... &quot; the teacher said before seeing Jen&#39;s new look. &quot;Oh your going through the transformation how are you feeling&quot; she asked. &quot;Oh um fine I guess&quot; Jen replied feeling a little confused about her teacher&#39;s reaction. <br />
<br />
&quot; Has your mother told you about what&#39;s happening.&quot; &quot;Um no I haven&#39;t even seen her today.&quot; &quot;Oh I&#39;ll inform the faculty about this and we&#39;ll contact your mother as well.&quot; &quot;Ok, so what is happening to me&quot; Jen asked feeling a little scared at this point. &quot;I should probably let your mother explain but don&#39;t worry your going to be okay.&quot; &quot;Now why don&#39;t you take your seat and don&#39;t worry about being late&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, what was that all about&quot; Jen though to herself as she walked up to her desk. &quot;This must be how the curse affected the world in order to make my changes seem normal.&quot; Jen sat down wondering how much her history might have changed. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden one of Jen&#39;s classmates raised his hand and asked &quot;Ms. Kane why does Jen look like that?&quot; &quot;We&#39;ll explain everything at an assembly tomorrow morning&quot; she replied. &quot;until then please don&#39;t bother her about this she&#39;s no doubt having a hard time dealing with these changes as it is&quot; she added. <br />
<br />
For the rest of the day no one really brought it up but they obviously knew what was happening. What was this secret that her mom&#39;s been keeping from her. While se knew that this was because of the curse, it did little to relieve her of the stress she felt. &quot;I wonder what changed&quot; she thought as she walked to her next class. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how Kylie&#39;s day is going&quot; thinking about her made Jen feel a little better. She didn&#39;t know why but the thought of being with Kylie again felt right. &quot;Wait a minute em I starting to have feelings for kylie&quot; Jen though to herself. <br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s thoughts were interrupted wen she heard someone call her name. She turned to find her friend Liz walking towards her. Liz was a tall girl with short blonde hair, green eyes, tan skin, and D cup breasts. &quot;Wow they weren&#39;t joking about you going through some kind of transformation where they&quot; Liz said. &quot;So how do you feel Jen&quot; she asked. &quot;I Ok with the transformation in fact I kinda love the tail but what&#39;s really freaking me out is that my mom has been hiding something from me&quot; Jen replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry, but get this your not the only one who&#39;s going through a transformation at this school&quot; Liz said. &quot;You remember that kid we panted the other day, well it turns out that he was actually a girl&quot; she said. &quot;WHAT&quot; Jen screamed genuinely surprised by this news. &quot;Yeah it turns out that her body wasn&#39;t developing properly so she was given some medicine that was supposed to correct it&quot; she explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I kind of already met her this morning she&#39;s kinda hot now and kinda cool&quot; Jen said. &quot;Cool you should bring her to cheer practice so we can meet her, you&#39;re still going right&quot; Liz asked. &quot;Yeah I got my uniform in the bag&quot; Jen replied. &quot;Oh I can&#39;t wait for are extracurricular activity&quot; Liz said with a wink &quot;Mmm me neither&quot; Jen replied her clit beginning to swell. &quot;Ok see you then, by the way I love your new eyes&quot; she said running off to class. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what about my eyes&quot; Jen exclaimed knowing that she hadn&#39;t done anything to her eyes. Jen ran to the nearest bathroom and looked into the mirror. To her horror Jen&#39;s eyes had changed her eyes were now violet with slit pupils. Not only that but her hair is getting lighter almost white now. &quot;Oh god what&#39;s happening to me&quot; she said &quot;I need to go back to normal before this gets even more out of hand.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait shouldn&#39;t I crave transformation shouldn&#39;t I want this&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong I&#39;m not being affected by the curse like I should be, I have to find Kylie&quot; she said. Knowing that Kylie will meet with her at the gym at the end of the day Jen decided to wait and talk to her then. <br />
<br />
Soon enough school was over and Jen quickly went to the gym to wait for kylie. At this point her hair was now completely white, and her ears have grown longer and pointed. To her relief Kylie arrived before asking &quot;Jen you look a little different have you been using the curse without me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie something&#39;s wrong, my body&#39;s changing on its own&quot; Jen said a worried look on her face. &quot;Oh god what should I do&quot; Kylie said wanting to help. &quot;First I&#39;m going to use the curse on you, I want you to say dare ok?&quot; &quot;Ok&quot; Kylie replied. &quot;good then I want you to curse me and remove every thing that&#39;s been done to me ok&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Jen&quot; Kylie said. &quot;Thank you&quot; Jen replied &quot;now transform or dare?&quot; &quot;Dare&quot; Kylie replied. &quot;For your dare you no longer have to obey my commands, you can use the curse however you wish, and you don&#39;t have to be my lover if you don&#39;t want to&quot; Jen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your freeing me but why&quot; kylie asked. &quot;Because I trust you&quot; Jen replied &quot;my fate is in your hands.&quot; &quot;Thank you Jen&quot; Kylie said before giving her a very passionate kiss. &quot;Ok Jen trans...&quot; Was all kylie was able to say before her voice was mysteriously silenced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie are you okay&quot; Jen asked as she watched her try again and again to say the words but each time her voice is silenced. Tears began to stream down Kylie&#39;s face as she looked up at Jen and said &quot;Jen I&#39;m sorry it looks like you&#39;ve become immune to the curse I can&#39;t change you back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen fell to her knees realizing that any chance of having a normal life is gone. &quot;Kylie I&#39;m scared&quot; she said beginning to cry. Wanting to comfort Jen Kylie kneeled down and embraced her tightly before saying &quot;Jen I&#39;m here for you whatever you need I&#39;ll do it.&quot; Jen quickly returned her huge before saying &quot;thank you Kylie just don&#39;t leave me.&quot;</p>
