<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Duuuude this is not what I had in mind when I messaged you to switched physiques!&quot; said Jim. He was feeling awkward yet excited speaking in his new higher pitched voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I hope not, cause this is not what I signed up for! I wanted to gain some weight and appear a little manlier but I definitely didn&#39;t want to switch bodies completely with you!&quot; replied Bobby in his now lower-pitched timbre. <br />
<br />
“Ouch that hurts. What’s so wrong about my body? Up till yesterday you wanted to have my physique!” Jim felt somewhat offended and irritated by Bobby’s comment and retorted “Don’t you blame this on me! I didn’t plan on things turning this way either Bobby, or should I call you Booby now haha?”<br />
<br />
“Hey that’s not cool man” said Bobby while looking down properly at his new body for the first time since the transformation. Jutting out in front of him were two hairy moobs overflowing from the side of his body. He subconsciously gave them a squeeze with his free hand. At least they weren’t all fat he thought, they were actually quite firm hinting at a decent pair of thick pecs despite being hidden by a good layer of fat. But why did Jim’s nips – now his nips – have to be so damn large? Oh well at least his chest – no wait his entire body – was now covered with a generous layer of brown pelt, that he had so longed to have ever since puberty passed him by without barely changing him.<br />
<br />
Jim was shouting something down the line but Bobby was still entranced in a world of his own examining his new physique. He looked through the crevice between his two firm moobs to see the rest of him, but his view was obscured somewhat by a mould further below in the middle covered with a treasure trail. He gave his new belly a bit of a pat and again felt some firmness to his mass. He had to arch his back forward quite a bit to have a look at his feet, even from his now higher vantage point. He barely toppled over forward; he wasn’t yet used to his new centre of gravity, but a least he got a glimpse at his new feet. They had grown like the rest of him, not only were they several size larger but they were now also stouter and wider. He gave them his hairy toes a wiggle.<br />
<br />
“Are you still there Bobs? Bob? Is the line okay? Hellooo? Earth to Bobbb! –“<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’m still here.” Answered Bobby in a dry low rumble.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry for what I said Bob, but seriously what’s so wrong about having my body, after all you were ogling after my physique till not so long ago?”<br />
<br />
“Well for one thing I’m not too thrilled about my new moobs hahaa! No one in my family has moobs, not even my overweight dad and uncle Chuck; we don’t gain weight in the chest. I had thought if I gained your mass the weight would distribute way better and look good on me” He realised he may have hurt Jim with this and in a conciliatory tone quickly added “But joking aside I didn’t think this would work and I certainly didn’t plan on taking over your life, I was quite happy with mine, if it wasn’t that I still looked so damned skinny!” <br />
<br />
“Since we’re in the mood for confessions, I have to admit I’d prefer if I didn’t get your whiny voice and that’s not to say anything about looking like a God damn’d kid. And I always thought blond hair didn’t look good on a man hahaa. So I guess I’m not too happy about looking completely like you either!” came Jim’s retort.<br />
<br />
“But Bobby look at it like this, at least in a way we got our wish. I finally got rid of all that fat – I can see all the way down to my feet without toppling over for the first time in years!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah and finally I’m carrying some heft and look like a man. My days of always being asked for ID at bars are definitely over”<br />
<br />
“See, even you’re looking at the silver lining. So just chill. We know each other well enough to live each other’s lives at least for now until we fix this –“<br />
<br />
“Fix this? You mean this can be fixed?” said Bobby a little too enthusiastically.<br />
<br />
“Yeah shit-brain, that’s what I’ve been trying to tell you until you spaced out on me on the phone. There were two pages stuck together in the book. I mixed the final part of the spell with that of the next one which was a body swap spell!” <br />
<br />
“F*CK you man! See I always told you you’re a slow-poke! How could you do something like that?”<br />
<br />
“Well careful what you say there bitch. If I were you, hahaa – LOL – I’d have a look at myself again before calling anyone slow. You’re the big guy now not me”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… true”<br />
<br />
“But seriously if I’m reading this the right way now I think I can whirl another of my *good* tasting drinks from this spell book – the PROPER way now – and hopefully fix things. So get that big ass of yours over so we’ll do things the right way Bob – “<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to tell me twice Jim, or should I call you little Jamie now? Hahaa. See ya in a few” said Bobby as he hung the line and realised he was still in his boxers, which were now stretched taut and about to burst at the seams. <br />
<br />
Bobby made his way to his wardrobe to attempt the impossible task of finding something that fits his new physique. He subconsciously enjoyed how the floorboards were creaking under his new weight. As he reached for the wardrobe handle he realised that he was now at least 6 inches taller as he had to reach further down to get to it. <br />
<br />
He opened his wardrobe door and Jim’s old reflection stared back at him in the full-length mirror on the door’s inside. Maybe being Jim isn’t going to be so bad if we don’t manage to fix this, Bobby admitted to himself while absentmindedly scratching the itch in his new brown stubble. While he still wasn’t too keen on the moobs, he had to admit looking like Jim had its perks. For one thing he was taller and he had a manly pelt and stubble whereas previously he was only 5’6” and couldn’t grow a beard to save his life. Jim’s face wasn’t too bad either. He had always envied Jim’s square jaw despite it fusing with his neck because of his mass. And the combination of his manly brow and large, inviting brown eyes gave Jim a masculine yet approachable look. And then there was the physique Bobby had always longed to build for himself without success. Jim had a decent V-shape to him that Bobby had always admired, despite it being buried under a generous amount of padding. He wasn’t too keen on the moobs, the gut, the bit of love handles; he had hoped that if Jim’s hair-brain spell worked the extra girth would look better on him than it did on Jim, padding his arms and legs rather than settling in his mid-section. But anyhow, he could probably learn to accept this, and with a bit of weight loss Jim’s body could look studly.<br />
<br />
He rummaged in his wardrobe for the biggest clothes he could find. Thank goodness he hadn’t thrown out his dad’s old hand-me-downs. He managed to fit his new mass in a gray T shirt and black shorts that looked small on him, even though they had always seemed tent-like to him before.<br />
<br />
He left his room, trying to run as quickly as possible to get to Jim’s place. Jim’s body – well now his body – was definitely bulky and slow he thought as he felt his thighs rubbing together. He put on the biggest thong flip-flop he could find, which was still too small, got his keys from the side-table and made his way out of his apartment slamming the door behind him.</p>
