<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having a few minutes to burn, I contemplated the things I could now do with this ring once again. I had made a <br />
hot girl reveal to me her sexual interests without thinking twice about it, a feat I doubt I could've pulled <br />
off on my own. I always had a bit of a control fetish, and now I had the means to assert ultimate control...<br />
<br />
I realized I've been spending the last few seconds staring at Kelly, and she realized it too, apparently. <br />
&quot;What?&quot; she said, giggling nervously. I decided to make my move. <br />
<br />
Kelly suddenly grimaced. Her stomach turned and she put her hand to it. She became very acutely aware that she <br />
desperately needed to fart, which surprised her. Usually she had no trouble holding this sort of stuff inside, <br />
and always managed to maintain the image of a controlled, well groomed woman. But this... she felt as though <br />
her asscheeks would soon burst!<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, would you excuse me for a moment?&quot; she told Joe. &quot;I think there was something in that sandwhich that <br />
didn't agree with me&quot;. As soon as  Joe nodded she took off. She didn't even notice the smirk on his face, as <br />
she was far more worried of anyone catching her like this. The pressure in her anus continued to build and <br />
even though she quickly located the lady's room, by the time she reached it the sound of compressed gas being <br />
released escaped her cute bubble butt. She realized it was taking all of her willpower to maintain even this <br />
much control, and in a fit of panic burst into an empty stall, ignoring the puzzled glances of women around <br />
her, and quickly undid her stylish belt and sat on the cold toilet. As soon as she let go even slightly, a <br />
veritable roar escaped from her ass as she shat harder than she could remember ever doing. She bent over, <br />
groaning and hugging her slim frame, as rock-solid excrement tore through her, and tears flowed from her eyes <br />
as a result of effort more than anything else.<br />
<br />
Joe smiled to himself as he waited outside of the lady's room. Even this far, he could hear Kelly defecating. <br />
The ring had worked well. &quot;I wish she wouldn't think I had anything to do with this before I tell her <br />
otherwise, and I wish she'd be ashamed of how she's conducting herself on this date of ours&quot;, he mumbled. <br />
Thinking further, his eyes widened with inspiration and anticipation, and he made yet another wish.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kelly could feel her stomach letting up. Wiping herself, she leaned back and sighed with relief, <br />
before suddenly becoming overcome with embarrassment. She covered her eyes with her hand. Her date with Joe <br />
was going so well, when suddenly this! She would have to make it up to him somehow. As she flushed the water <br />
she pondered at exactly when did she start to think of this as a date, when suddenly she noticed something <br />
strange going on. As if to match the sound of the swirling water, her breasts very clearly started to jiggle. <br />
At first she was puzzled that they'd do this, since she was certain she was sitting still for the past few <br />
moments, but her train of thought was derailed when they very clearly began to swell.  Her nipples were <br />
clearly poking through her shirt, and as her C cups pushed forwards, her modest cleavage was very quickly <br />
becoming very immodest indeed. At this point she was properly freaked out, and her heart pounded frantically <br />
in her still-expanding chest. Just as her breasts, now DD if not E, spilled over both her bra and shirt, <br />
revealing her enlarged nipples to the air, the growth seemed to slow, then stop. Kelly stared at them for <br />
several moments. She quickly thought of what she'd do next. She'd have to go home right away, go see some <br />
doctor, this was crazy, she'll have to check back with June another time. She hoped Joe would still be <br />
interested in her, though she wouldn't blame him for running off, both because of her behavior and because of <br />
her ridiculous new figure. She sighed sadly, as she knew this was a foolish hope. She was only a somewhat <br />
pretty girl who can't even control her bowels, whereas he was a smart, charming, handsome young man with a <br />
magical ring. He could have any girl he wanted... she only hoped he'd be generous enough to help her become <br />
her old self again.<br />
<br />
She got up from the toilet seat...or tried to get up. She tugged again, confused. Her ass remained firmly <br />
entrenched in the toilet. She tried grabbing the door knob and pulling herself up, but to no avail. Now this <br />
was bizarre. Did the toilet somehow get smaller? She looked down... and gasped as her still tiny waist <br />
ballooned downwards to a huge, round ass.<br />
<br />
She screamed.</p>
