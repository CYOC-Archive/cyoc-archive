<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim saw only the same jeans and t-shirt over his young college-aged body that he&#39;d seen since waking up. A crash and a bang however was heard from outside his room, which now seemed changed as a full-sized bed had appeared where before only a lonely twin bed  had existed a moment ago. Tim heard another bang from outside his door, and without thinking he immediately took flight feeling that he had to check on the boys, lest they destroy the house. Tim opened his door to find the house transformed from that of a suite full of college guys, to what looked like an apartment littered with toys, clothes and other items intended for toddler boys. There was banging in the kitchen and Tim hurried in to find Dace and Blaise were now what looked to be two years old and happily banging on pots and pans they&#39;d pulled out of one of the lower level cabinets that they&#39;d been kept in. In terms of appearance, they looked just the same as they had at his age, but now a lifetime&#39;s worth younger it seemed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dada!&quot; cried out Blaise who dropped the spatchula in his hand and toddled over to Tim--arms outstretched for a hug. Without much consideration, Tim bend down and scooped Blaise up, causing the boy to giggle before he attempted as good a hug as any two to three year old could with their chubby little arms. <br />
<br />
Dace wasn&#39;t far behind and was now at Tim&#39;s leg and tugged insistently at his pants&#39; leg saying: &quot;Up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clearly however Blaise was treated, Dace was insistent on getting just as much attention--and to think a few minutes ago these to toddlers in training pants were his roommates who were interested in archaeology. Tim, obilged Dace, and without knowing how he did so, scooped the second toddler up without dropping Blaise. It was at once a completely new experience and yet something that he felt he had much practice at.<br />
<br />
Holding Blaise and Dace like this as they clung to him, was causing Tim to suddenly remember that when he&#39;d got to college he&#39;d had got drunk at a party and forgot to use a condom--and apparently Melissa who&#39;d he had slept with, wasn&#39;t on the pill. And so, nine months later, Melissa gave birth to quintuplet boys--each who looked somewhat different from one another, and yet had some feature of Melissa or Tim&#39;s on them. Like Dace, he was now convinced had his nose--Blaise his chin. Which was odd, considering that they only looked younger, not any different. Curious as to what this meant, Tim returned Dace and Blaise back to the living room where a sleeping Stephen and Matt were sprawled out in a fenced off play area, having fallen asleep watching cartoons it seems--which Tim turned off. Stephen had his hair, and Matt his ears Tim thought as he took a second to put his hands upon their slowly rising and falling backs. That only left Oscar--well, Oskie, as he was being called at the moment. Oskie was found in what used to be his old room, which had now apparently absorbed Dace and Blaise&#39;s room as well to turn into a rather spacious nursery with a large pop-up crib that seems to be how his quints preferred to sleep--all together. Oskie was tenatively pounding out notes on a toy piano that looked more like what Tim might have played as a child than anything modern looking--in fact all the toys looked to be from Tim&#39;s childhood if not earlier. Memories of looking for old but usable baby toys at thrift stores popped into Tim&#39;s head, causing him to remember, that though he was living with his boys--he was only just making by as a student with a part-time job that along with looking after the quints was causing to burn his candle on three ends--but he&#39;d gotten this far in his degree, he wasn&#39;t going to quit it now--and the boys didn&#39;t need as much attention as they had at the start--especially since Melissa&#39;s mother was helping since Melissa had died. Died? Yeah, his memories were telling him that Melissa had died giving birth to the quints due to an unforeseen complication with the pregnancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;This life is starting to feel a bit tragic,&quot; muttered Tim as he scooped Oskie up--he looked tired. Tim didn&#39;t know how he knew that--but he knew just from looking at Oskie that he was in fact tired and needed his afternoon nap. Something which Tim&#39;s studying would thank his luck for later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for nap,&quot; coaxed Tim as Oskie attempted to squirm in his grasp. Tim now thought how Oskie had his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sweepy!&quot; contradicted Oskie, but the way he&#39;d stuck his thumb in his mouth and rested his head against Tim&#39;s body said otherwise.<br />
<br />
Tim gently laid Oskie down with his other four newly minted brothers, and Tim knew he had a little bit until they&#39;d wake up, to study. But first, a quick look in a certain mirror was required, and so Tim went into the bathroom and turned on the light and looked in the mirror. The young father staring back at him looked somewhat like him, and yet completely different. Body parts of his roommates that he&#39;d always been a tad jealous over--Dace&#39;s smaller nose, Blaise&#39;s strong jawline, Stephen&#39;s thick wavy jet black hair, Matt&#39;s ears that weren&#39;t too small for his head, and Oscar&#39;s hazel colored eyes. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s how he&#39;d become the father of all five of them, he&#39;d taken on traits of them that he&#39;d always wanted, and he didn&#39;t look half bad either. Curious as to how else he&#39;d been changed, Tim shucked his clothes until he was naked and looked fully upon his body. The metamorphosis seemed to have transferred other parts to him--Stephen&#39;s long and toned legs, Blaise&#39;s size 14 feet, Dace&#39;s abs, Matt&#39;s pects and biceps, and the one time he&#39;d seen it when he&#39;d accidentally walked in on Oscar before he&#39;d finished wrapping a towel around himself--Oscar&#39;s rather large schlong.<br />
<br />
There were still elements of him there--the overall shape of his head, his large paw like hands, and his long torso, still were his, along with other things--like that mole on the side of his neck that&#39;d been there since as long as he could remember, and the scar he had on his left leg from that time he&#39;d busted it trying to skateboard. He was still himself, just slightly altered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I could get used to this...&quot; said Tim with a grin, admiring himself one last time before he put his clothes back on and going to study. He took a brief moment to look in on his boys--his boys... that felt so natural to think, now--only to see the five of them had somehow in their sleep congregated together in something almost resembling a dog pile. They all seemed comfortable and at ease all tangled in each other&#39;s arms and legs--as though they wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br />
<br />
While he could waste away more precious nap time admiring his boys, Tim knew he had to get back to studying, and with it finally quiet enough to study.</p>
