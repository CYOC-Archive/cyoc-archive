<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the plans finalized for the girls&#39; trip to Japan, Morgana was working on taking stock on inventory. She was going to be needing more werefox inhibitor potions in the future for Renata and Kristi. Morgana was relieved those two wanted to keep their new vupline instincts under control. Werefoxes are not inherently evil, but they tend to have an amorality that could hurt others with their impulsive decisions.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how long until I learn to make potions like that?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be patient. Brewing potions isn&#39;t like cooking or chemistry,&quot; said Morgana. She paused and said, &quot;Ok, it&#39;s a lot like that, but there&#39;s still more to it. For starters, not everyone can mix together such poisonous ingredients and come up with something that isn&#39;t toxic to either the brewer or the potential customer. You&#39;ll be starting on simpler potions that won&#39;t have dangerous consequences if they go wrong. Werefox inhibitor potions are a bit above your current level right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;ve been hearing how werefoxes are considered a nuisance, but are they really that bad?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like every sentient race, there are good ones and bad ones. Believe it or not, I&#39;ve met some rather decent demons and once had an encounter with an angel who <i>thought</i> he was good but was doing horrible things to those he deemed &#39;evil&#39;. I was lucky to escape with my life that time,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;But as for werefoxes, some are better than others, who at least attempt to keep a handle on their thieving, tricking, and philandering ways. But as for the worst... Well, you know all those unflattering stories they tell about gypsies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying that werefoxes...&quot; started Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the ones who gave the rest of the Roma a bad name, yes,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;The Roma have a rather deep grudge against werefoxes and have grown rather adept at hunting them. Come to think of it, there are many Roma spells that are very effective against various magical creatures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re monster hunters?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily, but when you&#39;re considered persona non grata by other humans, you seem to be easy prey for non-humans. They had to craft those spells to protect themselves,&quot; said Morgana.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this inhibitor potion is one of them?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, it was originally meant to be a poison for them,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;A foxbane potion if you will. But over time, it&#39;s been refined so that it would simply werefox impulses more controllable instead of killing them outright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, they heard a knock on the window. They looked to see a white owl with a satchel tied around its right leg. &quot;Ah, Hermes is finally back,&quot; said Morgana, going to open the window. Hermes hopped through and held out his leg, expecting to be untied. Once the satchel was off, he flew to a perch in the back and tucked into himself for a nap.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think delivery owls were an actual thing,&quot; said Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe me, the postage system is preferable, but some people simply live where the mailmen can&#39;t reach them,&quot; said Morgana before opening the satchel. Inside, she found a manila envelope that felt like it was containing several papers, a small bottle, and a letter addressed to her. Morgana opened the letter and read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgana,<br />
<br />
&#39;My apologies for the long delay in responding, but it&#39;s quite a long flight between Washington and Oklahoma. Hermes needed to recuperate before I can send him back. Which was just as well because we needed time to make some preparations.<br />
<br />
&#39;First of all, we are thrilled that a new werehyena pack is forming in Stokerville, even if the members of this pack are unorthodox. Selena will have a lot to learn as an alpha. I&#39;ve included a letter to tell her about werehyenas, how to run a pack, and blueprints for setting up their homestead when they&#39;re ready to establish their own territory. They are all included in the envelope.<br />
<br />
&#39;Your young shaman, Taylor, is going to need help to learn how to be a shaman. As skilled a witch as you are, this is beyond your ability to teach. As such, my shaman, Kweli, prepared this potion for her. Have Taylor drink this and her soul will be bound to Kweli&#39;s for a lunar month. Kweli will be able to communicate with Taylor in her dreams and teach her the basics of being a shaman until she&#39;s strong enough to be able to communicate with the spirits herself.<br />
<br />
&#39;However, there is another matter that you should be aware of. I am sending my own daughter, Kibibi, and hir mate to Stokerville. They&#39;ll be driving a truck so it will take them longer to reach you than your owl. Kibibi is to help teach Selena how to structure her pack and provide muscle if battle is necessary. Please note that Kibibi will eventually become an alpha hirself one day and has the attitude to match. I specifically forbade her from challenging Selena for leadership of the pack, but you may wish to keep an eye on her anyways. Kibibi is also being sent there in unofficial exile. Just before she was sent, there was an...altercation where she castrated another werehyena during a sparring match. I am hoping that you might have something that will restore Enzi&#39;s testicles. I know Hermes needs to rest before he can be sent back. I&#39;m hoping that when Kibibi reached Stokerville, communication will become easier.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m sure Selena already knows this, but she should not try to draw attention to herself before her pack is fully formed. We werebeasts are very territorial and I&#39;m sure the werewolves will not like sharing Stokerville with them. That&#39;s one of the main reasons I&#39;m sending Kibibi. I&#39;m hoping the magic items she has will allow her to build her pack until they are equal in size and strength to the werewolves. As soon as she has established herself, I&#39;d gladly like to meet her, from one alpha to another.<br />
<br />
&#39;Please allow Hermes to rest before sending him back. We shall try to establish a better method of communication later,<br />
<br />
&#39;Alpha Zuri Mwanga of the Fort Hyde Werehyena Pack&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;PS: Shaman Kweli&#39;s spirits say that there&#39;s a skulk of werefoxes currently in your area. You know how troublesome they can be. If they haven&#39;t already made themselves known with their mischief, I felt like I should inform you. I suggest you drive them off before they cause trouble.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;PSS: Speaking of werefoxes, one of our cubs, Asha, has disappeared. She is the result of a one-night stand between a werefox and one of my pack, Amani. I&#39;m afraid Asha has inherited much of her father&#39;s nature. I would not be surprised if she had stowed away with Kibibi. Please confirm if Asha is with them when they arrive. Her mother is quite worried.&#39;<br />
<br />
Morgana read the lengthy letter with interest. If this was just a letter written for her, how long as Selena&#39;s letter. &quot;Dani, I have an errand for you to run,&quot; said Morgana. She handed Dani the envelope and the bottle. &quot;Take these to Selena&#39;s pack, they&#39;ll be having a sleepover at Karnstein Manor tonight. The envelope is for Selena, the bottle is for Taylor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is Taylor finally going to become a shaman?&quot; asked Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;And don&#39;t feel like you have to rush back. You can spend the night with the vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not something that a normal person would encourage,&quot; observed Dani.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not normal people,&quot; said Morgana, &quot;Particularly you now.&quot; She flicked at Dani&#39;s feline ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you all about it tomorrow,&quot; promised Dani before hurrying out.<br />
<br />
Morgana glanced again at her letter. She&#39;ll need to remember to ask Ky&#363;ri to send a tanuki among the exchange students. A sample of tanuki sperm should restore Enzi&#39;s testicles.</p>
