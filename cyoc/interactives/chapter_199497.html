<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michelle stood shocked at her transformation. The moonlight fell on her in a cold light, and she could see her new body clearly. Her legs were now long and strong, but more importantly, feline. They were covered in pitch black fur and ended in huge feline paws complete with sharp retractable claws. Strikingly, her breasts had multiplied to eight total, with her original breasts being the largest and the other six forming twin rows that ran down her torso. Her eyes had a feline look to them, and her new muzzle was big and powerful looking. The changes in her face were staggering, but the changes to her body were just as shocking. She had become the perfect mix of human and panther, and it was absolutely amazing.<br />
<br />
Michelle, as a new were-panther, felt the desire to run and hunt. These urges were new and strange, but she couldn&#39;t stop thinking about them. She had to follow them, had to hunt, had to run, and there was nothing that could stop her. She took off into the woods, feeling her powerful paws and the new fur of her body. Her tail was long and powerful, and kept her balance as she ran on all fours. Her powerful new sense of smell was astounding, and the world was filled with new smells she had never encountered before. She couldn&#39;t help but chase the new scents. Her ears flicked back and forth as she ran, her nose following the trail. Michelle stopped and sniffed, her tail flicking from side to side. She could smell the fresh scent of prey, but couldn&#39;t pinpoint it. The smell was coming from somewhere close, but she couldn&#39;t place it. Her nose twitched and her tail wagged, a low growl resonated from her throat. Michelle was hungry. She started running again, her legs pumping and her paws moving her forward. Her powerful new body had the stamina of a wild beast, and she could run all night if she wanted to. The fresh scent was getting stronger, and Michelle could now tell it was the scent of a deer. She slowed down, and followed the scent as it led her to a small clearing. The scent was coming from the middle of the clearing, and Michelle knew that the deer was there. She took a deep breath, her nostrils flaring. Her mouth opened, as she prepared to pounce. Michelle could feel her new body ready to spring, her muscles flexing as she readied herself for the kill.<br />
<br />
Her tail flicked from side to side, and she leapt into the air. She landed on the deer&#39;s back, her powerful claws digging into its hide. The deer&#39;s eyes went wide, and it let out a terrified squeal. It tried to kick, but it was too late. Michelle had sunk her teeth into the deer&#39;s neck and bit down, her powerful jaws tearing into the soft flesh and breaking it&#39;s vertebrae. The deer fell to the ground, its legs twitching. It&#39;s lifeblood was pouring from the wound. Michelle tore into the carcass with her vicious panther-like teeth, ripping flesh and eating as fast as she could. She felt her strength growing with each bite, and soon she was full. She looked down at her prey, as her instincts finally faded to the background. Michelle finally started to think normally again and remembered that this morning, she had been human.<br />
<br />
&#39;What happened to me?&#39; Michelle thought to herself. She looked down at her hands, and realized that they now had paw pads and were covered in fur; her nails were now sharp retractable claws. Her skin was covered in fur, and her breasts had grown considerably. She ran her hands down her body, and could feel the extra breasts and nipples that had grown on abdomen. They were soft but perky and all covered in fur. &#39;What did I do?&#39; She thought to herself. &#39;What is happening to me?&#39; Michelle looked down at her body, and her new furry tail twitched behind her. &#39;I-I&#39;m some kind of monster.&#39; She thought to herself. Michelle got up, trying to think of what to do. She knew she had to get back to her camp site, but after that she had no idea. Michelle was scared and didn&#39;t know what to do. &#39;Maybe I can just stay here. It&#39;s not like anyone will find me. I&#39;m in the middle of the woods. No one is going to come looking for me.&#39; Michelle thought to herself. &#39;I&#39;ll just stay here until I come up with a better plan.&#39;<br />
<br />
Michelle walked into the clearing and picked up the deer. She was surprised at how heavy the deer was, but her new muscles were more than able to handle the load. She grabbed the deer by the hind legs and carried it back to her campsite. When Michelle arrived, she placed the deer against a nearby tree. She was tired, but she knew that she would be able to rest soon. She climbed into her tent and lay down. Michelle mewled softly and cover her eyes with her paw-like hands, while small tears formed in the corners of her eyes. &#39;I just need to sleep for a little while. That&#39;s all I need to do. Then I&#39;ll be able to think of a plan.&#39; Michelle closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p>
