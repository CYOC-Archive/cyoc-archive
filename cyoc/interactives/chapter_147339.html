<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...and with that, I&#39;ll conclude today&#39;s lecture,&quot; Eric droned into the microphone at the front of the lecture hall. &quot;Remember to do the readings for next week, we&#39;ll be going over the androgen signalling pathway.&quot; The skinny lecturer kinked his back as he took a long glug from his water bottle. He sighed heavily as he watched his class filter out and the lights of the lecture hall began to brighten. And that&#39;s when he saw him.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s eyes went wide as the memories came flooding back, ones he had long suppressed, yet often dreamed of. Standing at the back of the lecture hall was an imposing figure, the man had to be at least 6&#39;6&quot;, and so thickly built he would put even seasoned bodybuilders to shame. He had to be at least 400 pounds, his arms so engorged with muscle that they splayed out to the side, losing the fight for space from his gargantuan lats and pecs. As the lights grew to full brightness, Eric adjusted his glasses, seeing the splitting image of someone who had become a ghost to him -- Steve. But that was impossible, the man standing there at the back was far too young, both in looks and attire -- his skin radiant in the sodium light, his hair pulled back into that insipid man-bun that kids were wearing these days. He wore a black t-shirt and jeans, both painted on, a pathetically small backpack slung over one of his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Sorensen?&quot; the man boomed, his voice deep and commanding. He began making his way forward and Eric&#39;s eyes went wide, taking in the sheer magnitude of the man in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Steve?!&quot; Eric yelped, taking a step back. Memories came flooding back of the Male Magnification Machine and the encounter Eric had with the most muscular man on the planet 20 years ago. The brute of a college wrestler had grown immense, growing to 80 times his own weight, which for an average male meant that Steve had grown to 6 tons, 12 000 pounds of sheer, brutal alpha male. After Steve had grown to such huge sized and destroyed half his lab, Eric had given up on using his machine; Steve jumping through his roof had destroyed the infrastructure needed to run the machine and the scrawny scientist had run out of money. Dejected, he took up a teaching position as a sessional lecturer at the local state college. It paid well, but it was a far cry from the life of muscle worship and sex he had envisioned for himself all those years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be my dad,&quot; the man replied to him. Standing in front of Eric, the puny man could blotted out most of the light and a sly grin crossed his face. Eric couldn&#39;t help but blush slightly, the man was incredibly handsome, the way his face was so overly masculine, boxy and angular, dusted in facial scruff. &quot;Name&#39;s Adam,&quot; he added, holding his hand out. Eric took it and introduced himself.<br />
<br />
They made their way to Eric&#39;s office, the giant having to turn to his side, his heavy pectorals and back scraping along the sides of Eric&#39;s office door. The scrawny professor closed the door and locked it. Adam just smirked when he saw the tiny man do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not here for pleasure, tiny, just business,&quot; the huge man chuckled, tensing his body, causing the fabric of his shirt and shorts to groan, protesting his treatment of them. &quot;That&#39;ll come after,&quot; he added with a wink. Eric almost lost it, his knees buckling as he leaned back against his door to stabilize himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I help you?&quot; Eric gulped, an inkling in his head of what Adam wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Twenty years ago, you changed my dad in some sort of machine, right?&quot; Adam rumbled, stepping forward and peering down over his imposing pectorals, cornering Eric against the door. The smaller man just nodded. &quot;I need to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, you&#39;re huge already!&quot; Eric whimpered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not where I&#39;m from,&quot; Adam growled, his face transforming into a grimace. The huge man recounted a tale that caused Eric to rock hard, painting a scene in his head that came straight out of his greatest dreams that he once had for himself.<br />
<br />
After his magnification, Steve hurtled himself into the wilderness and started a &#39;commune.&#39; A cult is what it sounded like to Eric. Men and women alike would come to the woods to bask in Steve&#39;s glory... and copious amounts of fluid. The offspring of such orgies were many times larger than the average newborn, so much so that it was most certainly lethal to the mothers and for some strange reason, they were all male. Adam was one such child, now fully grown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are they all like you?&quot; Eric whimpered, trying to imagine a group of massively muscular guys being worshiped in the woods as part of some sort of cult.<br />
<br />
&quot;You kidding? They&#39;re all bigger than me,&quot; Adam huffed in annoyance, crossing his titanic arms. &quot;You don&#39;t even know how embarrassing it is, being 19 and then forced to worship your younger brother&#39;s pec cleavage because he&#39;s so much stronger than you.&quot; Eric went rock hard and Adam got a naughty idea. He pulled Eric in, the smaller man&#39;s nose nestling deep into the big man&#39;s pectorals. The two of them groaned for different, yet the same reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grrr,&quot; the beast of a teen roared as he flexed his whole body. His t-shirt began to split along the back and sleeves and Eric creamed himself as he watched Adam flex over and over again. Veins hissed along the surface of Adam&#39;s giant biceps, feeding more blood and size into them...<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you... growing?&quot; Eric yelped, his painfully spent cock springing to attention once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m always growing, tiny,&quot; Adam replied. He flexed even harder and the shirt peeled uselessly off his titanic frame, his smooth, sweat-laced skin laid bare for Eric to ogle and worship. &quot;But,&quot; he grunted, pulling back, finally letting Eric breathe. &quot;I&#39;m not growing fast enough. I need more size... I need to be the biggest,&quot; he said hungrily. &quot;And you&#39;re gonna make it happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric whimpered helplessly, as much as he wanted to worship this beast, the machine was broken, gathering dust in storage...</p>
