<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><I>There&#39;s something in the way you roll your eyes<br />
Takes me back to a better time<br />
When I saw everything is good<br />
But now you&#39;re the only thing that&#39;s good</I><br />
<br />
Curtis was DRUNK as he and Ollie stumbled back towards their dorms. He’d leaned far too heavily into the party in favor of escapism and would very likely regret it in the morning. For now though? His focus was entirely on his sheep as they laughed and kept bumping into each other. The alcohol was a comfortable protection from reality and he just wanted to bury his muzzle in Ollie’s soft fur and disappear with him forever.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d seen Milo and Dare briefly at the party, though they left hours ago. Todd and Sam had even made an appearance as they introduced Curtis and Ollie to Dan, Todd&#39;s cousin. And of course Shro was there. The &#39;nip added a fun layer to the buzz from the alcohol, though he only took a hit or two.<br />
<br />
Ollie, for his part was a great deal more sober, but Curtis barely noticed as his boyfriend helped to guide him home. He seemed amused but pensive and hadn’t left Curtis’ side all night, even as the dog had led the room in a raucous chorus of <i>Raise Your Glass</i>, singing at the top of his lungs at karaoke--something he would have never done before CVU. The sheep couldn’t help but grin and roll his eyes and finally joined in at the dog’s insistence.<br />
<br />
They passed the Great Lawn and Curtis got an idea as he started to pull on Ollie’s hooves. He dragged the sheep towards Bushytail Coffee and stopped.<br />
<br />
“What’s goin on, Pup? They won’t open for another couple hours,” Ollie said, amused.<br />
<br />
“No! Olls, this is where we had our first kiss!” Curtis grinned and tried to gesture wildly but ended up losing his balance and falling into Ollie’s arms. He wagged his tail and licked at his nose. “Remember when you—“ He interrupted himself with a large belch that had the sheep laughing and waving his hoof in front of his muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Yer drunk, dog. Let’s get you to bed, OK? Big day tomorrow.” He petted Curtis’ head and tried to direct him back towards the dorm, but the dog stayed put.<br />
<br />
<I>Tryna stand up on my own two feet<br />
This conversation ain&#39;t comin&#39; easily</I><br />
<br />
“No! Ollie…” Curtis blinked and tried to refocus. “Thank you. For being great. You’re a good sheep. MY sheep!” He pulled Ollie into a deep, wet, stupid kiss.<br />
<br />
Ollie smiled and held onto the dog. “Yer welcome, Curtis. But it’s been my pleasure. Let’s get you back to—whoa! Puppy we&#39;re still in the Quad!” Curtis had begun to grope at the sheep’s dick, drunk and insistent.<br />
<br />
“I wanna fuck you, Ollie. I wanna make you feel good, like you make me feel good. Please?” He continued to paw at Ollie’s pants as the sheep tried to block the advances in such a public setting before finally relenting.<br />
<br />
“How about we get back to my room first, OK? But yer drinkin some water first and brushin yer teeth.&quot; He laughed and started to herd the Australian Shepherd in the direction of the dorms. Curtis fell into step and couldn’t stop wagging his tail with excitement despite the late hour.<br />
<br />
<I>Walk me home in the dead of night<br />
I can&#39;t be alone with all that&#39;s on my mind (Mhm)</I><br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Ollie finally re-entered the room in his towel and Curtis jumped up to meet him. He’d sobered up slightly while the sheep showered, but he felt even more aroused at the sight of his boyfriend in just a towel. He pulled off the towel and took hold of Ollie by the cock and one of his horns and began to kiss him as they moved towards the bed. His dick throbbed, rock-hard, and he felt dizzy with drink and need.<br />
<br />
They laid side by side on the mattress as they made out and jerked each other off. Curtis was too focused on Ollie to notice as his dick began to shift and redden, its tip coming to a point. Certain he couldn’t contain himself anymore, he climbed on top of his boyfriend but then stopped with a thought of preference.<br />
<br />
“Bend over the bed. I want to do this correctly.” He smirked as Ollie complied before pulling the small bottle of lube towards him. “I’ve never topped before so let me know if I do anything wrong, OK?” Ollie nodded and Curtis prepared and looked down at his changed shaft with a smile. It felt right as he saw his sheath begin to form above his white furry balls.<br />
<br />
After slipping a finger or two inside of Ollie to make sure his entrance was properly slick, he took a deep breath and stepped forward to press his red, pointed dick against his sheep&#39;s entrance. “Ready for me, Olls?”<br />
<br />
Ollie nodded again and grabbed onto the bedspread as his tail flicked behind him. Curtis took this opportunity to begin to push forward. He gasped at the sensation and felt his precum further lubricate the area. The sheep was flexible but tight as they began to thrust against each other. Curtis growled subconsciously as he humped and he leaned forward to nip at Ollie’s neck fur and tufty ears. He wanted this to last forever.<br />
<br />
They moaned together, the mixture of soft barks and bleats filling the room as Curtis ran his claws through the fur on Ollie’s back. They were getting there as their breathing and heart rates increased in tandem, and suddenly the sheep tensed as the dog felt a jolt of pleasure at the base of his shaft. He continued to hump and noticed that his thrusts were being stopped short, each one resulting in a wonderful building pressure. Instinct told him to keep going, that he wasn&#39;t done--that if he kept pushing he&#39;d be able to keep his mate there with him, unable to leave.<br />
<br />
<i>So say you&#39;ll stay with me tonight</i><br />
<br />
&quot;God. God. God. That feels amazin, Pup. Yer so thick, God!&quot; Ollie grunted and Curtis watched the ram&#39;s horns further extend into a magnificent set befitting his species. He took hold of them with his paws to use as handlebars. &quot;Don&#39;t stop. Fuck, don&#39;t stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis wanted to be a good dog for his sheep as he slammed into his ass. He pumped in and out, his balls bouncing against soft wooly fur and his tongue hanging out of his mouth as he panted. Then suddenly he saw stars as he thrust forward and Ollie let out a loud bleat. He tried to withdraw to thrust again but found himself stuck, unable to pull out. The pleasure was blinding and he jackhammered in and out. Ollie was groaning as he pumped at his own needy cock and he came with a bleating cry, which caused him to tense up and squeeze on the dog&#39;s new knot, which sent Curtis over the edge with a yowl. He continued to pump as he unloaded into his boyfriend as his entire body tingled with pleasure. The orgasm seemed to last forever and not nearly long enough before he collapsed onto Ollie&#39;s back, panting and head still reeling from the drink.<br />
<br />
Ollie chuckled from under him, &quot;Well, I think yer dick finally changed, Pup. That was amazin. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re goin anywhere for a bit now, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis knew without thinking that his sheep was right. They were tied and would be so for a while as his dick continued to spasm, and they wouldn&#39;t be able to separate until his knot deflated. He was content to lay there as the drunkenness and afterglow protected him for the moment from the scary decisions he would soon have to make. He was comfortable and happy, and none of his worries could stop him from falling asleep with his Ollie in his arms.<br />
