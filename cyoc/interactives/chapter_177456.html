<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four college students live together in a house where they share tasks and expenses. Lilian, Athena, Summer and Luke decided to take advantage of a day when they had no class to do a full house cleaning.<br />
<br />
While cleaning a room, Summer found a dusty box on top of the wardrobe. Athena and Luke convinced her to open the box and there they found several DVDs, the vast majority being from horror movies. They got interested and decided that they would watch one of those movies that night.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
That night, after they had finished cleaning, showered and had dinner, they picked up the box again and looked at the DVDs to choose which one to watch. They saw that most of the films had already been watched by one of them, so they gave priority to one that none of them had ever watched. They found one of which the cover was so eaten by insects that you couldn’t read the title, all they could see was a pair of red eyes and &quot;through the fifth wall&quot; written on a piece that was still on the bottom, what they believed was the end of a phrase used for marketing. As the only log in which they could play the DVD was on Luke&#39;s XBOX they watched it in his room.<br />
<br />
The film was very boring, because for 20 minutes only the monotonous daily life of a woman, who was clearly the main character, was shown. However, it was from this point on that things started to change.<br />
<br />
The woman was working in her office, where she waited until she was the last person in the company. After confirming that she was alone she stopped work, she lowered her panties under her skirt and started masturbating.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not a horror movie, it is a porn movie. Someone must have changed the boxes.&quot; Summer said<br />
<br />
&quot;Who knows, maybe it is an erotic horror.&quot; Athena said<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to change the movie?&quot; Luke asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave some more, at least until this scene is over.&quot; Lilian, who was bi, said caressing her pussy through her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but after this scene is over we’ll put on another movie.&quot; Summer said<br />
<br />
The movie kept being boring since after another 10 minutes all the woman had done differently was to take off her clothes completely, but she continued to masturbate and had not even come.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is very annoying, I can&#39;t wait any longer. Lilian I will ....&quot; Summer said, but when she saw her friend stroking something big that was inside her pants, stretching it to the limit, she said &quot;When did you put something in your Lilian pants? I didn&#39;t even see it when you did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn&#39;t put anything ...&quot; Lilian was saying when she noticed the huge bulge in her pants. She got up quickly and, with her back to the others, she checked what it was. Then she ran out and tried to run out of the room, but she couldn&#39;t open the door at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter Lilian? There&#39;s something wrong?&quot; Athena asked<br />
<br />
Lilian turned to everyone, pulling her blouse down in order to hide what was there and said &quot;I have a dick now.&quot; everyone looked at her with an incredulous look and she said &quot;I am telling the truth. I don&#39;t know why, but my vagina is gone and there is a dick in its place.&quot;<br />
<br />
They still found it hard to believe, as they already knew that Lilian was a normal girl, especially the girls who showered with her from time to time. What left them most in doubt is that they had seen the bulge in her pants before and, by the shape, it could actually be a dick.<br />
<br />
After a minute Athena remembered a story she had seen on the internet before and said to Luke &quot;Quick Luke, turn this movie off. This must be the cursed film that I saw people commenting on the internet, if we don&#39;t stop now the transformations will not stop with Lilian growing male genitals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke didn&#39;t quite understand the situation and didn&#39;t even believe in this cursed film story, but as he was in control he obeyed and tried to stop the film, but it didn&#39;t work. He kept trying unsuccessfully. &quot;I can&#39;t, the film doesn&#39;t stop. Did the controller stop working?&quot; he said<br />
<br />
Suddenly they heard a laugh coming from the TV and when they looked they saw that the woman in the movie had stopped masturbating and was looking straight at the screen with a big smile on her face. &quot;This is useless, you will never be able to stop my movie.&quot;The woman said, clearly speaking to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you talking to us?&quot; Summer asked, still finding the situation they were in unbelievable.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is obvious that I am talking to you, it seems that there is someone else there.&quot; the woman in the movie said<br />
<br />
&quot;You are responsible for what happened to Lilian, aren&#39;t you? Make her go back to npfffff.... pffffff....&quot; Athena said when her voice disappeared and started making only fart sounds. She realized that her mouth was strange and when she put her hand on it she found an anus in its place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put yourself in your place, girl, no human has the right to give me orders.&quot; the woman in the film said, transforming shortly thereafter. Her eyes went bright red as her skin changed to crimson red, a long tail with an arrowtip grew over her ass, a pair of wings on her back and horns on her head.&quot;This is better, boast my true form.&quot; she said when she finished revealing herself to be a demon.</p>
