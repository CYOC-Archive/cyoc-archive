<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Strobing lights, thick fog clouds, and blaring sound. This is what Bong-cha Joon lived for, the girl whipped her neon red hair wildly, the stage lights catching off her multiple facial piercings, her dark edgy makeup imperfectly perfect. <br />
She ripped on her electric guitar and kicked one of the speakers down, planting her black leather, studded and spiked boot up on it.<br />
<br />
“Are you fucking sheep ready for the slaughter!!!” She shouted in her cutely raspy voice.<br />
<br />
The crowd screamed in response and she turned to her jacked, tattooed drummer, he flashed his sharpened grill and roared.<br />
<br />
“Kick those dibshit’s asses!!” She yelled.<br />
<br />
Her drummer, Luca, slammed down on his drums, in return she amped up her strumming and turned back to the cheering crowd. The Korean girl then strutted over to her bassist; Setepenre, a black girl with blue, pink, and green box braids, and flicked her young at her suggestively.<br />
<br />
The three had been a band in the punk rock scene for a few years now. What else was a group of monsters going to do?<br />
Bong-cha herself was a vampire originally from the Kwan Family: one of the many factions that had emerged after The Long Night. She had left her vampire clan to pursue a life of freedom, she hated the idea of spending the rest of her immortal life wearing stuffy dresses, attending dinner parties and dealing with all the the pointless ceremony. <br />
<br />
Setepenre or “Set” as she liked to be called, was a mummy. Not the kind that were wrapped in cloth but more like an immortal from ancient Egypt, she was one of the daughters of Anubis. She had left the realm of the stars to seek a life of excitement, which brought her together with Bong-cha and Luca.<br />
<br />
Luca had tanned skin and long hair, his body was covered in tattoos that obscured the many scars he had, his eyes were piercing blue. The man was a werewolf formerly of the Redwood Pack, he claimed to had been a beta male but he never told anyone anything else about his past. He acted as the girl’s muscle as well as drummer (even though the girls  could take care of themselves).<br />
<br />
“We are Death-Riot! Now get the fuck out of here!!” Bong-cha shouted and put up both middle fingers.<br />
<br />
They were the last band for the night which was fine because the sun would come up soon and the vampire didn’t want to be caught in the sunlight, that would be “such a drag” as the undead guitarist would say.<br />
Luca drove the group in their charmingly beat up van to the abandoned parking garage where they set up shop, the upper floors were boarded up with sheer metal and tarp to protect their front woman from the sun. Inside was lit up with a variety of Christmas, Halloween, and Chinese new year lights. Various signs, posters and neon signs were hung on the walls, Luca parked the car on the floor below them that they used as a makeshift workshop. The werewolf laid down on the beat up patchwork couch that sat in front of a pile of various televisions they set up to watch, Setepenre went past the beaded entrance to her makeshift room that was made from a storage crate to wind down and spend time with her cats. She had asked Set if she wanted Luca to find an RV or van to make her room from but she insisted on a shipping container, said it reminded her of her home.<br />
Bong-cha went to her room that was made from an old RV that was missing its wheels, eager to get inside and finish her meal. <br />
Said meal was a disheveled and beat up man chained from his hands and feet inside the RV’s bathroom. She didn’t know the man’s name but he was a scumbag that was trying to take advantage of a couple of women leaving a nightclub, so the girl decided that the world would be better off without him. His mouth was covered with a makeshift gag made from leather and the femur of one of her other victims. He tried to tell and fight back but he had lost so much blood the the red haired girl that he only managed a few mumbles and twitches. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry shitface, your pathetic existence will be over soon.” She said as she strolled  into the vehicle, swaying her hips.<br />
<br />
The man tried to move but she was on him in a second, she buried her fangs into his neck and drank all the blood he had left. In less than a minute his life was over and she was satiated. <br />
Bong-cha left her room after changing into a comfortable pair of flannel pants and a tank top, she took off her chafing bra and her decent check strained against the fabric of the top.<br />
“I’m done with him, could you get rid of the body before it stinks the shit out of my room?” She asked Luca. <br />
<br />
He gave out a long sigh and got up and started walking to her room adding,<br />
“Next time you’re doing it yourself, you’re stronger than any man so you could lift him with no problem.”<br />
<br />
“Yea but…I don’t want to”. Bong-cha said not being able to think of an excuse as she sat where Luca was.<br />
<br />
“When I come back I want my spot back!” He said entering the girl’s room.<br />
<br />
While the werewolf was disposing of the body, Setepenre came out wearing a purple and gold robe, her hair was up in a protective wrap and sat next to Bong-cha. She put in a chick flick to watch as she opened a bag of the spiciest chips imaginable. She offered them to her friend but the Korean politely refused as being a vampire meant she couldn’t eat food. Setepenre realized her mistake and shrugged her shoulders and curled up her feet onto the couch. <br />
<br />
“Aww hell no! You can’t just take my spot and put on some girl movie like I wasn’t here!” He exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you just swipe another couch? How about one from one of those fancy stores.” Setepenre said amused.<br />
<br />
Luca had enough and with a roar he left for the makeshift garage on the floor below them.<br />
<br />
“I’m not getting you guys any more snacks so don’t fucking ask.” He yelled as he disappeared into the car park below.<br />
<br />
The two girls looked at each other an broke out in laughter.<br />
<br />
“Awww he’s so cute when he stomps off like that!” The dark skinned woman commented.<br />
<br />
“Don’t tell me you’d hit that?” Bong-cha asked in faux shock.<br />
<br />
“Please, he’s not my type plus I’m over three millennia’s old, your girl ain’t a cougar!” She responded with a laugh.<br />
<br />
The two continued watching their vapid and generic movie as the sun rose. <br />
Later that afternoon Luca returned from the lower level, he tossed a newspaper to the girls who read the article the page was turned to.<br />
<br />
“Another gruesome massacre grips city residents…” the vampire read out loud.<br />
<br />
“So what?” She added.<br />
<br />
“I checked out the crime scene while you two were having a slumber party and it looked bad, plus i definitely caught the scent of a vamp.” The long haired man elaborated.<br />
<br />
“Great but what does that have to do with us? I didn’t do it.” Bong-cha replied.<br />
<br />
“We know but if a vampire is killing out in the open like this then you know those high and mighty lords will start snooping around and who do you think they’re going to blame?”<br />
<br />
“Shit.” She said and tossed her head back onto the back of the couch.<br />
<br />
The Korean vampire  had been hunting in the Tepes Family’s territory without their approval and the last thing Bong-cha wanted was to end up in a dungeon or worse. <br />
<br />
“Fuck it, Wyatt can kiss my ass. We’re getting out of Tepes territory before they find us. She announced.<br />
<br />
“What about the killings?” Setepenre asked as the other girl got up from the couch.<br />
<br />
“What does it matter? If we’re not gone by dusk we’ll be up our asses in Tepes goons.” Bong-cha shot back.<br />
<br />
The three looked at each other before deciding what to do.</p>
