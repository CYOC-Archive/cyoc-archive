Later in the afternoon….<br />
<br />
Tora Tachibana stood at the airport gate, looking for his colleague, Dr. Mera Curry. A marine biologist, whose specialty happened to be aquatic were. <br />
<br />
When Tora called her about the Stovall case, she immediately agreed to fly to Moon Lake to consult. As tragic as the situation was, she found Julie to be a very intrigued character. And things at her office were slow. So she could do with a change of scenery. <br />
<br />
It was easy to spot Mera in the crowd, her hair was an almost inhuman shade of red. A pair of gold sunglasses were nestled in her hair. A fairly odd sight given that it was early December in the Northwest. Even stranger, Mera was wearing Army green shorts, and had a matching green button down that was tied around her waist to show off her midriff. <br />
<br />
“I hope you brought something else to wear.” Tora said after hugging his friend. He took a quick sniff, which confirmed his suspicions that Mera was still normal. <br />
<br />
For however long, since she’d made it clear she would make the change eventually. Once she decided on what kind of were she wanted to be. She’d grown up surrounded by all kinds of were, land or sea fairing. Naturally she had an attraction to those like weremer , but she also enjoyed the semiaquatic were like otters or seals. <br />
<br />
“I dress like this year ‘round. I’ll be fine.” <br />
<br />
“In Hawaii, you would be. But you’ll find Moon Lake isn;t as inviting during the winter season.” Tora pointed out. He took one of her bags, and the two started off toward his car. Mera drew stares as they passed through the airport. Again, mostly because of her odd choice in clothing. But also in part because Mera was, bluntly put, hot. <br />
<br />
“Eh, so I’ll buy a jacket.” Mera said with a shrug. Tora chuckled to himself. Though they hadn’t seen each other in about ten years, she hadn’t changed. <br />
<br />
“But enough about my wardrobe, what’s new with you? Aside from work.” Mera asked. <br />
<br />
“Not much. Toshiro started third grade this fall…”<br />
<br />
“Wow! Last time I saw him he must have been in diapers. God, I’m feeling old.” Mara laughed. Tora had to smile at that. Mera was, by all standards, quite at only thirty two. Tora met her while he taught at Stanford. <br />
<br />
“What have you been up to?” Tora asked. They’d reached his car, and began the process of stowing luggage in the trunk. Mera climbed into the passenger seat before answering. <br />
<br />
“Not much. Research projects, corralling some interns, nothing too interesting.”<br />
<br />
“Are you still seeing that guy? What was his name…?” <br />
<br />
** “Garth. And yes I am.” Mera said, happily thinking of her longtime boyfriend. Also a marine biologist like herself, and also pro-were. But Garth had no burning desire to make the change. If he did, then he did. Unlike Mera, who couldn’t wait for that day to come. <br />
<br />
“Are you two any closer to…”<br />
<br />
“No.” Mera sighed. She and Garth had been dating since they were in college together. Mera hoped that he’d eventually propose. There was no obvious rush, but she was rather impatient. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
Back in Moon Lake… <br />
<br />
While Mera and Tora continued to catch up, their patient received an unexpected visitor. <br />
<br />
“Hey Julie.” Arthur Curtis**, a junior from Moon Lake High School appeared in the doorway with an awkward smile on his face. <br />
<br />
Julie was absolutely stunned to see one of the most popular boys from her school standing there looking so nervous. He wasn’t just cute, he was also the only male weremer in Moon Lake. Which made him quite the bachelor among the many, many, MANY mermaids. <br />
<br />
“Hi Arthur. What are you doing here?” Julie asked, trying to make herself more presentable. Her face very flushed, as she couldn’t believe this was happening. For him to see her like this… She didn’t even think he knew she existed. <br />
<br />
“Came for a visit. But if you’d rather I go…”<br />
<br />
“What, no. I mean, uh, I wouldn’t mind some company.” Julie’s cheeks burned red as Arthur slipped inside. <br />
<br />
“How did you know where I was?” Julie asked. <br />
<br />
“Megan Brown told me.” Arthur admitted. He didn’t enjoy telling people he and Megan were friends, and sometimes friends with benefits. She was a notorious gossip, and had a reputation for sleeping around. Not just with guys, but with a few girls too. <br />
<br />
“Oh. Wait, how did she know?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, she was there when you and Eric had your fight.” Arthur was completely unaware of Julie’s “brain problems”. <br />
<br />
“We had a fight?” Julie repeated confused. That would explain why Eric looked so weird yesterday evening. <br />
<br />
“Ya. You don’t remember?” <br />
<br />
“Not really. Everything’s kinda a blur.” Julie explained. Arthur nodded, realizing it would probably be best if he didn’t mention anything else. Like how Eric and Cassie O’Sullivan had become an item. Every werewolf within a ten mile radius heard the two last night. <br />
<br />
“Why exactly are you here?” Julie asked. Not that she really minded Arthur’s company. He was certainly nice to look at. Very nice. His hair was more brown than hers, but still too blonde to be called anything else. And like all mer, his eyes were a vibrant blue. <br />
<br />
“Just making sure you’re okay. Megan made it sound like you were on your deathbed. Don’t know if you’ve check your phone messages, but apparently your friends have been trying to talk to you since yesterday morning.” <br />
<br />
“Oh. Can you tell them I don’t have my phone. I don’t want them to worry. I’m okay now.” Julie said. Arthur nodded. But the awkward feeling in the room started to intensify as the longer the two remained silent. <br />
<br />
Julie couldn’t figure out why Arthur was there. And Arthur was dying to tell Julie that Eric wasn’t interested in her, so he could make his move. He should have years ago, but it wasn’t until Julie started to show serious interest in another guy that he realized how much he liked her. Dare he say love. It wasn’t the “love at first sight” Julie felt towards Eric. At least Arthur didn’t think it was. <br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
**Couldn’t help myself either, sorry. Decided to change things up a little so it’s not verbatim</p>
