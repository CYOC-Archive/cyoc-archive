<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley thinks for a while, “why don’t you go first, Jeff,” she asks, “after all, it is your program. So, I think it’s just logic, that you transform into something or someone first. Have you got any ideas what you’d like to be?”<br />
<br />
“I actually have lots of ideas,” Jeff says, “but I just can’t decide which I would want to try the most.”<br />
<br />
Ashley tilts her head in thought, “well, what are the things you’d like to try?”<br />
<br />
“Um… I’m kind of curious to know what it would be like being an animal… for one,” Jeff says, “but I also would like to become some kind of inanimate object, like, clothing, a toy or even a vehicle. But I also am curious to know what it would be like as the other gender.”<br />
<br />
“I like the idea of you becoming a girl the most,” Ashley says.<br />
<br />
“Why,” Jeff asks.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Ashley says, “having an older brother is cool and all, even though we annoy each other. Having a sister would be amazing! We could play “dress-up” or play with my dolls!”<br />
<br />
Jeff can’t help but chuckles, “that actually does sound like fun,” he says.<br />
<br />
“You know Jeff,” Ashley then says, “I think it would be even more fun if you’d be younger than me! I’d like to know what it’ll feel like being the older sibling! And you could wear some of my old clothes!”<br />
<br />
“How young would I have to be?”<br />
<br />
Ashley shrugs, “I dunno,” she says, “how about six or eight?”<br />
<br />
“Eight sounds good,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“I am surprised that you are so willing to become a little girl,” Ashley says, “I actually thought you’d like not want to be a little girl, that you’d prefer to be a teenage girl.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugs, “I don’t exactly know,” he says, “I just think that, being a little girl would be more fun, I actually do miss being a kid. If I’d become a little girl, not only would I get two ideas dealt with, but you’d also get your wish to be the older sibling, at least for the weekend. Which means: we both win and get what we desire.”<br />
<br />
Ashley smiles, “that sounds great,” the girl’s eyes sparkle, “I already have lots of ideas what we could do together!”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “more than playing dress-up and with dolls?”<br />
<br />
Ashley nods, “of course,” she says, “I could call some friends, we could do a sleepover! We could head to the park and play on the swings and in the sandpit!”<br />
<br />
“Or, we could head to woods,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Ashley looks confused, “the woods are creepy,” she says, “why would you want to go there?”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “I know where there is a beautiful clearing,” he says, “it’s huge! And the whole clearing looks like right out of a fairy tale: a huge field covered in all sorts of beautiful flowers, a stream with clear, clean water and an Appletree in the center!”<br />
<br />
Ashley’s eyes widen, “whoa, that does sound amazing,” she says, “we could make some flower-crowns!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “that we could,” he says, “I think you’ll love it!”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Ashley says, “so, what will you change to become my “little sister”?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll just change my gender to female, and my age from 16 to eight,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Ashley says, “so, you plan to stay a little girl for two full days?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “that is the plan,” he says, “or let’s say: two and a half days, since it is Friday today. We’ll have the rest of today, the whole Saturday and the whole Sunday, I’ll transform back into myself in the evening before our parents return.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds like a plan,” Ashley says, “are you able to set some sort of timer? Or would you have to transform back by changing your file?”<br />
<br />
“I am able to set a timer,” Jeff says, “I think that’ll be the easiest way to transform back, we’d just need to make sure that we are here when the timer runs out.”<br />
<br />
Ashley nods, “yeah,” she says, “I bet it’ll be embarrassing if you’d transform into a boy in public.”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “yeah,” he says, “that’ll be hard to explain, and I’d rather avoid that,” Ashley nods in agreement.<br />
<br />
“So, hurry up and become my little sister,” Ashley says, sounding excited.<br />
<br />
Jeff snorts, then chuckles, “he… someone’s impatient,” he says, grinning.<br />
<br />
Ashley huffs, “I am just excited and can’t wait to be the older sibling for once,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckles, “you’ll get your “little sister” soon enough,” he says, before starting to type.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes Jeff stops typing and looks at the settings he has made, “okay,” he says, “I set my age to eight, my gender to female, I left my sexual orientation normal, since I doubt that I’ll get “hit up” by a boy at that age. I also left the reality alteration off, if we should decide to meet up with some friends of yours, you could simply say that I am a cousin who is over to visit for the weekend.”<br />
<br />
Ashley listens to Jeff’s explanation, “sounds good so far,” she says, “but, will I still remember you as my big brother?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “since you and me are aware of what is about to happen,” he says, “both of us will still know the truth.”<br />
<br />
Ashley smiles, “good,” she says, “not that we somehow forget and you end up stuck as an eight year old girl.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff says, “that’ll suck. Anyway, I think all is set,” he turns to Ashley, “ready?”<br />
<br />
Ashley nods, “more than ready!”<br />
<br />
Jeff once again chuckles at his sister’s excitement, before confirming the changes he has made.<br />
<br />
After confirming the settings, Jeff feels a weird tingling run through his body, causing him to shiver, “that felt weird,” he says.<br />
<br />
“What,” Ashley asks, who is watching Jeff closely, wondering what will change first.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Jeff says, “I just felt a pins-and-needles sensation run through my body.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” the girl says, “as of now, nothing seems to change,” she adds, sounding disappointed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff says, “maybe this is nothing more than a total… wait! My feet aren’t touching the ground!”<br />
<br />
Sure enough as both look they notice that Jeff seems to be shrinking, Ashley’s eyes widen, “you are shrinking!”<br />
<br />
“Not only am I shrinking,” Jeff says, “I’m starting to even feel… *couch*… younger. Wait… *couch*… my voice,” the transforming boy says, clutching his throat.<br />
<br />
Ashley’s eyes widen in amazement as she watches her big brother slowly shrinking and becoming younger.<br />
<br />
“Now, my head is itching,” Jeff says, scratching his head, “my hair is feels longer too,” his voice already sounding more like a girl’s.<br />
<br />
“Amazing,” Ashley breaths, “and creepy,” she adds.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to tell me, sis,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s body hair have receded into his body, leaving back silky smooth and soft skin. The more he shrinks the baggier his clothes become, his jeans fall to the ground, “he… I forgot to set the program so that my clothes would adjust to my new body.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry,” Ashley says, “I know where mom stores my old clothes. By the way, you already look pretty cute!”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes, “am I,” he asks, his hair stopping to lengthen when they reach the middle of his back.<br />
<br />
Ashley nods, “yeah,” she says, “your face also is also looking less boyish!”<br />
<br />
Jeff then lets out a groan, clutching his stomach, “I… I think I’ve just grown a womb!”<br />
<br />
“Damn,” Ashley says, “sounds unpleasant.”<br />
<br />
“More weird than unpleasant,” Jeff says, “now I can feel my… um… boy-parts starting to retreat back into my body. Feels so weird!”<br />
<br />
“I can imagine that it must feel super weird,” Ashley says.<br />
<br />
Jeff touches his crotch, feeling his tiny bulge shrinking under his already tiny hand, “yeah… super weird indeed,” he says, “and… it’s gone! I really have girl-parts now!”<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” Ashley says.<br />
<br />
“I… I think that was the last thing to change,” Jeff says, he looks up at his sister, “so… how do I look,” the now new girl asks.<br />
<br />
Ashley is shocked, she still can’t believe that this little girl had been her big brother a few minutes ago, but then she smiles, “from what I can see, you look like a cute and very pretty girl!”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes a little, “I… I’d like to see myself,” he… she says, the “girl” then looks down at the floor, “man… I am so high up!”<br />
<br />
“Here,” Ashley says, walking over, “let me help you,” she then lifts her “little sister” of the seat, “whoa, you are super light,” she says, before setting the little girl down.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes, “well,” he says, “you are much taller than me, which makes you stronger than me.”<br />
<br />
Ashley grins, “it kind of feels amazing to be stronger than you for once,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get used to it, Ashley,” the little girl says, “I won’t be like this for ever.”<br />
<br />
“I know,” the other girl says, “that is why I’ll be enjoying every second! Let’s get you out of that to big of a shirt, then you can look at yourself in your mirror.”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushes, “b-but… I’ll be naked,” he says.<br />
<br />
“So,” Ashley asks, her head tilted.<br />
<br />
“well… I’m your older brother,” the “girl” replies, “a boy!”<br />
<br />
Ashley giggles, “you WERE,” she says, “right now you are a girl, like me, so I won’t mind!”<br />
<br />
Jeff hesitates, “I… I dunno,” he says, “it feels wrong being naked in front of my sister!”<br />
<br />
“Tell you what,” Ashley says, “let me go and search for my old clothes, while I’m gone, you can strip out of that shirt and have a good look at yourself!”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jeff says.<br />
<br />
“Oh, by the way,” Ashley says, as she heads to the door, “what would I have to call you? I mean… I can’t call you “Jeff” while you are a girl!”<br />
<br />
“Let’s discuss that later,” Jeff says, “I’d like to get changed first!”<br />
<br />
Ashley nods, “okay, I’ll be back shortly,” with that Ashley heads out the room, ‘I can’t believe that my annoying big brother has become such a cute little girl! Hehe… I’ll defiantly will have some fun with her for sure,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
When Ashley had left, Jeff takes off the large shirt and walks over to his mirror, he gasps when he sees his reflection: in front of him he sees a beautiful eight year old girl with long smooth black hair and a slender body, almost athletic, maybe a little over the average eight year-old, but Jeff has to admit: he does look really cute and pretty. The former boy stares at his new genitals, “man, feels so weird to have nothing between my legs,” the “girl” mumbles, “but… it kind of also feels good. A cock is so annoying sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“You look really good, Jeff,” the voice of his sister suddenly says, causing the little girl to let out a surprised yelp and jump.<br />
<br />
“ASHLEY,” the eight year old squeals, blushing hard as she turns around.<br />
<br />
Ashley can’t help but giggle, “sorry,” she says, setting down a big cardboard box on Jeff’s bed, “here are my old clothes. Would you like a dress or would you prefer to not go that far yet?”<br />
<br />
“Honestly,” Jeff says, walking over to his sister, “I’d prefer to wear pants, at least for now, I might try a dress or skirt later or tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Ashley nods, “okay,” she says, stepping back, “help yourself,” she then says.<br />
<br />
Soon Jeff is wearing a skinny blue denim jeans, a white t-shirt with a heart on the front, white socks and some black mary jane shoes. The former boy turns around, “so, what do you think,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Ashley smiles, “the clothes look really good on you,” she says, “so, about that name issue,” she then adds.<br />
<br />
“Right,” Jeff says, “I was thinking about either “Jane” or “Jess”!”<br />
<br />
Ashley thinks for a while, “I think “Jess” is more fitting,” she says, “it comes pretty close to your real name!”<br />
<br />
Jeff, now “Jess”, nods, “that’s what I thought,” the girl says, “okay, “Jess” it is.”<br />
<br />
Ashley smiles, “so, Jess,” she then says, “what would you like to do now?”</p>
