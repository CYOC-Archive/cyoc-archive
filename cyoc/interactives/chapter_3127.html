<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning has you awakening from a strange yet pleasant dream. As you slowly pull yourself back up to a state of wakefulness, you try to remember the dream you just had. It was such a vivid dream. So vivid in fact that you could swear that it was real. In the dream, you dreamt that you were a large shaggy dog living with a friendly old man on a farm as his pet dog. In the dream you remember waking up at the crack of dawn, being taken outside to relieve yourself and then being brought back inside to have a meaty breakfast. And while you ate from your bowl, your friend groomed your thick grayish black fur coat. You found yourself in the dream liking his gentle touch as he groomed you. And then after he finished grooming you for the day and after you had finished wolfing down your breakfast, you went to your work with your friend. You herded a large flock of sheep for him for what seemed like hours. You also spent some time with him just being by his side out on the fields and being together in your home. The experience was a very pleasant one for you. The dream of being a sheepdog ends when you pretend to go to sleep in the dream and awaken in the real world. 
<br />

<br />
You awaken to find yourself back in the cage where you spent the night. You raise your head slightly off of the make-shift pillow and you just listen to what is happening around you. You hear that your canine neighbors are already up and are having their breakfasts. You then look down at the dog bed that you had been sleeping on and shake your head with wry amusement. You can hardly believe that you actually got a good night's rest on that thing. And you don't even feel sore from sleeping on it. Your body feels as limber as ever. You then stand up to take a better look of your surroundings. Ever where you look you can see the dogs are having their breakfasts. Some are calmly and quietly eating their meals. While others are just wolfing theirs down. And others still are playing with their food by nosing the bowls around with their black, wet noses. A few of the dogs closest to you look up from their meals, eye you and then bark or woof a good morning to you. And you get the strangest feeling deep down inside that you want to greet them with a good morning too. You shake your head with amusement and then smile. You just know that you are not going to forget this experience when you get out of here.
<br />

<br />
You step off of the dog bed that you were just sleeping on. And when you do so, you find yourself feeling a bit odd. You look down at yourself. Your eyes widen a bit in surprise as you take yourself in. The first thing that you notice about yourself is that your clothing just doesn't seem to fit you well anymore. The thin yellow neckline of your light gray, short-sleeve T-shirt is now fitting snuggly against your neck. And there is also a tightness on your T-shirt short sleeves too. The rest of your T-shirt now rests an inch above your waistline and exposes a bit of your chest. The digital wristwatch with its' metallic wristband of segmented links feels too snug against your left wrist. Your blue jean shorts sag a bit in the front and back and you can catch a glimpse of your underwear underneath. Your socks hug your ankles and feet while your shoes seem to loosely fit your feet now. The sight puzzles you until you lift a bit of the T-shirt up and look at your chest. And then you see why your T-shirt and shorts no longer seem to fit you properly. Before you came here, your body wasn't so muscular and well toned. Your arms and legs were better off than your chest with its' small love handles. But now... but now you find yourself staring at a nice six pack of abs where the flab should be. And you also see that your chest is a little more hairer than before too. The way the hair on your chest was arraigned before reminded you a wolf's head. Your nipples form its' eyes. And the two tufts of chest hair that reached up toward your arms formed its' ears. The chest hair tapered toward your belly button to form its' muzzle. But now the chest hair makes the image stand out more. You then drop your T-shirt down and look at your arms. But you don't see much of a difference there because of the work-related exercise you do as a stock clerk at a local pharmacy. Looking down at your legs, you do notice that they look perfect for jogging now. The sight of what has happened to you makes smile bemusedly. You reach up to your head with your right arm and scratch your right ear in puzzlement. 
<br />

<br />
And that is when you receive another surprise. Your hair feels thicker than before. It feels rather bushy and unkempt. You decide to check out the rest of your face just in case that it has changed too. You wish that you had a mirror at the moment to look into. You are curious and befuddled about what you have just seen. With both hands now, you feel your face. You notice that the baby face that you have had for most of your young adult life has been replaced with well toned muscle. You feel a bit sad about that fact because you always found it amusing when people incorrectly guessed your age. They would look at you and see an 18 or a 19 year old when you were at 12 years older than what they guessed. And when you told them your true age, you couldn't help but smile at their reaction. Now you probably look your true age of 32. You feel that your sideburns have grown a bit longer and that you have probably gained a five o'clock shadow from not shaving this morning or from the day before. A check of your eyebrows reveals that like your hair, they too have grown slightly thicker and bushier. 
<br />

<br />
Just as you decide to spend some more time checking your body out for more of those mysterious and slightly welcomed (?) changes, the dogs around you in their cages begin to get excited. They rush to the front doors of their cages and begin to bark and woof and wag their tails happily from side to side. Some even get up onto their hind legs and lean into the door to show off. You notice that they are all looking down toward the end of the kennel that you were trying to reach the other night. 
<br />

<br />
Curious about what they are seeing and being so happy about, you pick up your sagging pants with one hand and walk over to the front door of the cage that you slept in. The dogs continue to bark and woof and wag their tails as you push the front door to your cage slightly open and lean part of the way out into the aisle separating the two rows of cages. You look down the aisle where the dogs are happily looking toward. And coming toward you at a brisk pace that seems to swallow up the distance between you and the end of the room is the most beautiful woman in the world. 
<br />

<br />
Your catch your breath in your throat at the sight of this woman heading your way. Your heartbeat beats loudly in your ears. You start breathing again. And your breathing sounds more like a dog panting. In and out, in and out. You feel like you are going to hyperventilate if you keep breathing the way you do. But you can't help it, the woman heading toward you is so beautiful that a part of you wishes that you were a dog. You wish you were so that you can make her happy. And as she gets closes the distance between you, you can see that she is smiling. She sees the expression and smiles with a knowing smile. You get the impression that she knows what is going on inside your head. Like she knows your innermost desires and dreams. 
<br />

<br />
With a slightly glazed look to your eyes, you watch as she comes up to you. You barely look at her clothing or the clipboard that she is carrying under her right shoulder. All you can see is her face, her supremely attractive face. 
<br />

<br />
She smiles at you and then snaps you out of dreamy reverie with a snap of her fingers. You shake your head to pull yourself out of the little fantasies that you were starting to think about. Fantasies involving you and her together doing a lot of interesting things. When you come to, you watch her as she pulls the clipboard out from under her right shoulder. She looks at you and then gazes at it. She then looks back at you. Behind her you notice that the dogs in the room have gone silent except for the wagging of their tails and their soft panting. They are all looking at you and this woman, this goddess. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Are you Eric Westphal?&quot; She asks you in a very sultry, well practice voice. Her voice makes you want to fantasize again about the two of you being in bed together while she says in that voice of hers about something really kinky. Without shaking your head and making her take that gesture as a no, you banish those desires of lust into your subconscious mind. Have a little respect for her, will you? A little voice in your head tells you. You have just barely met the girl and already you are daydreaming about having some fun with her. So instead of shaking your head, you nod your head in answer to her question. 
<br />

<br />
She smiles that irresistable smile of hers. Her smile makes you feel hot all over. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; She tells you. &quot;I then would like to welcome to your first day of class here at Madame Circe's Canine Obedience School, Mr. Eric Westphal. I am Circe, your school instructor.&quot;
<br />

<br />
You look dumbfounded at her as she says that. What did she just mean by that comment of hers? You ask yourself. What did she mean by saying that this day is my first day of school here? You feel pressured by tons of questions coming into your head about her and this place. You really want to ask her about this place. 
<br />

<br />
Circe ignores the look on your face and closes the distance between you and her. She smiles a wicked smile as she reaches up to caress your chin. Your breath and pulse quicken at her touch. She then reaches up to your forehead and gently brushes away a lock of hair that has fallen down across your forehead. Circe steps back from you and smiles again. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;I just know that you are going to like your stay here, Mr. Westphal. You and I are going to be very good friends. Shall we go now and begin your tutoring?&quot; She asks you in that pleasant sultry voice of hers. 
<br />

<br />
Her caresses push aside those thoughts you had about asking her about this place. You find yourself accepting what she had just said now. And you nod your head obediently. She smiles and caresses your right cheek just below the two moles there. And then she reaches out for your left hand. You give her your left hand and then the two of you begin walking back the way she just came from. You walk side by side with her. Unaware that her presence has brought about some more changes in you. The only thing that you are aware of is that you want to make her happy. To do otherwise would spell trouble for you.</p>
