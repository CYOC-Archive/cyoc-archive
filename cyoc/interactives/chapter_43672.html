<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa was the first to break the silence, &quot;Let's go back and see what else we can do. I want to see just how far we can change things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if someone notices?&quot; Jessica flicked her tail and shuffled her hooves nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as we make it so reality adjusts no one will know a thing,&quot; she smiled wickedly, &quot;Besides, I think Brian would make a great mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica's eyes went wide, then she giggled at taking Brian's pregnancy to the obvious conclusion, &quot;I can't imagine that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With that computer program you got you don't need to imagine it,&quot; Melissa's smile grew wider, &quot;And looking at the size of him I think it might be twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twin girls?&quot; Jessica suggested.<br />
<br />
By the time the two of them got back to Jessica's room they had everything planned out. They were going to set it up so that Brian had given birth to twin girls two weeks ago and that during that time his personality had become increasingly motherly towards the girls while he remained otherwise normal. The details of how he had managed that were not important, the Chronivac could take care of it all.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Brian woke up to the sound of Kimberly crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, mommy's here for you,&quot; he rolled out of bed and went over to the cradles where his little daughters slept.<br />
<br />
Kimberly's crying had woken up Hanna as well, and they were both crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, you're hungry, but I'm here now,&quot; he knelt down next to the cradles and undid the clasp of his bra to free his breasts. Smiling, he picked up Kimberly up and brought her to his chest. In a moment her crying stopped as she began to nurse.<br />
<br />
While Kimberly fed he gently rocked Hanna's cradle.<br />
<br />
Looking down at his two little daughters he sighed contentedly. Every time he looked at the two infant girls he could not help but be amazed that two such perfect little people had come from him. With their perfect little fingers, so amazingly delicate, and the downy hair just starting to grow on their heads just looking at them was enough to make him marvel.<br />
<br />
When Kimberly finished, he gently patted her back until she burped, then he cradled her in his arms until she fell back to sleep. Putting her down he picked up Hanna and fed her.<br />
<br />
Though they were identical in appearance, the two little girls were already showing distinct personalities, something that amazed him even more than how perfect they were. Hanna was going to be the first to talk, he was sure of that, and once she started he doubted that she would stop. Already she was the more vocal of the girls, cooing contentedly as she nursed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you telling me stories already?&quot; he laughed gently.<br />
<br />
Right now all the two girls did was eat, sleep and cry, often at all hours of the night much to his roommate's frustration, but soon enough they would be sitting up on their own and then crawling and getting into trouble. Once that started he was sure that Steve would miss the times when all the girls did was cry.<br />
<br />
Once Hanna was finished he burped her and put her back in her cradle as well. In a few hours, or less, they would be up again needing their diapers changed. The thought did not bother him at all, something he would not have believed when he had first discovered that he had been pregnant.<br />
<br />
Back at the start he had been horrified, unable to think of what it would be like to raise a child, but as the pregnancy wore on he at first became resigned to the fact. He had watched his stomach swell and his breasts grow tender with a grim determination to face what would come. When his breasts started to grow as well the fear returned, though he had known it would happen when he had to go bra shopping he felt at his lowest, but then something amazing happened. When he felt the first kick a kind of wonder settled in. There was something living and amazing growing in him, something that in under a year would come out as a little person.<br />
<br />
At the next checkup he went to he discovered that he was going to have twin girls and from there he was on cloud-nine. Even when his breasts swelled past a d-cup he was not bothered at all. Every change to his body was another step towards the arrival of his girls. He had spent hours pouring over baby name books, asking his roommate what he thought of different names until Steve was sick of it all.<br />
<br />
Then the day came and after a trip to the hospital he got to see, for the first time, the two little girls he had known for nine months. He nearly cried, and then the nurse gave them to him to hold and he did cry.<br />
<br />
That was another thing he would have laughed at before, but now he felt that he was a different person, at least where his daughters were concerned. His goal was now to be the best mother possible.</p>
