<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Samantha closed the door to their home behind her, she started to feel strange. She froze in place, unable to move. Next she felt like her skin was on fire as short brown fur started to cover her hands, as her fingers started to bend and merge together her fingers. Up her arms grew short black fur, as the bones beneath the skin started changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no no no...not again!&quot; Samantha yelled as she started to realize she was turning into a dog again. She started to yell in panic as she fell to the floor abruptly as her legs gave way to her shifting bones. The same brown fur that covered her hands was growing over her dark skin feet and black fur over her legs. Her socks and shoes soon started to come off her feet as they turned into paws of a dog. <br />
<br />
Her once decent sized ebony breasts started to deflate and be taken over by her barreling broad chest. Samantha assumed she would soon feel the growth of several teats along her underside, like she had before when she turned into a German shepherd, but that never occurred. Her sports bra started to stretch over her growing chest and it soon snapped and came off her changing frame. <br />
<br />
Next Samantha felt a very odd feeling in her ovaries, as if they were shifting and moving towards her slit. Soon she felt them start to push their way out of her, as they quickly formed a dark skinned sack. Next she felt her vagina start to push outward. Her clit started growing larger and longer as it took on a bright red appearance. It continued to grow out and formed a fur covered sheathed around it&#39;s base. Samantha was shocked to feel the cool air around her new appendage as she finished growing her new dog penis. <br />
<br />
The black fur was almost completely covered her changing body at this point. Next she felt her face and mouth started to push out. Her ears grew larger and then flop to the side of her head. Her head was reshaped into a dog&#39;s head and soon she looked like any other male rottweiler. <br />
<br />
Samantha was left in shock on the floor, panting from her ordeal. Tom, who was a good submissive greyhound, had just been watched his once beautiful ebony wife transform into a very muscular, very handsome and very male rottweiler. He slowly approached the new dog. He knew it was his wife, but he had no idea how much of her mind had transformed, so he had to be careful. The rottweiler stayed laying on his side breathing heavily. Tom sniffed at Samantha&#39;s head and then gave her a quick lick. <br />
<br />
&#39;Are you okay?&#39; Tom whined to her<br />
<br />
Samantha didn&#39;t say anything for a moment and then replied &#39;I think so....&#39;<br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s tail wagged slightly, at least part of her mind was still intact. <br />
<br />
Samantha continued &#39;what breed am I?&#39; she whined to her husband<br />
<br />
Tom looked over her muscular frame and build and replied. &#39;You appear to be a rottweiler. A very muscular male who would make great puppies!&#39; Tom responded and quickly realized what he had just said. He couldn&#39;t believe it, why had he said that?<br />
<br />
&#39;What?! I don&#39;t want to make puppies with you!&#39; Samantha responded in anger. <br />
<br />
Tom whined and lowered his head in submission &#39;I don&#39;t know why I said that...but I think it was my half bitcg brain YOU gave me...&#39;<br />
<br />
Samantha slowly started to get to her paws. She looked over her body as best she could. She lowered her head to look between her hind legs. She could see her furry sheath and black ball sack. She gave her hind legs a quick shack and felt the sack sway back and forth. &#39;Wow. That feels so weird. How do you get used to these things just hanging here?&#39; she asked her husband. <br />
<br />
Tom glared at his wife. &#39;I have forgotten....&#39; Tom replied snarkily as he turned his rear end to the rottweiler and lifted his tail to show his assists, a dark lipped vagina. <br />
<br />
Samantha looked at her husband&#39;s rear, and that&#39;s when she felt an odd sense of arousal. She looked at the bitch in front of her, presenting herself, almost begging to be taken. Samantha felt her cock started to harden and peak out of her sheath. She started to smell the aroma coming from her husband&#39;s rear end and it just made her even more horny. Her mind was started to fog over with just one thought.....mating. <br />
<br />
Tom looked back at his rottweiler wife. He could see her penis starting to grow and he realized his mistake of showing her his sex. He knew that if he stayed in this position, that Samantha would probably mount him and give him those puppies he wanted! <br />
<br />
Tom decided to...</p>
