<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>It&#39;s been a long time since there&#39;s been an update to this thread. Me and The 1 were having trouble figuring out how to end this particular chapter. Then I realized we were overthinking this a bit. This is supposed to be a website of choices so we&#39;ve left the ending open for others to choose. Hopefully that will make things start rolling again.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a lazy, rainy day. On a normal rainy day, Nat would have a book to show or something else  to do with Mary. This is not one of those days. This is a rare day where Nat and Mary couldn’t find anything to do during one of Mary’s visits.<br />
<br />
Nat and Mary just layed on the floorboards of Nat’s house and stared at the ceiling. <br />
<br />
“So… What about teaching me how to hunt?” Nat asked.<br />
<br />
“That requires us to be outside.” Mary replied.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Nat says nothing for a few moments as she watches a bug crawl on the ceiling. “Hey… Maybe I can go with you out of town someday?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” Mary absentmindedly muttered. She then turned her face towards Nat. “Why the sudden interest in going outside? You had no interest in leaving town before. What changed?”<br />
<br />
Nat kept staring at the ceiling. “Nothing.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Mary sat up. “Did something happen while I was gone?”<br />
<br />
Mary watched Nat exhale a puff a mist. “Nope. Same as always.”<br />
<br />
Mary raised an eyebrow. “Whenever I asked you if you wanted me to take you out outside of town before, you said it was too dangerous. I’ll even go as far to say you are content staying within the town borders.”<br />
<br />
Nat’s looked Mary in the eye. “Yeah? What’s your point?”<br />
<br />
Mary blinked at that. Not even she is sure what it is. <br />
<br />
Mary thought hard on what could be. “Something… feels… missing…” <br />
<br />
Nat rolled her eyes. “Oh yeah? My room is exactly as it was since the last time you were in town.” <br />
<br />
Mary knew she was on to something. But what? “Wait, where’s Seth?” <br />
<br />
Mary could feel Nat averting her gaze without actually looking at her. “Oh, don’t worry about him, He’s fine. “ <br />
<br />
Mary raised an eyebrow. “Really? I haven’t seen him around lately.” <br />
<br />
“I said he’s fine.” Nat let out a puff of hot mist.<br />
<br />
Marry narrowed her eyes. “What happened?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing!” Nat shouted.<br />
<br />
Nat faced away from Mary. Leaving Mary to stare at the back of her head for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
“He left town to discover himself.” Nat muttered.<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Mary replied. “Why didn’t you go with him?”<br />
<br />
“You know why. I’ve never seen what’s beyond the borders. I just… wasn’t ready when he left. The jerk didn’t even wait for me…”<br />
<br />
The next few moments were filled with silence.<br />
<br />
*CLAP*<br />
<br />
Nat looked up to see Mary standing over her with a smile on her face. <br />
<br />
“Tell you what. Let me take your mind off of things. Lay on your stomach. I want to show you something I learned while I was out of town.”<br />
<br />
Nat gave Mary the Lazy eye. “What is it?”<br />
<br />
“They called it a massage!” <br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
Rielleta watched Nat’s memories. <br />
<br />
It seems she had feelings for this “Seth” fellow.<br />
<br />
If she had romantic feelings before, then why hasn’t she “matured” yet.<br />
<br />
Then she noticed something.<br />
<br />
It’s faint, but there is a spark.<br />
<br />
For the most part, Nat’s relationship with Mary is on the level of friendship and sisterhood. <br />
<br />
But what really interested Reilleta… was that Nat had budding romantic feelings for Mary.<br />
<br />
As much as Rielleta respects sisterhoods, she currently cared about corrupting Mary and changing her body into something more fitting to be Rielleta’s new body. <br />
<br />
And if that means twisting a perfectly good family bond into a romance, then so be. Nat certainly has the potential…<br />
<br />
Now to push Nat in the right direction…<br />
<br />
To trigger the lust in such a self-repressed girl, Rieletta would have to work her magic in the place it would be most effective. Dreams were a gateway to the mind and Rieletta was diving deep into Nat’s subconscious. She was looking for where Nat’s womanly desires would be located, even if they were being subconsciously denied.<br />
<br />
Rieletta found herself in a very interesting mental manifestation. It looked much like a spring where the stormy essense of reproduction should be flowing in abundance. However, there was no water at all. The basin of the spring would be made of dry, cracked dirt, if Nat had any concept of earth at all.<br />
<br />
Rieletta put her hand in the dry spring and soon felt what it should be. “Ah, so this is where your storm essence would be,” she said, “A young woman like Nat should be nearly full.” She was certain that if this were Mary’s head, the spring would be almost completely filled with storm essence. She still had a way to go before her vessel was filled and she would be a true woman. But not one drop was inside this spring.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see, that storm essence has to come from somewhere,” said Rieletta, looking around. She then noticed a crevice, one that should be a stream feeding the pool. But it was as dry as a bone, if cloud people even had bones. “Hmm...let’s go to the source,” said Rieletta.<br />
Rieletta followed the dried stream before she abruptly came to a stop. There was a surprisingly vast dam right here. It looked as solid as cloud matter could get. “Now where did this come from?” asked Rieletta before putting her hand against its surface. She nearly flinched back in disgust. This dam was made of pure repression. Everything Nat denied about herself; her womanhood, her sexual feelings towards Mary, even her doubts about her magic had manifested as a wall keeping her storm essence out. No wonder Nat’s reservoir was so dry and her body so slight.<br />
<br />
As a succubus, Rieletta revels in her passions and lack of restraint. A dam of inhibition like this was almost anathema to her. This thing had to go down. But Rieletta couldn’t just smash it open. For one thing, this dam was built rather well. It would take a big hit to make it break open. And Rieletta is not nearly strong enough to do that. Not to mention, doing so would give her away and she did not want that happening.<br />
<br />
No, what Rieletta had to do was start weakening her dam. She could feel so much storm essence behind it. All she had to do was get it started and eventually the dam will break under the pressure. And Rieletta had a good idea of how to put in the first crack.<br />
<br />
She could sense that Nat was still dreaming. Her mind had drifted back to that backrub that Mary had given her. This was perfect, just where she could start working her influence. She sent her sexual energy into that dream, slowly altering it.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
In the dream, Mary was still rubbing Nat’s back, but now she was putting more pressure on it. Slowly, her hands started wandering over more of Nat’s body, rubbing her sides and hips as well.<br />
<br />
Nat was quick to take notice. “Mary, what are you doing?” she asked, feeling some unease about how good it felt.<br />
<br />
“You are so tense,” said Mary, “You need to relax more.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, this-this isn’t relaxing,” said Nat as she felt Mary touch her stomach.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it is relaxing,” said Mary, “You know how uptight with tension you are?”<br />
<br />
“But this isn’t help-” Nat yelped as Mary felt her chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, so much tension,” Mary murmured, “You’ve been holding back so much.”<br />
<br />
Nat turned around sharply. “Mary, I don’t know what’s gotten into…”<br />
<br />
Nat found it hard to concentrate. Instead of the childhood version of Mary, she was seeing the near-adult Mary. Moreso actually. Her clothes had vanished, leaving all of her mature body exposed. A pair of storm gray nipples stood out on her breasts and a glistening cleft was waiting between her legs.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want this?” Mary’s voice sounded different now. “Don’t you want to feel these curves? Don’t you want some of your own.”<br />
<br />
“But...but I can’t,” Nat protested, feeling very flushed.<br />
<br />
“Of course you can.” Mary moved forward, allowing her large breasts to bump against Nat’s flat chest. “You need to stop holding back, stop denying yourself. You’ve been a girl long enough. It’s time to be a woman.”<br />
<br />
Nat squirmed against Mary&#39;s touch. Did she really want this? Did she want to be a woman? Did she want to be like Mary? With Mary?</p>
