<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You'll be okay with me thinking this over?&quot; Tabby Choir asked Molly and I as we made our way out to return home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Molly nodded, &quot;So long as you decide to run. You'd do a good job I'm sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I don't run, you'll be mad?&quot; Tabby retorted with a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not mad,&quot; I smirked, &quot;just disappointed. The school district could probably use a smart intelligent individual to get thinks right. You can't do any worse then what they currently have at the post.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't take his animosity toward you two as a sign of his work ethic,&quot; Tabby warned, &quot;he's actually done a fairly decent job, for the most part. The only issue that I'd probably be able to beat him on is on his treatment of Molly...&quot; Tabby then turned to face Molly directly, &quot;...you'e been so good with Veronica at the school. She simply adores you. I can't believe all the hoops the principal and the superintendent are making you jump through are necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is more then enough for us,&quot; I answered, &quot;Molly and I may not be human anymore, but we are still &quot;people&quot;. We have all the same rights as you do... as he does. By law, he can not simply persecute us because we aren't human anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And neither of us have really lost much of what made us &quot;human&quot; before,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;it took a lot of getting used to... especially for me... but we've both managed to get used to it... to accept what we've become and what we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And no attacks on cattle or people,&quot; Tabby nodded, &quot;It'll probably be used in that lawsuit against your friend Leona. Her formula doesn't entirely change people into mundane animals... and well... you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;All too well,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think will happen if the people filing the lawsuit win?&quot; Dave wondered curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd probably see more animal people springing up across the country,&quot; I commented, &quot;although Molly and I are still at a loss as to why ANYONE would want to become something other then what they were born as.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some could say for love...&quot; Dave commented with a smirk, &quot;you know that if you two have cubs... their future husband or wife... or whomever they decide to mate with are likely to become tiger-people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll cross THAT bridge when we have to,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that would be a different thing altogether,&quot; Molly added, &quot;if someone falls in love with one of the Animatrix Fun House victims, our our children and agrees to become an animal person to be with them... that is one thing. The people behind the lawsuit simply want to be furries.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave and Tabby slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next morning, when I arrived at the police station, I found that there was a lot of activity going on. It looked as though a few of the other patrol officers were being kept at the station for a briefing or something like that. Which made me assume that the search warrant for Dusty MacClure's property had either arrived, or was due to arrive today, which meant that we would get a chance to thoroughly check his property and make sure he was or was not the murderer of Joshua Marksman. Officer Howard was waiting with Officer Jenkins, and motioned for me to follow them toward what functioned as a small conference room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Officer Wayne,&quot; Officer Howard spoke, &quot;you up for the day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I nodded, &quot;are we ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;though there are a few things I want to go over with everyone that will be involved in carrying out the search.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and followed him and Officer Jenkins into the &quot;conference room&quot;. There were about four other officers waiting there. Officer Howard moved to a point in the room where he could address everyone while Officer Jenkins and I essentially joined the group of officers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, gentlemen, tiger, and lady,&quot; Officer Howard spoke once he was certain he had everyone's attention, &quot;our latest big case has reached a point where we will need to search a residence to get the evidence we need to either confirm the guilt or innocence of our prime suspect.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then paused for a moment and gestured of Officer Jenkins and I.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you know, Officers Jenkins and Wayne have been investigating the murder of Joshua Marksmen,&quot; Officer Howard continued, &quot;and their investigation has lead to the R.A.M. member, Dusty MacClure. This morning, I when I came in, I was informed that the search warrant will arrive at eight thirty this morning. Now considering that Officer Barnes was nearly killed in the process of searching Pierre Beauregard's property, we will not be executing the search of MacClure's property with two officers. All of you will be carrying out the parameters of the search warrant. At least one officer is also to monitor MacClure's actions during the search.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods among the other officers present.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officers Jenkins and Wayne will be leading the search and will be in charge of all things related to the investigation,&quot; Officer Howard continued, &quot;and they will brief you on what you will be looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard then motioned for Officer Jenkins and I to approach where he was standing. Officer Jenkins and I then went through the things that we were looking for. Predominantly ammunition casings, or the whole bullet if possible, and specifically for the tracking number on them. If they matched the number on the bullet that was recovered in the autopsy, we would likely have our man. Or at least the weapon used in the murder.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
MacClure's ranch was quiet when Officer Jenkins parked her car on his driveway with the other officers parking their cars behind us on the street. Unlike the first trip out, we did not hear any gunfire, but I then, I doubt someone would be target shooting between 8:30 and 9:00 in the morning. Regardless of that, every officer was wearing bulletproof vests, in case MacClure proved to be as fanatical as Beauregard had been. If he shot at us, the Kevlar vest would protect us from harm. The quiet was ended when we reached the front door, with MacClure actually opening it before Officer Jenkins could either knock or ring the doorbell.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; he demanded, &quot;I've answered all your questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Officer Jenkins nodded, &quot;it is however what you muttered to yourself that leads us to believe that you are the murderer of Joshua Marksman...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What I muttered?&quot; Dusty MacClure responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you whispered to yourself,&quot; I replied, &quot;questioning how Marksman could have defended Beauregard.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at me in surprise. As if he truly didn't know how good my hearing was.<br />
<br />
&quot;My ears are not for show,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no proof!&quot; MacClure finally spoke, &quot;You can not arrest me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are not here to arrest you at the moment,&quot; Officer Jenkins presented a copy of the search warrant, &quot;we are here to search your premises and property for any evidence that may indicate that you... or weapons owned by you were used in the murder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The warrant,&quot; I added, &quot;gives us the full right to search your ranch for the evidence. If we find anything that does incriminate you... THEN we will arrest you.&quot;<br />
<br />
MacClure seemed to flinch slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or, you could attack me now, and you'll be arrested for assaulting an officer of the law,&quot; I growled, &quot;and you'd be in trouble regardless of whether or not you and/or your gun was used in the murder.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, MacClure backed down, somewhat submissively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; he spoke, &quot;You won't find anything, but you may try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for cooperating,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied and motioned to the other four officers, &quot;we will begin the search. Officer Wayne, here, will keep you company. Make sure you don't pull some stunt like what Beauregard did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid pigs,&quot; MacClure grumbled under his breath, again forgetting that I could hear him, &quot;Government's got no right to tell me what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave him a low snarl, making him back away, and allowing Officer Jenkins and the other officers to enter the house. As they began to fan out, I turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;In future,&quot; I spoke to him, &quot;you will learn to keep your private comments to yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They shouldn't have to be,&quot; MacClure growled back, &quot;people should know how dangerous you are! If a tiger escaped from a zoo they would tranquilize it... and if that failed, they would kill it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not a mundane tiger,&quot; I answered, &quot;I have all the strength and ability of one... but my human mind isn't replaced by animal instinct... I can feel a tiger's instincts, but I am in control of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot; MacClure said defiantly.<br />
<br />
We then stood there quietly for about ten minutes. When that time had passed, Officer Jenkins returned and I heard the back door opening and closing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Find anything?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We found the Colt revolver,&quot; Officer Jenkins nodded, &quot;obviously Mr. MacClure's, but the ammunition with it has a different tracking number. Which means it was probably a different batch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See? I didn't do it,&quot; MacClure smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are however checking the grounds and other buildings,&quot; Officer Jenkins continued, &quot;if he's already fired the round from the batch that has the same tracking number, we'll find it among the shell casings used at his private target range... even if it takes all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this MacClure's eyes widened in shock, and before I could do anything he lunged at Officer Jenkins.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOOOOOOO!&quot; he howled as he lunged forward, tackling Officer Jenkins to the floor.</p>
