<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, after school, Jared had baseball practice.  Kevin knew that Jared was always too tired after practice to shower, so he came home, still in his uniform, and took a nap on the couch.  Kevin also knew that his parents wouldn't be home from the city until later tonight.  Since Jared was 17, he was in charge until their parents got home.  This was going to be Kevin's chance to have some more fun with Shaggy!<br />
<br />
Kevin was already home when Jared got there.  He was playing video games up in his room when he heard the door clost.  He knew the routine, first Jared would kick off his cleats, then he'd get a drink from the fridge.  Finally, he would lay down on the couch and fall asleep.  It only took about 15 minutes for these activities to run their course.  <br />
<br />
First, Kevin went downstairs and checked on his brother to make sure that he was definitely out.  After discovering that Jared was indeed sleeping soundly, he went upstairs and retrieved the medallion and collar from Jared's nightstand.  Kevin made sure to wear gloves while handling the mystical objects, so that he wouldn't suffer the same fate.  He figured it would be much more fun to play with Shaggy than to be him.  Kevin hooked the medallion on the link where a dog tag would go and slipped back downstairs to his sleeping brother.  <br />
<br />
Jared had rolled over on his side now, which made this job that much easier.  Carefully, Kevin slipped the collar around Jared's neck and fastened it in place.  He was almost shaking with the excitement of watching this unfold!  Keeping his distance seemed like a good idea, so Kevin sat on the coffee table a few feet away.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes nothing seemed to be happening.  He wondered if Jared needed to be awake for the transformation to take place.  He got up and started toward the couch when he noticed the first signs - fur was sprouting on his brother's face!  He quickly took his seat again and watched for more changes.  He could see the hair on Jared's head change from a dark brown to white and grey as his ears lengthened and his nose started to push out.  <br />
<br />
Next came the hands and feet.  Kevin watched as fur started sprouting from his brother's hands, and his stirrup socks seemed to puff up with the added hair underneath.  Jared's hands and feet, now paws, retracted into his uniform.  Kevin could see how his brother's spine was re-shaping itself, becoming more curved, and now he had a bulge at the back of his baseball pants.  Jared continued to sleep through this as though nothing was happening.  He was almost completely a dog again.  His cock and balls were re-forming under the uniform, so Kevin assumed the transformation was complete.  He started undoing his brother's shirt.  He figured he might as well get Jared undressed so that they could start playing as soon as he woke up.  <br />
<br />
Once he got Jared's shirt off, he took off his socks and pants.  He hadn't counted on the compression shorts or jockstrap and cup underneath, but given Jared's new shape, they came off easily.  The only thing left was his red Under Armour shirt.  As he started tugging on it, he realized he may have shaken his brother too much.  Jared's eyes opened as he licked his lips.  Still half-asleep, he looked down to see his brother trying to take his shirt off from him.  He tried to ask what Kevin was doing, but all that came out was a bark!<br />
<br />
Jared rolled around on the couch trying to get himself upright again and figure out what was going on.  He ended up falling on the foor, instead.  Kevin rushed over to him and hugged him.  &quot;Shaggy, are you all right?  Did you hurt yourself falling off the couch?&quot;  By now, still groggy, Jared had figure out what happened, even if he didn't yet fully understand how his brother had transformed him.  &quot;Let me get this shirt off of you so that we can play, how does that sound?&quot;, asked Kevin.  As soon as Jared heard the word 'play', he felt the excitement building up within himself.  His tail started to wag and he he sat up on his haunches so that Kevin could remove the shirt.<br />
<br />
Clothes lay strewn around the couch, so Kevin decided to pick them up first.  At least if they were all on the sofa, he would have less to do later.  He picked up the uniform and put it on the couch, but then he noticed the jock and cup a few feet away. He crawled over to them so that he could throw them up on the sofa too, but Shaggy though play-time had started.  Kevin threw the jock toward the couch, but Shaggy caught it in his mouth in the air.  The canine side of his brain took over and he sensed the human smell on the item.  It seemed familiar, but he couldn't quite place it.  In the back of his mind, Jared was grossed out at what was being held in his mouth.  However, the doggy side felt the hard plastic and foam inside and started chewing on the cup through the fabric, as though it was a chew toy.<br />
<br />
Kevin grabbed hold of the straps and pleaded with Shaggy to let go, but it just turned into a tug of war.  Kevin's strap gave way and he fell backward, as Shaggy ran off with his new toy and chewed it as hard as he could.  Kevin, not sure what to do, looked toward the kitchen where Shaggy had run off to.  He noticed the baseball mit and ball on the table.  Thinking quickly, he ran and grabbed the ball and shouted to Shaggy, &quot;Come here boy!  Let's go outside and play fetch!!&quot;  Shaggy looked up from what he was working on and instantly dropped the now mangled jock and cup on the floor in favor of something better.<br />
<br />
After an hour of playing fetch, first with the baseball, then with a frisbee, Shaggy and Kevin were both getting tired.  Kevin knew it wouldn't be too much longer before their parents came home, and he still had to pick up inside.  Better yet, since Jared was in charge, he'd let him pick up the mess!  Kevin told Shaggy that it was time to go inside and rest.  As much fun as he was having, Shaggy was ready for a nap.  Meanwhile, Jared was enjoying himself as much as ever, and wishing that he didn't have to change back, but he knew that he had to.  He couldn't just go on living as a dog, could he?<br />
<br />
Once inside, Kevin lead Shaggy over to the couch and took a seat.  He patted the cushion next to him, motioning for Shaggy to get up there with him.  Kevin reached over and got his gloves off the table.  After putting them on, he took the collar off Shaggy and removed the medallion.  He put the red Under Armour shirt back on Shaggy and slid the medallion down inside.  This transformation was much faster than the first.  Kevin noticed the changes almost immediately.<br />
<br />
Shaggy's hair was rapidly receding back into his body, and the hair on his head aws turning dark brown again.  Next he could hear cracks coming from Shaggy's back as it re-formed into Jared's spine.  A few muffled cries escaped Jared's now human lips as the rest of his bones and muscles went back to the way they should be.  Finally, sitting upright, Kevin watched as Shaggy's sheath retracted and Jared's cock and balls flopped back out again, making him fully human once more.  Jared looked completely spent and leaned back into the couch, not paying any attention to his lack of clothing.  <br />
<br />
The first thing he noticed was that his shirt was on backwards.  &quot;Couldn't even redress me right, could you?&quot;, he joked, as he reached over and messed up Kevin's hair.  &quot;We had a lot of fun, didn't we, bud?&quot;, Jared asked.  Kevin just nodded in agreement, with a big smile on his face.  &quot;Well, let's get this mess cleaned up!&quot;, Jared said, as he got up off the couch.  He reached down and grabbed his compression shorts, pulling them into place.  &quot;I guess you have a lot less modesty when you're a dog&quot;, he laughed.  &quot;Hey, where's the rest of my uniform?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be all right here on the sofa&quot;, Kevin said.  &quot;No, I'm missing my jock and cup...can't play ball without them!&quot;  Kevin had forgotten about them, but he was surprised that Jared had.  After all, Jared was the one chewing on them!  &quot;That's right, they're out under the table&quot;, Kevin replied, still wondering why Jared didn't remember.  He followed his brother out to the kitchen and they both went &quot;yuck&quot; at the same time when Jared picked the wet, broken, disfigured garment up off the floor.  &quot;What happened to this?&quot;, Jared asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You don't remember?  First you thought I was playing tug of war with you and the jock, then, when the strap broke, you thought the cup was a chew toy!&quot;  &quot;I don't remember any of that&quot;, Jared said, a little nervous.  Had his body gone on auto-pilot as Shaggy?  He really couldn't remember much of what had happened after he fell asleep on the couch...  Kevin looked just as perplexed, but Jared didn't want to let on that he couldn't remember all that he did while in his dog form.  &quot;Oh yeah, that's right!  Well, I guess I'll have to get another one before practice tomorrow, won't I?&quot;, Jared joked.  &quot;Yeah, I guess so!&quot;, Kevin added...both of them wondering what would happen the next time they did this!</p>
