<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">..you were in a clean, sanitary bedroom. You were tucked under some plain white bedding on a fairly big bed. the room was about the size of your old room, but the walls were an off white color as opposed to your normal blue. An oak door was in front of you, and two windows were to your sides. A dresser was placed in the far left corner, and a tv stand was placed into the other. You got up and noticed you were dressed in a cotton t shirt and sweatpants, both of which were pretty tight on your voluptuous figure. Examining yourself, you were the exact same as you were last night: vixen anthro with bombshell proportions. You walked over to the tv stand, where there was a pamphlet that read the title &quot;Welcome to Anthro World!&quot; Opening the pamphlet, you began to read:<br />
<br />
Intro:<br />
Welcome to your new life as a citizen in the new Anthro World! Recently, scientists have discovered a planet that was capable of hosting life. Interested, we decided to launch project: Repo. Basically, we have enough humans in the universe, so why not make a new species? That&#39;s where you come in. You have been randomly selected to be genetically transformed into an anthropomorphic animal and come live on Anthro World. You have by now seen what anthro you have become. Once you are ready, please refer to the map at the end of the pamphlet, head over to the town hall, and get registered as a citizen in this new world. Pretty soon, we will be opening up the planet for human tours. by then, you should have acclimated to your new life. The humans will be able to visit all the same places and live like the anthros on the planet. Please do not act differently around the humans. If you want, you can sign up for our Human-Anthro Relations program, which can give you a chance of returning to earth. That is entirely up to you. You should have noticed by now that you have a collar on. This is to be worn at all times, except when in the shower. Failure to be seen with these on will result in a specific punishment. If you act against our code of conduct in any way, the collar will automatically administer the punishment. the punishments can be anything from a simple shock to body modifications to death, depending on he nature of the misdemeanor. Please note that the punishments will more than often be body modifications. Anyways, that is all. Please get dressed and head down to the town hall to become a registered citizen.<br />
<br />
This is a lot to take in. Your old life is over, and you are forced to live on this bizzare anthro planet for the rest of your life. You cant comprehend it all. You decide to comply with what the pamphlet said. strutting over to the dresser with your new feminine walk, you grab some clothes out. to your surprise, they actually look pretty nice. you grab a purple crop top that will show off your ample cleavage and flat belly and a pair of jean shorts that not only compliment the shirt, but your rear end as well. You also grab a bra and panties, despite not knowing how to put them on, and left for your bathroom.<br />
<br />
stepping out of your room, you saw a room across from you that said &quot;Jeanne&quot;, another door that said &quot;W.C.&quot; (water closet) to your left, and a flight of spiral stairs that led downstairs to your right. The shower was running, and someone with an amazing singing voice was singing &quot;Believer&quot;. Steam was seeping through the door cracks, and you slowly realized that there wasn&#39;t going to be hot water left for you. You walked over to the door and knocked sharply. The woman inside stopped singing immediately. &quot;Hang on, I&#39;m almost done!&quot; She called to you. You noticed there were benches in the hall, and sat down on one, placing your clothes next to you. A minute or two later. she stopped singing and the water shut off. Another minute later, Jeanne came out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel. She was a husky anthro with d cup breasts, wide hips, a big butt, and thick thighs. She looked around until she saw you sitting. &quot;Okay, bathroom&#39;s all yours!&quot; She said with her beautiful voice. She bounced back to her bedroom and shut the door with her feet. Weirded out at the fact that she didn&#39;t freak out that you were in her house to begin with, you grabbed your clothes and hopped into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
The bathroom was sparkling clean, with shining white tiles everywhere. Even the toilet tooked like it was brand new. You placed your clothes on the sink counter and your eyes darted to a poster on the wall with instructions on how to remove the collar:<br />
<br />
1. Locate and press the button on the back of the collar.<br />
2. Remove the collar from your neck. The collar will start a 30 minute countdown, giving you time to shower.<br />
3. Place the collar in a spot where it will not get wet. Water can cause severe damage to collar nd be worth a fine of $500.<br />
4. Shower.<br />
5. place the collar back around your neck and click it closed.<br />
Warning: If you do not finish your bath or shower within 30 minutes, the collar will administer a punishment when worn again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that seems simple enough.&quot; You said. You pressed the button and the collar unlocked itself. A 30 minute timer started on an led display inside the collar. You placed the collar under your towel so it wouldn&#39;t get wet, tore off your t shirt and sweatpants, were surprised to see that you weren&#39;t wearing underwear under them, and hopped in the shower. The hot water on your new fur sent you a weird sensation, like you were being wrapped in expensive silk sheets. You got lost in the sensation before you looked around to see what you were going to be getting clean with. You saw a red loofah and a blue loofah, along with two bottles of something called &quot;Fur Wash&quot;. The blue loofah had some hairs on it and the bottle under it was opened, so you assumed that was Jeanne&#39;s and used the red one and new bottle. The bottle&#39;s contents looked like normal shampoo. You put some on the loofah and scrubbed it into your fur. Once you got to every spot you needed to clean, you rinsed off and turned off the water. You usually took short showers. Hopping out of the shower and picking up your towel, you saw you had six minutes left of shower time. You dried off your head and neck, and placed the collar back onto your neck. It clicked back into place, and the timer shut off. With your crisis averted, you dried off the rest of your body and put on your clothes. It took you a minute to figure out how to put on the bra, but once you did, it was easier than you thought it would be. Then you put on the panties, which were also just like normal underwear. The purple crop top slipped on nice and fit snugly around your chest. The jean shorts were short enough to give the boys a show, but not to get you in trouble. You exited the bathroom and headed for your room to get some shoes. Jeanna screamed from her bedroom and came running through the hallway toward the bathroom. She started searching frantically for something, but she didn&#39;t tell you what. you stepped into your room and looked at the bottom of your dresser. you had a couple pairs of sneakers and flats, but a lot of high heels. You decided to go with an almost new pair of sneakers, which fit perfectly on your new paw feet. Feeling a rumble in your stomach, you decided to head downstairs. Jeanna ran through the hallway, clutching her collar, and ran into her room, slamming the door behind her. &quot;Oh, I hope she only gets shocked.&quot; You think to yourself. &quot;She has a great figure, it would be a shame if it got messed up.&quot; The male part of you seemed a little selfish, but the female part was genuinely afraid for your new roommate. A bad physical punishment could ruin her life. you wish that she would get off easy, but something told you she wouldn&#39;t. The scream you heard next confirmed your suspicion. Afraid of what you might see in there, you went downstairs instead.</p>
