<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With only two small drinks of the river's mysterious water, a simple doe had become a humanoid doe-woman, and then a massive, eight-foot tall goddess of muscle with shapely hips and heavy breasts.  The wolf had drowned in that same river, or at least she thought he had.  Now he lay on the river bank, no longer a starving wolf, but a skinny, starved humanoid wolf-man.  He had soaked in the water for minutes, swallowed massive amounts, and even breathed the strange water into his lungs.<br />
<br />
With a frightened anticipation, the doe watched, wide-eyed.  She had defeated the wolf only because she was so much larger, so unnaturally strong that she was able to crush rocks with her bare hands.  Even then, it had taken a great deal out of her.  Should the water have the same effect on the wolf...<br />
<br />
The wolf cried out suddenly, voice more human than animal, like her own.  He arched his back, raising his tiny chest.  His penis, as small and pathetic as the rest of the mangey creature, stood suddenly erect.<br />
<br />
The doe stepped closer, but slipped behind a tree.  She pressed up against the wood, peering around and watching closely.<br />
<br />
The starved wolf-man suddenly lurched forward, sitting up violently.  He leaned forward, clenching his sharp teeth tight.  There was a stretching sound, and as the doe watched, the wolf's back shook, shoulders tensing and swelling against tight skin.  His back and sides began to fill with flesh, ribs and spine slowly disappearing as swelling, growing flesh inflated his furred skin.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the wolf put a massive clawed hand down on the ground, grown much larger than the rest of him.  Skinny muscles tensed as he tried to push himself to his feet.  As the doe watched, the skinny muscles first tensed, then began to flex.  The bicep swelled, growing from almost nothing to the size of a softball, then a bowling ball, then even larger.<br />
<br />
The wolf pushed himself up with his massive, rapidly growing arms.  As he bent his legs to stand, his feet suddenly swelled to incredible size, followed by growing, hardening calves and suddenly massive thighs.<br />
<br />
The wolf's cries of whimpering pain had changed to a low, deep-voiced moan.  The doe recognized the sound as pleasure, and remembered the comforting warmth that had spread through her own body, the strange alien pleasure of the change.  She pressed closer to the tree she was using as cover, her breasts pressed tight against it.  As she watched the wolf's body grow larger and harder, she started to rub against the tree, rough bark rubbing her sensitive nipples.  Pleasure tingled in her massive breasts, and down her spine, and she pressed her body even closer to the tree, clinging to it desperately.<br />
<br />
The wolf's fur had begun to grow.  He had been mangey, balding.  Now his rough coat was shaggy and ragged.  His back bulged suddenly, muscles swelling up and growing as his massive shoulders became broader.  With a groan, he brought his hands to his scrawny neck, just as it began to swell and thicken with muscle of its own.<br />
<br />
He turned suddenly, facing the doe, though his eyes were shut tight as he moaned in pleasure.  She gasped in shock nonetheless, watching as his once-scrawny chest became a swelling, massive thing of hard muscle.  She watched as the stomach beneath his fur turned to a tight, perfectly defined six-pack.  And still he continued to grow.  Becoming taller, more massive and muscular.  His legs were like trees, his biceps larger than the doe's head, perhaps larger than two of her heads, she thought.<br />
<br />
His coat of fur was full and thick now, a gorgeous mane of silver and black about his head.  The doe moaned, rubbing her breasts harder against the rough tree.  She could imagine the feel of that fur in her hands, soft and warm against her body.  She wanted to touch those massive biceps, hang off the broad shoulders.  She lifted one muscular leg suddenly, wrapping it around the tree.  She lifted her hips, rubbing her hot crotch against the solid wood.  She pressed her face against the tree, closing her eyes, imagining the solid tree was the wolf's hard, solid muscle.<br />
<br />
She opened her eyes as she heard a sudden grunt, and stared at the wolf again.  He held his hands down, cradling a pair of massive balls that had just grown between his legs.  They hung there like a pair of grapefruit, and he moaned as he gently squeezed the firm, massive testicles.<br />
<br />
The doe gasped, her eyes widening, as the wolf leaned back with a groan.  His penis, small and pathetic, was suddenly growing and swelling.  Hot and hard, the erection grew out from him, glistening wetly in the sun as it swelled up, longer and thicker.  The wolf's scent assaulted the doe, filling her senses as she stared at his massive, growing organ.  She reached down, sliding two fingers into herself, hot and heaving.  The rutting season was on her, she was certain of that much now.  But these fingers wouldn't do, even if she shoved in her entire fist, it wouldn't match what the wolf was growing.<br />
<br />
Still growing, in all ways, the wolf threw back his head, letting out a loud, triumphant howl.  The doe whined, rubbing herself and holding the tree so tight that her massive strength was cracking the old wood.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, finally finished, the wolf looked down at himself.  The doe studied him even as he studied his new body.  He was truly a giant, ten feet tall, even larger than her eight.  His chest was huge and bulging, powerful muscles twitching under tight skin and luxurious fur.  Huge broad shoulders nearly dwarfed his head, and his biceps were perfectly formed, and massively swollen.  His legs were like tree trunks, huge and powerful.  His ass a tight, muscular perfection under his tail.  His erection, waving slightly over his huge balls, was well more than a foot long, and so thick that the doe wasn't certain she could get both hands around it.<br />
<br />
He reached down uncertainly, placing one big hand over the swollen head of his erection, and moaned in pleasure.  The doe met his moan, and then there was a horrible cracking, as the tree she had been clinging so tightly to broke beneath her, splintering and falling.  She stumbled back from it, blinking as her hiding place fell into the river.<br />
<br />
The wolf stared at the doe.  The doe stared at the wolf.  Both surprised, panting, and terribly, obviously aroused.</p>
