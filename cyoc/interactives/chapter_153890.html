<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You&#39;re still bent over the pile of sticks, rubbing one of them against the others in a desperate attempt to create a flame, when the cold finally gets you. You start to slow down, your glacial-paced rubbing slowing down to immobility as your once gooey body hardens to icy stiffness once again. Of course, you try to resist once again, willing your slimy, foxy body to move with all of your will, but this time, it doesn&#39;t respond. Not a single part of your body twitches.<br />
<br />
In your last moments of consciousness, you&#39;re vaguely aware of the white wolf slime in front of you desperately staring at you. She seems to be trying to melt your icy body with her eyes alone. As you watch, her eyes begin to glaze over as well, slowly going from emotive to inert. And then she freezes, changing from a living creature to an ice sculpture comparable to your own companion.<br />
<br />
Your own body seems to be mimicking your once slimy companions as even the cracks that showed themselves on your surface have frozen over.  Your mind starts to slow, your eyes long past glazed over. Was this it for you? Were you destined to remain as a fox slime ice sculpture, frozen deep below the earth in a cave as cold as ice? You no longer have time to ponder this question. You freeze solid, becoming stiff and inert, unthinking and unfeeling.<br />
__________________________________________________________<br />
It was odd. One moment, you were freezing solid in a cave of ice and the next moment you&#39;re... well, standing still. On some sort of pedestal. In the middle of a huge castle made of ice. What just happened?<br />
<br />
Of course, the first thing you try to do is look around, but you find that you can&#39;t. Your body remains as stiff as a sculpture. Frantically, you try and struggle a bit, swirling your slimy body around inside of its icy shell, and to your surprise, it works! With a loud crack, you manage to move your arms out of their grabbing position and return them to your sides. With another noisy crackle and the help of your stiff yet movable arms, you wrench your torso back into an upright position. You try to get your legs moving, but they seems firmly stuck to the platform that you seemed to be placed on. Now that you can move, if stiffly, you take a good look around yourself. If you could move your face out of its slight smirk, you would frown.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re right about your earlier observation. You do seem to be stuck in the middle of a castle made of ice, just based on what the walls looked like. Unlike the ice cave you were stuck in before, the walls in this building look to be put together as if the building was built from brick, but the chill that the walls give off tell you that they are certainly made of ice. You seem to be in the middle of some display hall or something, as the next thing that you notice confirms.<br />
<br />
Lining the walls from one end of the hall to the other seems to be a bunch of ice sculptures, each planted on a pedestal made of ice. Each individual ice sculpture is drastically different, from their shape and size to their pose to their colors. There is, however, one trait that they all share. They all look like slimes.<br />
<br />
Each and every one of the statues look like a frozen variant of some kind of slime. Passing your gaze up and down the hall, you see everything from wolf slimes to cow slimes, each silent and stiff with an icy stillness. If your face wasn&#39;t still frozen in its slight smirk, you would gasp. It&#39;s at this moment that you hear a slightly muffled noise coming from down the hall. Someone was coming! You quickly rearrange yourself back into the position you awoke in, bending forward at the waist, reaching your hands out as if you were grabbing something, locking your body in place, and staring off into the distance. You don&#39;t want to risk being discovered, especially if the creature that&#39;s coming happens to be the one who put you down here.<br />
<br />
&quot;One must wonder how I&#39;ve managed to acquire so many.... pieces,&quot; a husky, confident voice purrs. The voice doesn&#39;t pose it as a question rather than a fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes Ma&#39;am!&quot; squeaks another voice, this one a bit higher in pitch and.... familiar? The familiar voice seems terrified, to say the least.<br />
<br />
As the two voices come closer, you feel the air around you becoming colder and colder, forcing your outer layer to freeze solid once again. As you watch helplessly, two slimes stop in front of you, continuing their conversation as if you don&#39;t even exist.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a simple process, really,&quot; that husky, confident voice states. This voice belongs to what looks like some sort of white bear slime, their hulking form matching you in height on your pedestal. This slime is clearly a female one, based on her obviously exaggerated assets around her chest and hips, but something about her seems off. From what you can tell, her whole body is covered in a thick layer of ice, complete with small icicles dangling off of her broad limbs, but she seems to be moving perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I simply wait in my castle until one of these beauties,&quot; the white bear slime continues, gesturing towards you and some of the other ice sculptures, &quot;Decides to fall into my caves.&quot; She pauses and turns to the slime that accompanied her, a predatory grin stretched across her maw. &quot;That&#39;s where I found you, my lovely servant,&quot; the white bear slime says, reaching out and gently placing a hand on the shoulder of her companion. The other slime anthro nods quickly and mutters, &quot;Y-yes Ma&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is when you realize something. No wonder that voice seems so familiar! It belonged to the blue slime vixen that you escaped the lab with! But what was she doing here? No, that isn&#39;t important right now. You quickly calm yourself down and focus, listening intently to the conversation happening in front of you.<br />
<br />
The white bear slime sighs deeply, which seems to make the air around you even colder. &quot;That&#39;s all you ever say,&quot; she groans, rolling her eyes and leaning over the blue slime vixen.<br />
<br />
The blue slime vixen shrinks back, her eyes wide with fear. &quot;W-what do you mean, Ma&#39;am?&quot; she says nervously.<br />
<br />
The white bear slime gives her a frown. &quot;I mean to say that you bore me, dear,&quot; she says, a bored tone in her voice. &quot;I think it&#39;s time you rejoin the rest of my collection.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blue slime vixen gasps and immediately turns, making a run for the other end of the hall. She doesn&#39;t get far. In a motion too quick for you to follow, the white bear slime wrenches the blue slime vixen off of the ground and slams her against the ground, pinning the panicked slime vixen to the ground with her icy arm alone. &quot;That&#39;s more like it,&quot; the white bear slime purrs, leaning towards the blue slime vixen&#39;s body until their snouts almost touched.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no!&quot; the blue slime vixen whimpers, struggling weakly against the white bear slime&#39;s grasp. &quot;N-not like th-this!&quot; You can feel the air around you getting colder and colder with each moment that passes, chilling the frozen parts of your to even further density. It&#39;s getting harder and harder to maintain consciousness in the cold, but you force yourself to endure it. What was this white bear slime doing to your friend!<br />
<br />
&quot;If you didn&#39;t want this to happen, my servant,&quot; the white bear slime began, slowly lowering her free arm towards the blue slime vixen&#39;s face, &quot;You should have been a bit more entertaining.&quot; With that, the white bear slime clamps her hand on the blue slime vixen&#39;s snout and squeezes.<br />
<br />
A wave of icy cold seems to emanate from the white bear slime, then all goes silent. The white bear slime gracefully returns to a standing position and smiles down at the blue slime vixen. &quot;There,&quot; the white bear slime purrs, &quot;That wasn&#39;t so hard, was it?&quot; Of course, the blue slime vixen offers no response, as she was nothing more than an ice sculpture now.<br />
<br />
If you could move you face through the icy shells that held it in place, your face would have contorted in fear. What was that?! What did that white bear slime just do?! The white bear slime reaches down and grabs the frozen blue slime vixen, lifting the ice sculpture into the air with little effort, and turns to look you directly in the eyes. &quot;I think you&#39;ll do fine as a servant,&quot; she purrs, her icy gaze unflinching. You can&#39;t help but feel a chill run up and down your spine, even though you don&#39;t have one.</p>
