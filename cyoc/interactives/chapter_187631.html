<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate and Rose looked dumbfounded at the women who sat on the rock, no the mermaid who sat on the rock for her dark green and lime green tail was visible partly out of the water and her green hair looked natural even if that color was not natural in nature. Her darker skin marked her as middle eastern maybe north African and her sea green eyes where locked on the two of them. She was beautiful with a modest size but well for her size bust, an athletic body build and a sexy core. If they had seen her on the street they would have assumed she worked as a model but she was a mermaid.<br />
<br />
They then looked at themselves as they lied on top of each other, Nate still within Rose. Both of them had changed a lot but both where focused on the fact that they had tails instead of feet. Rose pulled out of Nate and rolled over landing on her back in the sand before sitting up. Nate beat her up to a sitting position a second before. <br />
<br />
They should have screamed; they should have called for help instead they just looked at themselves and each other.<br />
<br />
Nate looked down at his own dark gold, orange and black merman’s tail in a mixture of horror and wonder, beside him Rose was looking at her own dark red, bright red and pink tail in the same mixture.<br />
<br />
Both had changed, their tails extended out at least a foot or two longer then where their legs would have normally been. This normally would have made the tail fluke out of reach but with a couple of test flicks it was clear that their new limb was stronger and much more flexible than their legs had ever been. <br />
<br />
The scales traveled up to their waste line, Rose shot a look at Nate, just in time to see his now much larger manhood slip back within the tail before all but disappearing behind some scales. The scales traveled to their waste line and all but stopped, it wasn’t a sold line and feeling behind them it was clear that the scales traveled to the small of the back in the back and made a broken V shape down to the waste line with some scales here and there above that line mostly around the gills. <br />
<br />
Both of them had much stronger and sexier cores, Rose had a narrower waste then she ever had before, and Nate could see all his muscles without flexing but it wasn’t an over the top muscular look either. He was broader in the shoulders and his arms seamed stronger as well. He saw that Rose had grown at least a cup size going from the board of Large B to large Cs and they where perky even without a bra on. Her neck was narrower as well and her hair was brighter and so where her green eyes. He looked into those eyes, that was actually the first thing he had noticed about her, her bright green eyes they were brighter now. Rose was looking at him now, he had always been handsome to her but now he looked like he belonged in the movies, he was strong yet gentle and that bright smile was still there.<br />
<br />
“Hello, I am Shelly I am a mermaid from Atlantis…who are you two?” inquired the Mermaid as Rose and Nate looked back at her.<br />
<br />
They should have screamed; they should have called for help but they didn’t something within them was quickly getting used to their new bodies and was quickly starting to like it.<br />
<br />
“I am Rose and this is my boyfriend Nate.” Answered Rose as she looked at Nate and then at Shelly. “Did you do this to us?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Answered Shelly “Atlantis needs more mermaids and merman to repopulate because of human pollution, come on I will explain more in the water it isn’t safe for a merperson outside of the water.”<br />
<br />
With that she slipped down into the water and disappeared.<br />
<br />
“Shall we?” inquired Nate as Rose nodded, grabbing her bikini top as she pulled herself toward the surf. It was a much tighter fit but she loosened some straps and it went back on. Nate left his swim trunks behind just like she left her bottom. It was hard work but they pulled themselves into the surf and dove into the water, taking their first breaths of the sea. <br />
<br />
Part of their mind was screaming this was wrong that they where human but as they moved out into deeper water and did playful flips and spins in the water that part was fading away. They quickly found Shelly floating in the water a couple of inches below the surface.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the Sea, now I want your help to transform your friends.” Said Shelly “Will you help me?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Said Rose even as the little voice in her head which was still human was screaming at her to say no, to fight back but the call of the sea was too strong. “I can’t wait to share this gift with our friends.”<br />
<br />
“Me to.” Said Nate as the three of them surfaced, they where far enough away to be nothing more then dots to the humans but merfolk eyes where better and they saw their friends on the shore. The boat with three of their male friends had moved a little more offshore, the women where still sunbathing and a guy worked on the grill alone. “Who to transform next?”</p>
