<br />
Hailey laid in the layers of blankets, still suffering from blood withdrawal, if she didn’t feed soon she would become feral and tear apart these survivors. <br />
She closed her eyes only for a moment but when she opened them again there was light coming from the boarded up windows, it was the next day.<br />
When the door to the bungalow opened she thought she would get burned alive by the sunlight but she saw that the sky was still covered in dark clouds, the sun was shining but no direct sunlight would hit the island.<br />
Jonas was accompanied by who she assumed was James, he was an older man with dusty brown hair and a beard. The two were carrying a long surfboard with a badly injured man on it. They set the man in the corner next to Hailey and tried to tend to his wounds but after a while they had given up, he was dead and there was nothing the small group of survivors could do.<br />
Kelly had broken out in tears, she couldn’t take all these deaths, Jonas escorted her outside and tried to calm her down, James had left to find others, leaving the vampire alone with the dead man.<br />
<br />
Hailey got up and searched the medical supplies they’d retrieved, and with luck she found a cooler with blood bags. She checked to make sure the others were still gone and drank from them, soon her strength had returned and her vampiric appetite was sated. <br />
Once she had drank enough to fully recover she quickly returned beneath the blankets before the others returned.<br />
Jonas, James, and Kelly entered the hut and Jonas checked on her and was glad that she was recovering, believing that resting had helped her to get better.<br />
<br />
—————————<br />
<br />
Henry was getting tired of this island, he’d encountered and fought against the undead that infested this island. The lycan had determined that a powerful dark wizard was responsible for these monsters and the storm. He was relieved that the sunlight was blocked by the supernatural clouds as his partner wouldn’t be killed by sunlight. The worst part was that none of these zombies appreciated his dry pan quips. <br />
<br />
As he rounded back to the coast he could see a hoard approaching, making his way further up the beach he saw three people enter a nearby bungalow. On one of them he caught Hailey’s scent, wearily he approached the hut and kicked the door open, cocking his hand cannons at the inhabitants.<br />
Immediately they all placed their hands up and he looked in the corner and saw his partner wrapped up in blankets on a cot.<br />
<br />
“Who are you people and what have you done to my partner?!” He growled.<br />
<br />
“Stop Henry! They’re just civilians, they saved me!” The vampire said, emerging from her cloth cocoon.<br />
<br />
He lowered his pistol’s slightly and turned to the blonde, she looked healthy. He knew she must have been injured in the crash and had to have drunken blood to heal.<br />
<br />
“And the crash? Your… “condition?” He asked cryptically, not wanting to give away her true identity as a vampire.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I found a metrical case, I uh… found what I needed.” She explained.<br />
<br />
Immediately he spun his guns into their holsters, relieved that she was able to recover without hurting anyone.<br />
<br />
“You said she was your partner, are you police or something?” Kelly asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea, we’re with “S.T.A.R.S”” he quipped.<br />
<br />
“What that?” James asked.<br />
<br />
“No we’re not, he’s just fucking around, we’re with the government.” Hailey said, not amused by his reference. <br />
<br />
“Okay, well I’m Jonas. This is James and Kelly.” The young man said and pointed to his companions.<br />
<br />
Henry closed the door and pooped on a nearby chair, licking his leg up on the table.<br />
<br />
“I’m Agent Mitchel, this lovely lady is Agent Meyers, we’re with a special task force and we’re here to stop whatever happened on this island.” He said.<br />
<br />
“You’re with the government? Are you going to evacuate us?” Kelly asked desperately.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we’re going to stop whatever had been going on here and you’ll be rescued once we’ve done that. I need you to tell me what you know.” He replied.<br />
<br />
“We don’t know exactly. Four days ago everything was normal and then this storm came out of nowhere, then those things started attacking everyone. Anybody who was bitten by those things became one as well. Me and Kelly are lifeguards, James is our supervisor. We tried to save the others but things happened too fast, we couldn’t—“ Jonas explained and trailed off in sadness.<br />
<br />
Henry got up and put his hand on Jonas’ shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about that, you did good but now you have to keep each other safe. Don’t worry, we’ll take it from here, just barricade yourselves in once we’re gone, this will be over soon.” He comforted.<br />
<br />
He motioned for his partner to leave with him and the two agents left for the main part of the resort, hopefully there they could find more answers and get one step closer to saving this island.<br />
<br />
As they made their way through the jungle they found a footpath that was light. As they walked along it Henry spoke up,<br />
<br />
“What happened to your boots?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“They were ruined in the crash, so was my jacket.” She explained.<br />
<br />
“Do you plan on fighting the zombies with your fists, I mean I know you could but that just sounds exhausting.” He said jovially.<br />
<br />
“We’ll get you some more clothes at the gift shop.” He joked.<br />
<br />
“This place has to have an armory for the security, we’ll find weapons there.” She continued.<br />
<br />
Hailey brushed him off with a slight huff and quickened her pace. They continued on the path that led towards the denser part of the resort.</p>
