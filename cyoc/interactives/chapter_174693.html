<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Roxanne, also called Rox by her acquaintances, is a 20 year old college student. She had a peaceful life, good friends and didn&#39;t have many problems. In spite of everything she did not have a boyfriend, not for lack of candidates since some had already asked her for dating, but out of insecurity. It turns out that she had a big secret that she feared their reaction to when they find out.<br />
<br />
Rox went to the bathroom to take a shower, which was always the last thing she did before bed. As usual she started to take her clothes off by her blouse and then her bra, leaving her D-cup breasts free, then she took off her skirt and stopped, looking at the bulge in her panties before she took off her last piece of clothing, which allowed her 8 inch dick to hang between her legs. While she took a shower she took the time to jerk off.<br />
<br />
After the shower she sat on her bed and looked at her cock a little. She thought about her life for having genitals of both sexes, and wondered if she would undergo surgery to remove her cock, but whenever she thought about it she realized that she was more afraid of losing her male member than to have her secret discovered by someone. Soon she lay down and slept, having no idea what was going to happen to her.<br />
<br />
The next morning the alarm clock woke Rox, who immediately got up and looked for clothes to wear, but she found it strange to find some trousers between her clothes even though she only had skirts. She thought her sister was the one who had made a mistake and put her clothes in the wrong wardrobe, so she just ignored it, got dressed and went to breakfast before leaving for college. Everything went smoothly all the way until she arrived at the law school room, which was what she was studying, but after that she had one surprise after another.<br />
<br />
Things started to get weird when a girl she didn&#39;t know appeared in the room and came to her saying &quot;I looked for you everywhere Rox, we are already late for the warm-up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Warm-up? What are you talking about? And who are you?&quot; Rox asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny. Don&#39;t think that just because you are the best swimmer on the team that you can skip class. Now let&#39;s go, we&#39;re out of time.&quot; the girl said and left the room pulling Rox by the arm, giving her just time to grab her backpack.<br />
<br />
In the hallway, Rox let go of the girl and said &quot;Hey, enough of that. I don&#39;t know who you are and you are surely mistaking me for someone else. Now leave me alone or I&#39;ll be late for class.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your problem today Roxanne? First you don&#39;t show up for class. Later I was informed that you were seen arriving at the university and I went out looking for you just to meet you in the law school room, which is strange since you are not even enrolled in the subject. As if that were not enough you say to me, your best friend, that you don&#39;t even know me. Do you have any idea how much it hurts me?&quot; tha unknown girl said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am enrolled in law school, look at my student ID card you will see that I am telling the t....&quot; Rox said but stopped when she saw her student ID, because it was not a law student but a physical education student. &quot;What is it? My student ID card is different.&quot; she said surprised, because even if someone had made a fake to set up a prank with her no one had a chance to change since she last checked it out the day before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s enough. Stop this game and let&#39;s go to class.&quot; the unknown girl said<br />
<br />
Rox wanted to keep trying to escape, but ended up giving in when, guardingg her student ID card in her backpack, she saw that there was a swimsuit inside that she was sure she never put there. She followed the girl, who took her to the locker room, on the way, noticing the tag on her backpack that indicated that her name was Lila. There she changed, standing with her back to the girl, hoping she wouldn&#39;t see her balls between her legs and thinking about a way to hide the bulge that would remain in the bathing suit, not to mention that she feared having an erection in front of her others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do this right now, Rox? You know that seeing your naked back makes me hard.&quot; Lila said taking Rox by surprise, especially when mentioning the word &#39;hard&#39;.<br />
<br />
Rox couldn&#39;t help it and looked at Lila, much to her surprise the girl had a 9 inch hard cock between her legs with a pair of golf ball-sized testicles just below.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lila, it can&#39;t be. You have a dick too.&quot; Rox said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I have a dick, I would be a freak if I didn&#39;t.&quot; Lila said. She then approached Rox and made her hands on the wall, and rubbing her hard dick between Rox&#39;s legs, she said &quot;Now that we&#39;re late it&#39;s okay if it takes us just a little while to get to class. You made me hard and you&#39;ll have to bear the responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rox, despite the surprise, was also a little relieved to have found someone like her, so she didn&#39;t even resist when the strange girl pushed her cock into her pussy. She liked it so much, mainly because she had a desire for someone to fuck her pussy someday, that she too got hard quickly and started to stroke her cock.<br />
<br />
It was almost 5 minutes before Lila came, making Rox come also when she felt the unknown girl&#39;s cum inside her.<br />
<br />
When their orgasms ended they were caught off guard by 3 girls who entered the locker room, all wearing swimsuits as they came from the pool.<br />
<br />
Rox was nervous not only because she was caught having sex, but also because someone else had discovered her secret. The situation only changed when she realized that she could see in the swimsuit of all three an outline that made it clear that they all also had a dick and were hard.</p>
