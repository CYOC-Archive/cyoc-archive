<br />
Shannon McCormick stood in front of the dining room sliding glass door of her family&#39;s Washington abode. A modest double-wide situated in a housing development within walking distance of the school, things hadn&#39;t worked out as planned after their big move.  Elsewhere in the home were her two children, Heather and Seamus.  Her husband, Conor, was in training at his new factory job and wouldn&#39;t be home for several hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad&#39;s going to meet us there?&quot; called Heather as she sat in her room, at her dresser, running a comb through her unruly curly hair.  Seamus, her brother, was audibly in the shower up the hallway.  &quot;His new job&#39;ll let him take time off so soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what they said, dear.  We&#39;re all going to meet up tomorrow for landmarks in the big city, and tomorrow night, you and your brother will get to go to arcades, mini golf, or whatever you like while your father and I—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Whohoo&#39;, yeah, mom,&quot; Heather groaned.  &quot;I don&#39;t need the details.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be happy for me,&quot; the still young-at-heart mother said as she chopped broccoli for lunch.  Her oversize bust jiggled with each chop as did her big poofy head of deep red, curly hair.  &quot;It&#39;s not all that common for adults our age to be so sexually active.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Mom!&quot;</i> Heather screamed, though she was laughing as she did.  <i>&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear about your hyper-active, middle-aged libido.&quot;</i> She slammed her comb down on the dresser.  &quot;How are you this much of a cougar <i>and</i> monogamous?&quot;  A half a second passed before she followed that up with: &quot;Nevermind, don&#39;t answer that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your father and I are very happy together,&quot; Mrs. McCormick assured her daughter.  &quot;And I&#39;m happy you and your brother are doing your sports together, looking out for each other.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;The Wolves have been good for both of you.  I&#39;ll be sad when Seamus goes off to college next year... then you soon after.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you won&#39;t,&quot; Heather laughed, standing up and moving to the doorway to yell towards the kitchen.  &quot;You and dad&#39;s first night together in months while he&#39;s been job-searching!?  You&#39;ll be too busy with your next kid to miss either of us too hard!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. McCormick screeched, throwing a small of broccoli at Heather&#39;s face.  Her whole body jiggled.  &quot;No libido talk, huh?&quot; she asked accusingly.  &quot;I&#39;ll have you know... that is <i>indeed</i> the <i>plan!&quot;</i> the mother laughed while Heather&#39;s mouth dropped open in shock.<br />
<br />
<em>That Night...</em> ———————————————<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, my love... but now isn&#39;t the time&quot; the text message said.<br />
<br />
&quot;ann being a distraction&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; responded Shannon.  &quot;I&#39;ll call you when we get to the hotel.  Then we can have ourselves some long-distance time together&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Campbell spoke up, her Jamaican accent breaking through from her dark face: &quot;Hopefully not as much force as Officer Nannery,&quot; she said, speaking to Mrs. Ann.<br />
<br />
The well-stacked mother just rolled her eyes.  &quot;She just invoked the name of Nannery,&quot; Mrs. McCormick typed, swiping her finger across the touchscreen display to make words.  &quot;I&#39;ll bet you Mrs. Ann is going to ask &#39;Who&#39; just to set her off.  Bitch is the worst mood-kill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;is that a challenge&quot; came Conor McCormick&#39;s response.  &quot;i&#39;m all yours. laying in bed, boxers dropped&quot; he added a moment later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on&quot; responded Shannon, right before there was a lightening strike, hitting a tree near the back of the bus.<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Oh!</i>  Good heavens!&quot; Mrs. Ann lost her composure, speaking fast and about two octaves too high.<br />
<br />
Mrs. McCormick chuckled.  &quot;Why do I get the feeling she&#39;d respond the same way if a <b>[shark]</b> bit her?&quot; she wondered aloud.  &quot;I don&#39;t look forward to the day that&#39;s as much a rise as you can get out of me... &#39;Good Heavens!&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Ann was still sitting at the farthest back of the bus, and Shannon was just a row ahead of her, laying across the pleather seat with her feet partly into the isle.  The little message indicator that noted Conor had been typing suddenly vanished without a new message appearing.  Blinking, Mrs. McCormick glanced at the top of the phone to see she had two bars still on signal.<br />
<br />
A long moment passed, and then another... her one hand at her waist as she tapped on the phone with fingers rom the hand that held it.  &quot;Fall alseep? D:&quot; she typed, then hit Send without fixing her typo.  But... the little blue arrow didn&#39;t do anything, and her message just sat there.  &quot;Huh,&quot; she wondered, and tapped it again but once again the message just sat there... it didn&#39;t even try.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone else just lose text?&quot; Shannon asked without even sitting up in her seat.  She heard a few affirmatives, including from some of the cheerleaders.  &quot;Oh well,&quot; she sighed, but then saw Mrs. Ann standing at her feet.  &quot;Problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like a damn fool,&quot; Mrs. Ann said, remarking on the younger woman&#39;s blouse and cargo pant combo.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you look like the Crypt Keeper,&quot; remarked Mrs. McCormick as she turned her eyes back to her phone screen.  &quot;If you want me to move my legs, you just have to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have to explain manners to someone with such a big stick up their ass they snapped it off at the end to make themselves a cane,&quot; responded Shannon before she bent her knees up to move her feet out of Karen&#39;s way.  &quot;Don&#39;t hurry back,&quot; she added as Mrs. Ann moved forward up the isle.<br />
<br />
After a moment, Shannon McCormick smiled to herself.  Taking a deep breath, she slipped one hand down under her pants&#39; waistline with the other hand opened up her Photos App and selected the Private Album there.  Therein were some of the poses she&#39;d had Conor take, each subsequent one as she swiped left showing him in less and less garb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... Sorry, sugarplum... but I can&#39;t wait till tomorrow...&quot; she said a little more breathless than she intended.  Rather than being concerned at her sudden horniness, the context of the situation blinded her to anything else.  The two of them had been talking about this for weeks, and if she&#39;d already been at the hotel by now as planned, a video call would have been a good opening act to the next night&#39;s plans.<br />
<br />
But instead, alone at the back of the bus, Shannon McCormick reached into her panties and felt her wetness there.  A firm feeling at the back of her ass didn&#39;t freak her out, but instead became imagined in her mind&#39;s eye as Conor slowly pushing his rod lengthwise up and down her cheeks.<br />
<br />
It became rougher to her... like sandpaper... and it made her squirm for a moment.  &quot;Not so rough,&quot; she said breathlessly.  As if to compensate, all of the skin of her heart-shaped ass shifted into the scales of shark... dermal denticles, just like the tail that had been pushing itself down between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; she said, as she lightly brushed a finger over he own clit.  As the tail grew longer, the skin at the back of her legs scaled over.  As the fin grew out, her pace increased... and just before she was to cum, she took a breath and removed her hand.  Not for long, but just for long enough that she wasn&#39;t so close to climax.<br />
<br />
The arousal stayed, however, and therefore so did the changes.  And as Shannon brought herself back up to speed once more, her waist was pushed a little wider in the front by the growth of pelvic fins.  They too were hard, and her hands hesitated as her right wrist rubbed against them.<br />
<br />
Shannon opened her eyes and looked down at herself, these new wide fins at her crotch pushing her pants down.  &quot;Well... this is new,&quot; she said, partly in a daze, but aware enough of the sandpaper feeling that she wanted it to stop.  Soon enough, the fingers on her right hand shifted to have the same scales and her press-on nails popped off from the pressure.<br />
<br />
It was a different texture now, but it no longer hurt, and she carefully touched herself again, fearful of the pain... but whatever her skin, her sensitive parts were now protected... and growing.  As her snatch opened wider, she felt a protrusion pushing up from her pelvic fin on the right, mirrored by another one pushing up on the left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claspers,&quot; the veterinarian said, never having seen them on a human being before.  The malleable, yet somewhat always hard, cartilage-based sexual organs of a male shark.  She dropped her phone.  Her human-skinned left hand going up to her left breast, while the other stroked one of her two claspers.<br />
<br />
She was pretty sure that shark penises didn&#39;t work like this.  But as her claspers ended in just a bit of a mushroom head, she had to assume that it was a human-shark hybrid... and in her mind, she envisioned giving Conor a handjob while he mashed his hand into her breasts.<br />
<br />
All around her, there was movement, but she didn&#39;t care.  She came, squirting semen from internal testes to her left and right sides out both heads, leaving her wondering why he hadn&#39;t cum on her face.  Her hips jerked again, and more white fluid hit the seat front to her right and the back of the seat to her left.<br />
<br />
Down behind her, pressing against the seat, was a full tail ending in the caudal fin of a bull shark, flicking a little to the left and right as she came.<br />
<br />
In the next moment, she squirted from her pussy as she came yet again, locking firmly in place all that had changed so far.  She laid there in the glow for a moment before part of her brain yelled, <i>What the fuck!  You&#39;re a fish!  Get up!</i> and she shook her head as if her mind was lifted from a cloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Shannon asked herself, &quot;I don&#39;t even deal with aquatics, brain,&quot; she argued dimly from the remaining bliss.  But when she tried to sit up, she couldn&#39;t... because her tail had grown down one of her pants legs until it could no longer fit... then it had split the leg, and shredded everything, her panties included.  Everything below her waist was now half on the floor, and her claspers were laying atop her blouse, lightly leaking semen onto her front.<br />
<br />
Mrs. McCormick rolled over onto the bus floor with a thump, ending up on top of what remained of her cargo pants.  Quickly, she stood up, situation be damned.  No one else was on the bus but Ms. Hemlock who was standing at the front of the bus, looking back towards the sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;When did we stop?&quot; Shannon asked Mary, having lost all track of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Few minutes ago,&quot; responded the bus driver, unable to see Mrs. McCormick&#39;s lower half behind the seat directly in front of her.  &quot;You mind leashing Achak and bringing him out?&quot; she asked.  &quot;There&#39;s kind of a meeting going on... Emergency meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sound calm for an emergency,&quot; Shannon chuckled, trying to not think about the fact her pussy literally smelled like fish and she had no pants that would fit.  &quot;But, yeah, I&#39;ll be right out...&quot; she nodded, trying to get some limited privacy by having Ms. Hemlock leave.<br />
<br />
And she did... and then Shannon was left with her thoughts.  Looking to her left wrist, she saw it was after 10:30.  <i>Where did the time go,</i> she wondered, before trying to rest a hand on her belly and instead touching her claspers.  <i>Oh.  Right.</i>. She took a breath.  &quot;I <i>must</i> not be the only one with this... <i>this</i> must be the emergency,&quot; she nodded to herself.<br />
<br />
Reaching up to the overhead compartment, she pulled out her silver, blue, and black Wolves duffel bag.  Reaching inside, she pulled out a pair of black yoga pants with blue and silver stripes down the side.  Reaching into her purse, she pulled out a pair of nail scissors, and looked at the pants carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s always something,&quot; she sighed, handling the situation rather well.<br />
<br />
<em>Moments Later...</em> ———————————————<br />
<br />
Andrew Farminga&#39;s voice came over the rain and crowd murmur.  Shannon had just missed a little of what he had to say, but the next thing she heard over the storm was: &quot;Raise your hand if you&#39;ve been transformed and you <i>don&#39;t</i> have a tail!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does a tailfin count?&quot; asked Shannon softly.<br />
<br />
One parent, Mr. Uri Katz, chuckled and turned to look back at her as she had Achak on a leash.  &quot;This is crazy, huh?&quot; he asked her, unable to see her tail from the angle he stood.  &quot;Transformations and tails,&quot; he said.  &quot;It&#39;s storming and they&#39;re trying to prank us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. McCormick just stared at him.  &quot;Yeah, Uri... a very elaborate and sand-papery prank,&quot; she frowned.  Quickly, but not harshly, she pulled on Achak&#39;s leash to direct him over to the grass.  As she turned, Mr. Katz could better see the four foot shark &#39;tail&#39; that protruded from just above her heart-shaped ass.<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s eyes went wide.  &quot;Are you alright?&quot; he asked, moving over towards her and under the overhang at the edge of the parking lot, away from the others.  He was wearing mostly black, jeans, and shirt with a black leather jacket over the top.<br />
<br />
&quot;As appendages go, I could have worse,&quot; she offered.  Her black yoga pants were cut so that the waistband was intact.  Her claspers, always hard, were pressed up against the backside of her blouse.  &quot;Actually... I guess I do have worse,&quot; she considered aloud.  Wiping her forehead with her right hand she winced at the feeling of sandpaper from those denticle-scales upon it.<br />
<br />
Uri moved under the overhang near where she was taking Achak of into the grass.  It was warmer, lit, and drier there.  The wooden structure was held together with steel rivets, and a number of moths had been attracted to the light up above.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t get over the woman with the huge shark-tail was just casually walking the wolf-looking mascot of the team.  &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed, loudly.  &quot;I may be dealing with a physical trauma,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;And, at this point, a scream and some wine would probably do me good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; came the voice of Seamus McCormick.  The two parents looked towards the cabin to see the boy running towards them, his large fox-tail straight out behind him.  &quot;It got you too,&quot; he said, seeing her better as she stepped over towards the light.  She blinked at his reaction.  &quot;The curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You fox?&quot; his mom asked, a little detached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, pulling around his orange tail with the white tip.  Stepping over to him, she put her arms around her son and hugged him.  &quot;Curse or no... you got the best luck, yeah?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Seamus, the fox-therian, smiled.  &quot;Yeah... I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Kats made a blowing sound with is mouth, and both mother and son looked over at him.  He was waving his tan arms around, swatting at the air.  &quot;<b>[Moth]</b> in my face,&quot; he offered apologetically after he realized he&#39;d interrupted a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone else is heading inside,&quot; Seamus said.  &quot;We&#39;re going to try and figure this out and get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
His mother blinked.  &quot;We can&#39;t get out of here?&quot; she asked, having been... distracted through the whole event.<br />
<br />
Mr. Katz motioned out to the buses.  &quot;Road&#39;s vanished.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shannon took that in stride.  &quot;Ah.  And no one&#39;s got cell service?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Basically,&quot; her son said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seamus looked over his mom and her changes, then looked her in the eyes.  &quot;You don&#39;t sound too good, mom.  Let&#39;s get you someplace to lay down,&quot; he said, motioning towards the <b>cabin in the woods</b> that might as well have been a real hotel for how large it appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she remarked.  &quot;I get the feeling ya&#39;ll are gunna need a well-rested vet.&quot;</p>
