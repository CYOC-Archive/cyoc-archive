<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Bro, I got just the thing!&quot;, Derek dimly smiled as the roided behemoth bounded off to the front desk and disappeared into the office. <br />
<br />
Just then, two college freshmen entered the gym. The local college had just started classes, and fresh faced students were out exploring their new town. <br />
<br />
&quot;Blake, this doesn&#39;t look like our kinda place dude.  The guys here are huge.&quot; The shorter of two was taking in the two new roid heads talking to each other at the counter.  Dressed in a plain white t-shirt and baggy shorts, he felt rather intimidated with his paunchy flab around these muscled-out men. He put his hands through his close cropped brown hair nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just check it out, Sean,&quot; Blake seemed intrigued at the display of muscle around him. He was taller and thinner of the two. No body fat, but no muscle either. He was wearing an old Gold&#39;s gym T-shirt with the phrase &quot;Eat Clean, Train Hard&quot; on it. He&#39;d taken scissors to the shirt and cut out the arms and most of the side so you could see through to his bony torso. He&#39;d always wondered what it would take to get some serious muscle, but never took the time to learn. Ideas of what he could do at a gym like this passed through his thoughts as his eyes looked out under his mop of unruly blond hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you bro&#39;s here for a workout?&quot;, Derek had come back out from the office with a tray of small cups. He sat the tray down on the counter as he addressed the newcomers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm..&quot;, Blake had to admit he was a little taken aback by this juiced up guy. His eyes scanned the man&#39;s obvious roid gut and settled on his &quot;BORN 2 B JUICED&quot; tattoo. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw come on guys, we&#39;re running a special for new students today! Day pass fee is waved and you get to try our new pre-workout!&quot; Derek gestured to the tray. <br />
<br />
Being in college, Blake wasn&#39;t one to turn down a free offer. &quot;Oh - OK, sure.&quot;  He picked up two cups, handed one to Sean. Sean glanced cautiously at his cup, &quot;you sure about this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake responded with a smile and a &quot;cheers&quot; gesture, up-ended his cup, closed his eyes and downed the contents. <br />
<br />
Derek poked his two roided brothers and whispered &quot;watch this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The contents of the cup went to work as soon as it touched Blake&#39;s lips.  His jaw instantly enlarged, as his face squared up. Blond hair fell out as blond fuzz took its place, the hair line receding past his temples. His brow expanded, giving him an almost caveman appearance. <br />
<br />
He now had a very square head that widened into a huge jaw. As the liquid passed his throat, muscle and sinew exploded into traps that were so big, Blake really didn&#39;t have a neck to speak of anymore. Huge thick traps gave way to delts as big as his former head, which in turn led to arms at least 24 inches around filled with veins crisscrossing the expanding flesh. <br />
<br />
As the liquid traveled inside his chest, meaty dense pecs blossomed out of nowhere while his back spasmed into a thickness he would have never dreamed possible. Easily outgrowing his shirt, it shimmered briefly as it became a XXXL stringer tank, pulled taught against his mass, with only a minimal amount of fabric on his expansive back, showcasing some mild acne. The tank&#39;s neckline dropped so low you could easily see the cleavage of his new muscle tits. His nipples pointed straight down from the sheer mass of pec muscle he had.  The expanse of his pecs now meant his biceps would be forever jockeying for space with his outer chest.  His abs hardened as his belly button became an outy and his abdomen blew out into a hard, solid roid gut, pulling the fabric of the tank so tight you could see the deep etchings of each brick of his eight pack. The Gold&#39;s gym logo and motto on the tank top blinked and was replaced with a logo for Roid Bros. Gym and &quot;Juice&quot; Bar with the motto &quot;EAT CLEN, TREN HARD&quot;. <br />
<br />
His legs simply exploded, deeply etched quads becoming impossibly dense and as big around as his former &quot;chest&quot;, and calves that were absolutely huge. As his quads filled his shorts to breaking, they began to rip, but instead of tearing, they &quot;ripped&quot; into a dark blue pair of spandex box cut shorts. Normally the skin-hugging garment would come down to mid thigh, but on the new behemoth, his quads pushed the fabric only a few inches below his crotch. His glutes swelled impossibly as the now globes showcased his massive squatter&#39;s ass. The mass in the back pulled his shorts tight against his modest member. That was to change, though, as a finishing transformation, the prominent bulge on display in the spandex shrunk to a slight bump. <br />
<br />
The arm that brought the cup down, was huge, easily 4 times as large as the arm that had lifted it not 5 seconds ago. The eyes opened, a definite fog over them, as the education being learned at the nearby college was discarded. <br />
<br />
The three roid heads looked at their latest convert, dumbly laughing and jabbing at each other over their good job. This was by a long shot the biggest out of them. The brute standing before them wasn&#39;t a retired athlete, it wasn&#39;t a powerlifter just putting on mass for mass&#39;s sake. This creature was a young roided-out mass monster bodybuilder. This was the result of endless punishment and pushing the body as far as it could go, then blasting through human plateaus with all chemicals available. The college freshman now could pass for his late twenties due to the roid abuse; acne was on his back, a dusting of it on his delts and chest too, the effect of hard roids on an already enhanced young hormonal profile. But this mass monster didn&#39;t care, it lived for size and density. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. Salty.&quot;  The groggy bovine voice was impossibly low, rumbling out of the mass of pecs hanging like a ledge on its chest. It&#39;s chin almost touching the top of the upper pecs as it talked.  &quot;Wha--&quot; it blinked, shook its head, scrunching it&#39;s brow, trying in vain to clear the fog that was now a permanent part of him. &quot;Wha- What happened?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We turned you into a roid boy now, bra! A fuckin&#39; huge one at that!&quot; Derek and the other two smiled at the new beast. &quot;Go ahead, give those huge muscles a flex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still confused, unable to think, Blake raised his arms into a double bi pose and squeezed hard. Veins popped all over him. This was weird. Wait. It wasn&#39;t. This was normal. No it wasn&#39;t. What was this confusing. He went into a large spread, his back could block out the sun. This shouldn&#39;t feel weird. It felt right, though. He tried to think about it, but he just couldn&#39;t think well anymore. He&#39;d latch onto something and the fog would just take it away again. He shifted to a most muscular, his pecs exploding as all of his veins popped into stark relief, his skin growing red from the sides of his current cycle. Now this felt right. &quot;RAAHHHHHHHH!!!&quot; He let out a deep, baritone yell that could have shook everything in the gym. &quot;Now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talkin about!&quot; His eyes peered out from under his now simian brow to his three benefactors. He gave them an alpha smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he likes flexin&#39; all that juiced muscle.  We oughtta call him Flex&quot;, Thomas was unconsciously licking his lips watching the display in front of him. His tiny dick expanding. <br />
<br />
Blake switched to a side tricep pose. Having trouble positioning his arms around his sheer mass, he turned and found himself facing a slack jawed Sean frozen with his cup at his lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Blake?!?!  Blake???? Is that you? What. The. Fuck?!?!&quot;</p>
