<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendra had a big secret that she kept from everyone, she turned into a walking penis. This was a secret not only from her, but from her entire family. Apart from her family, only one person knew her secret, her best friend, Emily, and that&#39;s because she disobeyed her parents.<br />
<br />
***Flashback***<br />
<br />
As Kendra&#39;s 18th birthday approached, her parents gave her a handmade bracelet with strange symbols just like the one her mother always wore.  She didn&#39;t like the present and left it behind, going to have fun with Emily even though they had forbidden her to go out. As the two walked together Kendra felt strange and, thinking she might throw up, she went to the bathroom and approached the toilet, Emily accompanying her for support.  It was at this point that it happened, in ten minutes the top half of her body had turned into a huge penis while her breasts were now a huge ballsack between her legs. Aside from its size and the fact that it had the bottom half of a female body attached at its base, it differed the cock she became from a normal cock was that she still had eyes and was able to speak through her urethra.<br />
<br />
Emily was also scared by her transformation, but she didn&#39;t abandon her and even managed to take her back to her house without attracting too much attention, because the place wasn&#39;t very far from her house and she took her father&#39;s car without permission to help the friend.<br />
<br />
When they arrived at Kendra&#39;s house, her mother answered the door and when Emily told her what had happened, Kendra&#39;s mother tensed up and ran to the car, where she saw her walking dick daughter lying in the backseat so that others didn&#39;t see it.<br />
<br />
Kendra&#39;s mother called her husband and opened their garage door, taking her own car out while Kendra&#39;s father put Emily&#39;s family car inside, where after they closed the door they helped Kendra out and sent her to the living room.<br />
<br />
Inside the house, Kendra&#39;s parents explained the story of a woman approximately 1300 years before who fell in love with a man, but that another woman already liked this man.  Then they said the other woman was a witch and, in a fit of jealousy, he cursed this woman by turning her into a walking penis. Even with the curse, the man chose to stay with her instead of the witch and, with the help of an acquaintance who had knowledge in witchcraft, they managed to create an amulet (showing the bracelet she always wore) that could neutralize the curse and make her return to human form, but which should be used continuously, otherwise it would go back to being a walking penis.  Upon learning of this, the witch cast a new spell that made the curse hereditary and thus, all her female descendants would also have the same curse and that this would manifest itself when they turned 18. <br />
<br />
Kendra said she wasn&#39;t wearing the bracelet because she thought it was tacky, realizing her mistake in ignoring her parents&#39; request and that if she had, she wouldn&#39;t have turned into a freak. She then ran to her room, where she opened the door as she could with her lack of arms, and lay down on her bed in embarrassment. She didn&#39;t know how long she was brooding until her bedroom door opened and a walking cock, who was her mother, came in and sat on the bed next to her.<br />
<br />
Kendra&#39;s mother said that she took off her bracelet and let herself be transformed into a walking cock, just to try to make her more comfortable while they talked. She apologized for never telling about the family curse before, saying that even though she had already accepted her condition, she still couldn&#39;t work up the courage to bring it up with those who didn&#39;t know about it, so she just gave her the bracelet as a gift without explaining its function. She then explained to Kendra that the bracelet didn&#39;t need to be worn all the time to prevent her from transforming, as its power radiated and, as long as it was within two meters of her, she would be safe, but if she has already turned into a walking dick just, only with direct contact with her skin she would change back to normal.<br />
<br />
Kendra asked about her father and Emily, who saw everything and knew the family secret now.  Then her mother explained that she and her husband had spoken to their daughter&#39;s friend and she had promised to keep the secret before her father took her away.  She was also informed that her father already knew and that there was a very important detail that she should know. The bracelet protected her from transforming into a walking dick while she wore it and she would transform if she stayed away from it for a time that varied between two and three hours, but the power of the curse increased if she was sexually stimulated and she was going to transform immediately, even if she was wearing the bracelet.<br />
<br />
Her mother said that because of that, if she got any boyfriend, she should tell her secret before surprising them. She used herself as an example by saying that her father was the fourth suitor she gave herself to, but the first one who accepted her after learning about her curse. Telling how, even accepting it, he showed some discomfort the first few times he saw her transformed, but then he got used to it and no longer sees it as a problem. <br />
<br />
At the end of the conversation Kendra felt calmer, and shortly after her father entered her room taking her mother&#39;s bracelet and putting it on her leg, then he took Kendra&#39;s bracelet, which had been in the wardrobe drawer her, and put it on her daughter&#39;s leg. Kendra then sat next to her mother as the two slowly returned to normal over the next few minutes, and when her arms finished growing and hands forming back, she hugged her mother.<br />
<br />
***end of flashback***<br />
<br />
Months had passed and Kendra had gotten used to her condition.  She now only took the bracelet off to take a shower, as the material was sensitive to water, and immediately after the shower she would lie down to sleep, leaving it next to her pillow, and putting it on as soon as she woke up. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Kendra, this morning she overslept and left in a hurry, forgetting her bracelet.  Now she&#39;s already at school in the middle of class and...</p>
