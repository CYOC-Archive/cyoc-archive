<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About a week later, Barb fully transformed into a Dartmoor Mare and was shipped to England. She walked around the empty pasture in annoyance and confusion.  Her mind was filled with questions.  Why am I here? What happened to Justin? Who Daniel? Why do I feel so alone and lost? She made sure to avoid the other ponies in an attempt to keep her loyalty to her husband, Justin.  She didn&#39;t want to be mated with any of them, especially Daniel!<br />
<br />
Barb kept her human manners as she tried keeping up with past learned hygiene. She was placed in her stall and tried all night to hold her stool and urine. Finally, she couldn&#39;t hold it anymore and she pissed all over her stall floor. The next morning she woke up still feeling weak and sick from her ordeal. Ms. Jane talked to Barb to explain how she should accept her new life as a mare.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not a human, Barb.  You&#39;re a mare now.  You have to remember, you were born to be a mare.  You have to accept this change in life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Jane continued, and told Barb that she was in denial and needed time to adjust. Barb seemed to listen and since then, urinates and defecates whenever and wherever she pleases.<br />
<br />
But sometimes, Barb will shy away from people if she needs to relieve herself. Still seems that she is still a bit personal about doing that sort of thing in public, still keeping her human morals, even though she lost her human form.<br />
<br />
Ms. Jane also told Barb that she should become more comfortable with the other stallions as her body adjusted to her new life as a mare. In the meantime, Barb was reunited with Justin.  She was happy to see him again, but the reunion was soured as Justin wasn&#39;t interested in her. He would rather mess around with the other mares, Annie, Lilly, and Marge.<br />
<br />
Daniel noticed how upset Barb was when she saw Justin flirting with the other mares and decided to help her. Daniel approached Barb. Instincts kicked in and Daniel pranced about doing and acting like any stallion. His cock became massive and erect even as he pranced about Barb. Daniel&#39;s tail swished about his stallion&#39;s rear. Daniel&#39;s eyes sparkled with lustful excitement.<br />
<br />
In a surge of perverted pettyness, Barb&#39;s desire was to see, lick and lip nibble at Daniel&#39;s male organ. Daniel was surprised, but he was also aroused. He watched as Barb licked Daniel&#39;s penis and balls. Daniel was shocked at how much Barb enjoyed his manhood. He felt a tingle of pleasure run through him. He had never experienced such an intense pleasure before.<br />
<br />
Daniel&#39;s cock grew larger and harder. Daniel was surprised, but he was also excited to have a mare enjoy his manhood. Annie, Justin, Lilly, and Marge watched Daniel and Judy with interest.<br />
<br />
Barb began to suck on Daniel&#39;s manhood. She was sucking it hard and fast. She was eager to please him. She wanted to give her new mate the pleasure he deserved. Daniel was shocked at the sudden turn of events. He didn&#39;t know what to think. He had never had a mare suck him off like this before. He had always fantasized about it, but never thought it could happen.<br />
<br />
Barb sucked Daniel&#39;s cock like a pro. She was enjoying every minute of it. She was happy to have someone, even if it was only for this one moment. She wanted to make him feel good. She wanted to give him the pleasure he deserves. She wanted to be the best mate she could be.<br />
<br />
Daniel cornered Barb and she was mounted, becoming submissive. The soft and slow entry of the stallion into the mare was something to behold. Daniell was so sweet to Barb and took her feelings as a consideration.  Daniel knew exactly what he was doing and was able to make her feel so much better than she ever had before.<br />
<br />
Daniel stayed locked in Barb&#39;s vulva for twenty minutes and toyed with his maleness. This pleasured them both and seemed to cause the new mare to accept her life here at the farm. They mated more than a dozen times during that afternoon. Each mounting was as the others and Daniel thrusted inside Barb with smooth and easy moves.<br />
<br />
Barb was so satisfied and pleased with the way things turned out between her and Daniel. She was glad that Justin was not there to ruin it. She was glad that Daniel was there to show her the true meaning of love and passion.<br />
<br />
The next day, Barb went back to being herself, but she was happier knowing that she found the perfect stallion who truly understood her. She was glad that she was able to find happiness with Daniel. She was glad that she was able to find love with him. Barb and Daniel were inseparable after that day. They spend all their time together and love each other deeply, they are very happy.</p>
