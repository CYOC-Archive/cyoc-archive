<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drying off was an odd sensation as you rolled in the sand. As you did so, the water was rubbed off by the grains of sand and you could feel the sand sticking to you as you rolled in it. It created a sort of itching sensation in your tail as it began to pull in half into human legs and your tail fins shortening and turning back into human feet. Unfortunately when the itching feeling of transformation faded away, you found that you were still very much female. The weight of your breasts on your chest was very much still there, and there were clumps of damp sand all over you. You quickly began brushing it off, but despite this, a part of you was still amazed by all this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing,&quot; you commented softly as you looked down at yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, our magic is amazing, Michelle,&quot; Elizabeth said with a friendly smile, &quot;It enables us to do a great many things humans only dream of doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Including killing people through sex?&quot; you questioned.<br />
<br />
Her smile faded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, but it's not like it's something that we particularly enjoy,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;It's how we feed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean people's energy is your food?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; Elizabeth nodded, &quot;if we could do it without draining someone, we would... but we can't. As mermaids... sirens... whatever name you wish to use, we must feed on the sexual energy of human males.&quot;<br />
<br />
You followed her away up the beach until she came to a spot that actually looked fairly sheltered from being seen by anyone else. Once at that spot, Elizabeth crouched down and began trying to roll a large looking rock away. To your surprise it moved easily, revealing a large wooden chest. It looked like some pirate's treasure chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven't you ever tried eating normal foods... like, you know... fish?&quot; you asked her. The notion of being stuck as some creature that fed off of people's energy didn't sit well with you. The notion of being female didn't fit with you either, but the fear of death kept you going along with Florencia's deal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some do... but even they need to feed on sexual energy,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;It's not like it's a complete alternative for mermaids. Besides, even if it was, humans already over fish the oceans of their fish. The calculate the minimum that whales, sharks, sea turtles, other marine mammals and squids and so forth, and then you fish everything you can until you bring the fish populations down to that minimum requirement. And by doing this every year... the world's oceans are running OUT of fish. If you don't stop, the oceans will become one massive watery desert. If we ate fish, we'd only speed up the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were quiet on that. You enjoyed fishing, but for you that was sport fishing. You didn't know much about commercial fishing companies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever fed on people?&quot; you asked her nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Elizabeth answered, also sounding nervous, &quot;I am a mature mermaid. I need that stimulation to feed and survive. Just as you need it, and just as your wife will need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down as you crouched beside her. The D cup breasts with nipples you'd love to suck on if they were on someone else filling your view.<br />
<br />
&quot;But for the most part, that's why we've tended to stick to sailors and various elements humans tend to look down on anyway,&quot; Elizabeth clumsily tried to console you, &quot;Remove those who are thinking with one piece of their anatomy, and it isn't their brain.&quot;<br />
<br />
That didn't entirely work as she pulled out the chest and opened it. Inside was a collection of clothes for both men and women, which surprised you. Elizabeth noticed this and decided to change the subject of your conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is mostly things from men we've fed on... or like you we've sensed to be good at heart and transformed into mermaids or human women that have found us and asked to become mermaids,&quot; Elizabeth explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you accepted?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;we aren't heartless or evil. Good men we transform because we sense that they either want to join us or we feel they're worthy of joining us... and the women that have joined us have asked politely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the boy who named you?&quot; you wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;He never actually came in the water,&quot; Elizabeth sighed, &quot;we would have loved to transform him and love him as a sister forever, but he never came into the water. That's how our transformation magic works. You'll need to get your wife INTO the water before you can transform her.&quot;<br />
<br />
You only sighed as you began to go through the trunk with Elizabeth. You found an extra large tee shirt and a pair of men's sweat pants. You began trying them on to find that the pants just barely fit and the shirt was actually a little big. Elizabeth had meanwhile put on a bikini top and a skirt that had been in there. The skirt fit her, but the bikini top looked like it was only just covering her breasts. It was apparently the largest top that she preferred as once she had it on, the trunk was shut and pushed back into the cave.<br />
<br />
You glanced out to the see to see that the other mermaids had either dove beneath the surface of the ocean or had moved further out to sea. Remembering how Elizabeth had spoken to Florencia about the potential of feeding on you if you failed you were seized with a new question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you really feed on me... you know... if I refused or couldn't get my wife here by tomorrow?&quot; you asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would because I have to,&quot; Elizabeth admitted as she rolled the rock back into place to hide the the trunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you don't want to?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don't,&quot; Elizabeth nodded, &quot;you're so pretty. We could feel that you were worthy of our gifts... and there is something in you that I can feel as love... as our kind loves between sisters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if not related by blood...&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth nodded, &quot;Yes. And so, I do not want to lose you as a sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not let me go?&quot; you ask, &quot;I promise I won't expose you or the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'd be nice, but I can't,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;Florencia wouldn't approve... and... and... I'd be heartbroken if you left us. I love you, Michelle. I don't know why, but I do. So... please... stay with us... bring your wife to join us... be my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
You found you couldn't help but sympathize with Elizabeth in a way. And despite your wish to become a permanent male human again, you hugged her to you. She smiled and hugged you back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try,&quot; you said weakly.<br />
<br />
As the two of you hugged, you could feel your breasts push against her breasts. Even through the fabric of the shirt you had on and the fabric of the swim-wear that Elizabeth had put on, you tell she was slightly aroused and strangely you could feel your own body becoming aroused. This arousal though wasn't merely a desire to have sex. It almost felt like hunger...</p>
