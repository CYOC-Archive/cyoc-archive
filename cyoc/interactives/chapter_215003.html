<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dawn reached home shortly before the sun went down, which didn’t mean much as the weather was getting slightly colder as the season changed. She walked up to the dining room table to see a note left by her mom. <br />
<br />
“Dinner is in the fridge, warm it up for you and your brother. Me and your father have to work late at the lab, backlogged again.” The note read.  <br />
<br />
Dawn could hear her brother playing in his room, his TV being loud. She walked to his door down the hallway and opened it. She sees him playing on his computer, wearing just a par of basketball shorts and his briefs underneath.  <br />
<br />
“Hey, why don’t you shower after the next round on that thing. I will warm up dinner while you shower.” Dawn says to her distracted brother. He kept on playing, not hearing her, so she walks over and flicks his ear with her finger. <br />
<br />
“Ow. Sis, what was that for.” Joseph says as he rubs his ear. <br />
<br />
“When you are finished with the next round, take a shower. I will throw the food in the oven for dinner. Oh, and before you hop in, see me. I was giving a sample of personal cleaner, but it was meant for guys. I got two, so you and Kevin can both try it.” Dawn says before walking out of her brother’s room. Behind her, she could hear him complaining about having to take a shower on a Friday night. <br />
<br />
Dawn goes to her room and takes the ointment out of her bag. It was definitely to large to be considered an “trial” size, but she had a way around that. She grabs some gloves from her makeup drawer so she wouldn’t get any of the ointment on herself. She saw the warning of it women into man, and she was not ready or willing for that. She then grabs empty lip gloss container she kept and fills it with the ointment. She had just enough time to clean up the container and toss the gloves as her brother knocks on her door. <br />
<br />
She opens it to see her 13 year old brother already in his towel, tapping his foot on the ground and holding his phone in his hands. Dawn really hoped that this ointment would work for her brother. He was only about 4 foot 10 inch, shorter than most of his friends. He still had some baby fat on him, as his abs didn’t show. It wasn’t like he wasn’t an athletic kid. He was a good basketball and baseball player, good runner. Puberty just seemed to skip him, but looking at their dad, that wasn’t surprising. Dawn truly believes that if her brother had some more muscle on him to add to his naturally tan skin, he probably be dating already, if not the first year of high school next year. She even had a few girls in mind for him when he started, since she was going to be a senior the next year. <br />
<br />
“So, what did you get me.” Joseph asks grumpily. <br />
<br />
“I was giving an ointment that is supposed to be put on before you shower. You put it on your private area, wait five minutes and then hop in the shower. It is supposed to keep the smell down and protect from sweat.” Dawn explains as she hands over the ointment in the small container. <br />
<br />
“I don’t stink down there. Besides, how would you know, are you sniffing my junk.” Joseph complains before turning to head to the bathroom in the hallway. <br />
<br />
“Something on you is smelling like a gym class. Just use it and wash off. I will go start dinner.” Dawn says as she gives her brother a little push into the bathroom. Joseph mumbles under his breath as he closes the door. He walks over to the sink and takes off his towel to place it and his phone on the sink. He then looks down at himself before doing anything else. <br />
<br />
His “Junk” wasn’t much to look at, in his mind. He was only two inches long, shorter than most of the others in his gym class, and he had no hair down there yet. He barely had any under his arms. One of his friends joked that he should just shave the few hairs he had so he could look smother. <br />
<br />
Joseph sets a 5 minute timer on his phone before opening the ointment and applying it on to himself. He felt like he was trying to masturbate, as the ointment was creamy. He rubbed it in all over his crotch, penis and balls, making sure to reach every area. Ad he finishes, he turns on the shower to wash off his hand. <br />
<br />
“I guess I wait now.” He whispers as he watches the timer count down. The five minutes seemed to take forever, but with the house’s old pipping, that gave the shower time to warm up. As his phone goes off, Joseph hits the off button and looks at his boyish figure one more time in the mirror before stepping into the shower to begin his bathing. <br />
<br />
He went on about his shower normally, lathering up his body before washing his short hair. As he rubs his soap over his groin, he felt a warming sensation come over it. “I better not get burned by the crap.” he says as he is quick to scrub off the warming parts of his body. The feeling seemed to go away as he cleaned, but the ointment had already started to take effect.<br />
<br />
 As Joseph starts to lather up his chest, his penis was already showing signs of change. His arms blocked the view of his penis slowly lengthening and thickening. The two inches soon became three and the four, as his balls also grew between his legs. His penis now dangled between his legs, and his balls were barely visible from behind. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t until Joseph started to wash his hair and turn away from the shower head that he even noticed the change. As he turns, his now longer penis swings around hind hits his thigh with an audible “smack”. Joseph looks down to see what hit him, to find that his new growth. <br />
<br />
“What the…?” Joseph says as he reaches for his new penis, holding it in his hand. As he holds it, his penis starts to twitch as more growth comes. Joseph moans as another warmth hits the area, and his penis starts to stretch out further. He can now feel his balls growing too, as they start to press against his legs. <br />
<br />
His penis stretches and thickens more, going to five inches, then six, and then seven. As it reached 8 inches, Joseph found himself wishing that it would stop growing, as it was now longer then his two hands together. His balls themselves were now obvious from behind. <br />
<br />
His wish was answered as the penis did seem to stop at 8 inches. Joseph inspects his new cock in his hands, realizing that he was still soft. His fingers barely could reach around his cock as it was just to round. What really surprised him was the weight it seemed to have as he let go of it to see how far down it now went, which it lands past halfway to his knees. <br />
<br />
Then Joseph started to get a familiar feeling in his groin, as blood started to rush to his cock. He turned to face the showerhead once again, trying to hold himself up against the wall as his member starts to grow erect. As it does, the cock starts stretching out again, as veins starts appearing under his skin. He feels lick he is being inflated like a balloon as rises up and stretches out to a new ten inches hard. Joseph moans as his hips instinctively start to thrust forward. <br />
<br />
As he is thrusting, the rest of his body starts to change. His baby fat starts to melt away as his muscles grow some definition. He grows taller, an inch for every few thrusts until he is now four inches taller than before, 5 feet 2 inches total. No new hair grows in over his body, but his skin smoothens over his new muscles. <br />
<br />
Joseph soon squints his eyes as his hips push forward one last time, his balls churning, and cock head widens one last time. A load of fresh seed comes from the boy, as his growth slows to a stop. The load hits the back of the shower, under the showerhead and drips to the drain as Joseph twitches as more waves hit him, firing seed out like a hose for his improved cock. As the last of his cum is ejected, and is now just sliding down his monster rod, Joseph catches his breath. <br />
<br />
A million thoughts went through his mind as his member slowly returned to its soft 8 inches. What could have caused this? How big was he? Was it over? His heart raced as the shower water rushed over him. <br />
<br />
Then a knock came from the door. “You going to spend all night in there? Dinner will be ready soon.” It was Dawn. <br />
“Be out in a minute…” Joseph says, his voice a little shaky. It didn’t change at all, so he thought he must not have aged up. Then what caused his change? <br />
<br />
Joseph turns off the shower and steps out. Before grabbing his towel, he wipes off the mirror so he can see himself. Joseph looks on at the mirror to find that not only has he grown, but he also now had a body of an athletic teen. A teen whose cock was now his distinguishing feature.</p>
