<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To say it had been chaos leaving Circes amusement park would be an understatement. Kellie and her friends had barely avoided the Kitsune as they descended on the park, taking their payment for Liliths peace. The teens had watched as one by one the Kitsune had pounced upon the anthro’s within the park, useing the same magic they had used on Kellie. Kellie couldn’t help but silver in fright as she watched each and every anthro transform and regress into kits before her very eyes. <br />
<br />
After fleeing the park and making their way safely back to Merlin’s home the teens tried to catch their breath as they now tried to grapple with a new set of problems. Kumiko, Mary Elise and Claudia were still anthro animals. The spells that had transformed them had not abated leaving the group worried. Couple that with Mika being kidnapped and they were truely at a loss. Kellie now found herself rifling through her fathers cabinets in search of alcohol.<br />
<br />
“What are we going to do,” Mary asked as she gazed worriedly at Kellie. Kellie frowned, Turning from her search as she gazed at the anthro owl in front of her. “Your the one with the Ring of Transformation,” she grumbled. “Use it to change back.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you think I’ve been trying,” Mary Elise exclaimed. “I can’t seem to get it to work right. Can’t you or your dad help?”<br />
<br />
“In a minute,” Kellie grumbled, returning to her search. Mary Elise narrowed her large owl eyes as she angrily glared at Kellie. As she was about to say something the honey haired teen gacpve a triumphant sigh. Emerging from the cabinet with a bottle of scotch the teen hurriedly pulled off the top before taking a massive swing of liquor. “Ugh I needed that,” she grimaced, wiping her mouth.<br />
<br />
“You can get drink later Damn it,” Kumiko bellowed. “We have to fix this and get my sister back.”<br />
<br />
“Still trying to figure that out,” Kellie replied. “Although if you guys had listened to me in the first place we wouldn’t have to worry about changing you back.”<br />
<br />
“So your saying this is our fault,” Claudia roared. “What the hell Kellie that’s not fair.”<br />
<br />
“Girls listen,” Katie said quickly, trying to prevent everyone from coming to blows. “Fighting amongst ourselves isn’t going to change anything. We need to figure this out and soon before we lose Mika.” The teens quieted down, mumbling an apology to one another before falling into an eerie silence. <br />
<br />
“Look I’m sorry,” Kellie sighed. “I shouldn’t have gone off okay. I...I just as worried as you. I don’t want to lose Mika either but I need to think. I wasn’t expecting Lilith to go psycho bitch on Circe.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think any of us saw that coming,” Karen said meekly. “I mean wasn’t that her friend?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t think Lilith has friends,” Lisa huffed. “She has minions and anyone that seems to threaten her gets dealt with. It’s scary and a little sad.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think that’s why they haven’t changed back yet,” Samantha asked as she gestured towards her transformed friends. Kellie could only nod, it made sense. If Circe was now gone from the timeline than it seemed plausible. Circes magic had transformed the girls but if Circe wasn’t around to invoke the counter charm would it mean they were stuck like this? Sighing in frustration Kellie knew what she needed to do. Picking up her cellphone she began to dial a number.<br />
<br />
“Who are you calling,” Katie asked.<br />
<br />
“Jack,” Kellie sighed. “Circe was his aunt so chances are she taught him everything that he knows. He might know a counter spell to this.”<br />
<br />
“Can we trust him though,” Lisa asked. “I doubt it,” Kellie responded. “But our options are kind of limited. He might be the only one that could help.” <br />
<br />
A brief conversation with Jack eventually led to him arriving at Kellies doorstep with Sebastian in tow. As Kellie opened her front door she frowned at the boy and his friend, she really didn’t want to ask for his help. “Thanks for coming,” she grumbled.<br />
<br />
“You don’t seem very excited to see me,” Jack smirked. Kellie could only roll her eyes as she grabbed her former lover by the arm and dragged him inside. “Quit being a dick and get in here,” she groaned. “I need your help.” Jack stumbled, almost falling as Kellie slammed the door behind him. Regaining his composure the teen looked first at Kellie before turning to look at Kellies friends. Jack now stifled a laugh as he gazed at the anthro girls. “Nice look,” he chuckled, causing Kellie to elbow him in the ribs.<br />
<br />
“Don’t need your bullshit right now Jack,” she said curtly. “Your aunt and your mom did a number on my friends. I need your help in changing them back. Plus, some other things.”<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you ask my mom and Aunt Circe,” Jack replied. <br />
<br />
“Would love to except your mom kicked Circe out the timeline after going psycho bitch on her,” Kellie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Jacks jaw dropped as he took in this information. “Aunt Circe is gone,” he whispered. “That’s impossible, how could that happen? She’s a goddess and one of my moms most trusted allies. Why would she kick Circe out? That makes no sense.”<br />
<br />
“Jealousy,” Katie huffed. “Your mom was jealous that Circe was not only making her own kingdom but making peace with us. She felt threatened so she sent her to her own timeline. Now our friends are stuck like this and the Kitsune have kidnapped Mika.”<br />
<br />
Jack braced himself against the wall as he tried to turn this information over in his head. He was well aware of his mother’s temper and knew she was quick to anger, sometimes irrationally. To kick Circe out of the timeline though was something he just couldn’t wrap his mind around. “So can you help us or what,” Mary Elise snorted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jack stammered, trying to clear his head. “Yeah it shouldn’t be a problem.” Taking a deep breath he now looked at Kellies friends. “Dude What are you doing,” Sebastian asked. Jack turned towards his friend observing a surprised look on his face. “Look,” he said. “Me and Kellie kind of came to an understanding. We wouldn’t let anything happen to eachothers friends.”<br />
<br />
“So were going to help them,” Sebastian exclaimed. “What’s your mom going to say? We’re supposed to be taking them down not building them up.”<br />
<br />
“My mom isn’t being very rational right now Sebastian,” Jack stated. “Taking my aunt out just doesn’t sit well with me. To keep the balance we gotta help.” Sebastian frowned, crossing her arms across his chest as he unhappily gazed at his friend. Jack now turned once more to face the girls. Circe had taught him quite a bit about anthro transformations but he was a novice when compared to Circe. Taking a deep breath he now tried to focus on reverting them back to human form.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise, Claudia, and Kumiko shivered as they felt the changes begin to overtake their bodies. Glancing at themselves they could see their forms begin to lessen. They were slowly shrinking down to human sized proportions, their fur and feathers gradually lessening. A sigh of relief came from the three girls as they noticed their faces changing back to what they were so accustomed to. Mary Elise beak slowly withdrew back into her face, her head getting smaller while her neck began to take shape once more. Claudia and Kumiko smiled as their muzzles grew smaller, their tails retracting once more into their bodies.<br />
<br />
“It’s working,” Claudia exclaimed, as she shrank back into human form. “Um it’s really working,”Kumiko blushed. “But um...we didn’t  have any clothes on, remember.”<br />
<br />
The three teens looked at their bodies before gasping in embarrassment. The original transformation had left the three of them naked anthros. As the changes began to subside they noticed that as their human features returned, their clothes didn’t. Kumiko, Mary, and Claudia first noticed when their feet and legs began to look more human. The feathers and fur vanished leaving the girls barefoot in the middle of Kellies living room. Gasping they could see the fur and feathers that adorned their bodies gradually lessening, exposing more and more of their nude bodies.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit give me a blanket or something,” Mary Elise exclaimed. Claudia ducked down behind the far end of the couch as her transformation continued while Kumiko tore a painting off the wall, useing it to shield her body. As Jack completed reversing his transformation, he gawked at the three embarrassed teenage girls hiding their nude bodies. “Why the hell are you naked,” he exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“It was part of the spell,” Mary Elise moaned. “Now stop staring okay. This is embarrassing enough as is.”<br />
<br />
Jack and Sebastian blushed, turning their backs as they meekly apologized. “Thanks Jack,”Kellie sighed. “I really appreciate that.”<br />
<br />
“Really,” he said confidently. “How much do you appreciate it?”<br />
<br />
Kellie groaned, pushing Jack into a wall. “Will you stop being such a pig already I told you I’m gay.”<br />
<br />
“”Fine,” Jack huffed. “So I changed your friends back your welcome. Anything else?”<br />
<br />
Kellie blushed, averting her eyes as she now felt herself swallowing her pride. Whether she liked it or not she was going to need Jack and Sebastian’s help if they were going to help Mika. “Yeah Jack,” she said meekly. “I really need your help saving Mika. Please.”<br />
<br />
Jack paused as he stared at Kellie. Despite the girls negative opinion of him, he was the first she thought of to ask for help. Maybe he was following himself, maybe it was unrequited love, but something about Kellie made him want to help her. “I must be out of my mind,” he thought. “She hates me and all I want to do is please her. Ugh love sucks sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“Okay Kellie,” he sighed. “I’ll help. Now what’s the plan?” Kellie breathed a sigh of relief, hugging Jack tightly. With his help hopefully they could save Mika from a lifetime as a Kitsune.</p>
