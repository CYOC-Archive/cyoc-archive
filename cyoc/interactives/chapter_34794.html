<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter was now incredibly massive.  Every inch of him reeked of power and oozed rock hard muscle.  Joce couldn't get enough of her even LARGER boyfriend.  &quot;Wow, I never thought anyone could get THIS big!&quot; Peter said , looking himself over.  His clothes were now much to small for him, due to the rapid growth spurt that just took place.  His t-shirt had ridden up from his rock-hard 44-inch waist, to nearly the middle of his eight-pack abs.  The sleeves had torn already from his gargantuan biceps and it was stretched to the limit across his inhumanly wide back and thick lats, and incredibly huge pecs.  His jeans were near bursting from his mammoth quads and had ridden up his calves nearly to his knees.<br />
<br />
As Peter bent over to see his feet from over his titanic chest, his clothes couldn't take the strain, and burst off him with a big &quot;POP!&quot;<br />
&quot;Whoops!  Guess I didn't realize just how big I was!&quot; Peter said, standing up straight, now dressed in nothing but his ultra-tight boxers.  &quot;That's alright, honey, it was sexy how you burst out of your clothes!&quot; Joce said, licking her lips.  She loved it when he grew so large that he burst from his clothes.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, they both heard an incredibly loud rumbling sound.  Peter groaned, clutching his stomach, &quot;Ohhh, that last growth spurt made me REALLY hungry!&quot;  Joce, glancing over Peter's gargantuan bare shoulder, noticed an advertisement for a World Food Festival happening that day, at that time.  &quot;I've got just the thing for you, Pete!&quot; Joce said, pointing to the sign, &quot;There's GOT to be enough food at a FOOD FAIR to satisfy your hunger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets hope so!&quot; Peter said, clutching his rock hard abs in pain from the intense hunger.  &quot;But before we go, do ya think you could get me some clothes?&quot;  Joce, grinned, &quot;of course!&quot; she said, and in an instant, Peter was wearing a pair of blue jeans, a white undershirt and a nice green button-up shirt buttoned half way up.  &quot;have to look nice for the festival!&quot; Joce said, already dressed in a nice form-fitting knee-length green dress that complemented Peter's shirt.  &quot;Lets go!&quot;<br />
<br />
The picture-perfect pair walked to the festival, which was only a couple miles away, arriving, they were already getting stares from everyone there.  By now, Peter's hunger was nearly bringing him to his knees, and quickly pulled Joce over to the first stand, a burger stand, and ordered three of everything off the menu. &quot;How much?&quot; Joce asked.  &quot;Uh...uh...uh...free!  It's on the house!&quot; the man behind the counter said.  &quot;Wow, thanks!&quot; Peter said, taking the bags, and digging into them before they had even walked away.<br />
<br />
Peter finished every crumb of the food in the bags in 10 minutes flat, already the waist of his jeans was feeling a bit snug, but he thought nothing of it, he was not even close to being satisfied.<br />
<br />
Peter and Joce proceeded to stop at every single stand at the festival and ordering huge amounts of food, paying for none of it, since every single vender wanted their food to be seen being eaten by such a massive muscle-man.  But Peter was slowly becoming more than just a great wall of muscle.  His clothes continually got tighter and tighter.  By the third stand, Peter had undone the button of his jeans and by the fourth the zipper had crept down on its own.  He was having trouble moving in his tightening jeans, and his already massive quads were growing so large from the excess weight being added to them, he was forced to waddle.  By the sixth stand, the first button popped open on Peter's shirt, quickly followed by the rest, his growing belly had grown much to large to be contained by them.  The bottom of the massive sphere sticking out in front of Peter had started to poke out the bottom of Peter's white undershirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm just now starting to feel a little full, but I still feel kinda hungry!&quot; Peter said, rubbing his oven-sized belly while sitting on a straining and bending bench.  &quot;Well then, how 'bout desert?!&quot; Joce asked.  &quot;That actually sounds really good!&quot; Peter said, &quot;thats why I love you so much.  You always know exactly what I need!&quot;  Well, hon, you just wait here, and I'll be right back with desert! Joce said, and walked away in search of a desert stall.<br />
<br />
While Peter was sitting there, he was getting nonstop stare from every passerby.  One little girl even approached him to ask in a sweet, timid voice, &quot;are you Santa?&quot;  Peter chuckled, his massive gut bobbing up and down, and said, &quot;Sorry no, but i do see the resemblance!&quot; rubbing the top of his gargantuan stomach.<br />
<br />
Joce returned with four venders all carrying huge trays piled with ice creams, bars, brownies, cakes, and every other kind of desert you can imagine.  Instantly, Peter began to wolf down every morsel of the stuff.  Continuing his immense growth spurt.  His stomach pushed out even further and wider.  His jeans began to rip down the sides, as did his shirt, while riding up the massive orb that was his gut.  Peter was forced to lean further and further back on the bench to make room for his swelling belly.  By the time he finished, Peter could not see past the titanic stomach.  It almost looked as though Peter had swallowed a refrigerator, only it was round and much wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready to go, sweetie?&quot; Peter asked Joce looking to his right and seeing the tiny girl sitting beside him.  &quot;only if you are!&quot; Joce replied.  &quot;Well lets go then!&quot; Peter said.  But when Peter tried to stand, he found he couldn't move.  His gut had grown so large and so heavy, that his feet couldn't support his own weight!<br />
&quot;aaargh! I can't move!&quot; Peter moaned.  Peter's gut was so large that it hung down between his legs, and touched the ground, so that he couldn't even get to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what are we gonna do?!&quot; Peter asked.</p>
