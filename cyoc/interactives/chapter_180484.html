<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Krissi knew that she needed to do the smart thing and not phone Dustin&#39;s dad. She also knew that there was no way a doctor or an ambulance was going to help either. She had no idea what to do. She stared at her phone in panic for a moment before being pulled back to reality by a crackling noise.<br />
<br />
She gasped and stared over at mosquito Dustin, who was now standing to his full height, about as tall as Krissi&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
In fresh horror, the teen realized that moments ago he had been as tall as a man. Now he was much shorter. She watched him for a moment and realization set in. Another strange crunching noise, and this time Krissi watched with morbid fascination as Dustin the giant mosquito compressed. He was shrinking!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, D, what&#39;s happening to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mosquito Dustin looked absolutely pathetic. Even without any discernable facial expression his constant trembling and defeated body language conveyed his sadness and fear. Even his wings hung drooping.<br />
<br />
Even though he was a cruel bastard like his father, and now he had suddenly been turned into a monstrous insect, Krissi couldn&#39;t help but want to comfort him. She dropped her phone, stepped forward, and grabbed Dustin around his slim upper body, held him close, and went wide eyed as he shrank against her, his hairy head rustling down her chest and toward her belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin, my God, I think you&#39;re... you&#39;re...&quot;<br />
<br />
With an even more pathetic posture, the giant mosquito nodded and looked up at Krissi with death looming over him. He was becoming a full bug now, wasn&#39;t he?<br />
<br />
A lifetime of being a huge bully and pompous man&#39;s man. Dustin slumped as Krissi knelt down in front of him, still holding him as he felt another spasm of shrinkage coming.<br />
<br />
He fell below her waist and let out a long mournful whimper from his long trunk like proboscis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, honey! No!&quot; Krissi teared up, gulping. She reached for poor Dustin and easily picked him up off the floor. He was so light! She held he giant insect to her chest and put him over her shoulder. She felt him pulsate and writhe, shrinking down further. He was getting small! Krissi looked at her former boyfriend and saw his tense and terrified body language. He couldn&#39;t stop shaking. Krissi turned to the basement couch again, pulled the blanket off the back, and sat down with Dustin. She turned him onto his winged back, wrapped him up in the blanket for comfort, and cradled him in her arms.<br />
<br />
The mosquito seemed to stop trembling somewhat. He stared up at his girlfriend lifelessly, completely unable to communicate or emote in any meaningful way.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God.&quot; Krissi gasped, choking back tears. &quot;You... you don&#39;t deserve this. I know you... I always knew it was because of your dad. I... I always loved you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mosquito softened somewhat, and pulled one of his long front legs out of the blanket, he reached for Krissi and she gave him her hand, holding onto his delicate clawed digits.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Dustin threw himself against Krissi&#39;s arm and began to shake again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Krissi pleaded.<br />
<br />
Dustin began to crunch and audibly stretch. He flailed suddenly as he explosively grew in size, throwing the blanket away and swelling forward in Krissi&#39;s lap. She gasped and held him close to her, as Dustin first reached his former size, legs flailing and body writhing, and exceeded it. Soon he was as big as the couch!<br />
<br />
Krissi stared in shock at the mass of giant insect in front of her. Dustin fell to his side in front of the TV, sliding off Krissi&#39;s legs, got to his feet, and seemed to look himself over. He flexed his wings for the first time, making a whoosh in the air as they drifted away from his torso and snapped back against his abdomen. He turned to Krissi and gave her a shrug with his front legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Krissi said simply, staring in awe. &quot;You got... you got big.&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, Dustin snapped to attention again, letting out a huff from his spiracles and starting to stretch again. He visibly strained, head down, big bug ass up in the air, as he grew even larger. Trembling, stretching out, he knocked the TV onto the floor, shattering it with a thud, and his bulk pressed the stand over. Krissi cried out and bolted off the couch as the giant sized mosquito pressed out and out, quickly filling the basement and breaking the only overhead light bulb. Now immense, a twenty foot long mosquito struggled to move, deciding that staying very still was in his best interest.<br />
<br />
Krissi raised up from behind the couch and met her boyfriend&#39;s gaze. Even without expression, she recognized the sheepish hunch of his front legs. <br />
<br />
Dustin was pressed into the roof supports. His antennae twitched madly, and he slowly bent his head from side to side, examining the unfinished basement that was now bathed in cool evening light.<br />
<br />
They had only moments to take stock of the situation before suddenly, unexpectedly, the bus sized mosquito jolted again. In alarm, Dustin flattened himself to the floor as much as he could, already changing again...</p>
