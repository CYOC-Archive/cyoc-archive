<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jade awoke to the sound of cows mooing. Morning tardiness left her ignorant for a few minutes. As she opened her eyes, she noticed her mouth and head shape was drastically different.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered.<br />
<br />
She shot her head up, looking around in her new environment. As she looked to her side, she could see Mark sitting on a chair, sleeping. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mark!&quot; Jade called out. <br />
<br />
Mark opened his eyes groggily for a few seconds. As soon as he saw that Jane was awake, he immediately got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jade!&quot; he exclaimed. He immediately got up and went down on his knees, hugging her head. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade, still very confused and terrified, was concerned of what had happened to her, and why they were inside the barn. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell happened to me!&quot; she yelled. &quot;Why do I feel, bigger?&quot; she continues, squirming on the hay cover that she&#39;d been covered on while sleeping. &quot;And what&#39;s this between my legs?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark hesitated. &quot;w-Well, it does seem like....&quot; He stammered. &quot;It&#39;s-uh.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few moments passed by without Mark saying a word.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jade asked. <br />
<br />
But still, Mark couldn&#39;t put it into words. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for Pete&#39;s sake!&quot; Jade yells. <br />
<br />
Mark looked at her with a somewhat worried expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot; Jade said again. <br />
<br />
And again, no answer. Jade was getting annoyed. <br />
<br />
She immediately tried to sit up, but felt heavy. She tried again, this time using her hands. As she got to all fours, she felt natural like that. Soon after, the cover fell off of her, revealing her new form. Jade looked behind her, then down at her belly. Then at her hands. She couldn&#39;t believe it.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!&quot; Jade screamed bloody murder. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK!?? AM I A COW?? HOW DID THIS HAPPEN TO ME??&quot; she shouted. <br />
<br />
Mark started to freak out too. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know!&quot; Mark said frantically. &quot;I just saw you clutching your stomach, then the next thing I know you&#39;re shifting and growing, and then you&#39;re a cow!&quot; Mark sat down.<br />
<br />
Jade tries to take a step back, but slips on her back hooves, and lands on her but. &quot;Ahhh, oww!&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
Her body didn&#39;t tolerate the fall very well. Her whole midsection started wobbling as her ass hurt from the impact. Her swollen udder gets impacted too, but not as hard. <br />
<br />
&quot;AH, son of a bitch!&quot; she yells. <br />
<br />
They both sat there in silence for a few moments, looking at each other with worried expressions on each of their faces.<br />
<br />
Mark looks at his wife, instead of seeing her gorgeous, smiling face, he sees that of a cow, which has a wig for some reason, that being Jade&#39;s real hair. <br />
<br />
Jade calms down, as she tries to settle-in on her new form. She would have to get used to not using her front limbs anymore. A lot of new sensations come to her. Her sense of smell was greatly amplified during her transformation into the animal she is now. Her stomach grumbled as it yearned food, a lot of it, since her new body needed it for nourishment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking great!&quot; Jane said. &quot;What salad would be this big for me to eat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade got up. She wobbled a bit, on the count that she was now on fours. She eventually got the hang of it though, and started pacing forward. &quot;I&#39;m going inside.&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
Mark looked up. &quot;I-I&#39;ll just come with you, I guess.&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better.&quot; Jade says sternly. <br />
<br />
Jade continued walking, with mark falling suit behind her. She was still getting used to the walking on all fours thing, but was still quite wobbly and clumsy. <br />
<br />
Mark made sure that he would catch Jade if she ever tripped, since he noticed her difficulty with her walking. <br />
<br />
More sensations came at her attention when she walked. The constant swaying of her udders was a new experience. She wagged her tail for the second time, too. She smelled the cold, morning air, as it helped calm her down with her situation.<br />
<br />
Finally, they got to the front door. <br />
<br />
Mark opened the door, as he held it like a gentlemen, motioning for Jade to come inside. The door was barely wide enough to fit Jade&#39;s huge stomach, only scraping it slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Mark asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine&quot; she replied. <br />
<br />
Mark gave Jade some space, as she was still getting used to being the size that she was. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re gonna have to renovate, according to my size at least.&quot; she suggests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll get into that now.&quot; he says. &quot;Hold on.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark goes into the walk-in closet and grabs as much blankets and pillows he can get. He goes to the living room and places the pillows and blankets on the couch for a second. Mark then grabbed the living room table and pushed it all the way to the wall near the windows. He was careful to not scrape the carpet. After that, he got the blankets and pillows, and put on the floor where the table once stood. <br />
<br />
Jade stared at him, confused at what he was doing, until she realized that she would be sleeping there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Mark, you didn&#39;t have to.&quot; Jade said<br />
<br />
But mark insisted. &quot;Well, would you rather sleep in the barn again?&quot; he chuckled.<br />
<br />
Jade smiled, as she trotted over to the couch and lied down by the blankets and pillows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Comfortable?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough&quot; Jade replied.<br />
<br />
They both smiled. Even though Jade seemed to be a huge, ordinary dairy cow, Mark could still see her bright, green eyes he&#39;s known and loved for years. <br />
<br />
Jade&#39;s smile faded away. She looked elsewhere, by the window to be specific. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I like this?&quot; she asks again. <br />
<br />
Mark returned to his state of concern for her well being.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Jade, I, I don&#39;t know&quot; he says. &quot;Really.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark put his hand on her neck, stroking it, trying to make her feel better<br />
<br />
Jade turned to him, and smiled. Mark smiled too. He continued stroking, as Jade moved her head to his palm to stroke her face. It was almost like petting a dog, except it&#39;s your own wife in that in the body of a cow. It was weird doing it, but Mark was just happy that Jane wasn&#39;t uncomfortable like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever happens, just know that I&#39;ll do anything for you.&quot; he says, with a calm, philosophical voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will?&quot; Jade asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will.&quot; Mark replies. &quot;I promise.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, can you do me a favor now?&quot; Jade asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah sure.&quot; he replies. &quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
