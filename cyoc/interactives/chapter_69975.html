<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Craig stopped for a second, unsure. While he hated to be late for class he considered the thought so... tempting. Arriving late, making the teacher mad at him while he didn't give a fuck. Fuck it was just for a while. Surely that couldn't be that bad. Why would he want to go to class so early, anyway?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine I'll stay just for a while.&quot; Craig said, with a false tone of annoyance that Sam caught and smiled to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitching!&quot; Sam replied happily. He sat down once again. Craig sat next to him, both with their backs against the wall.<br />
<br />
There was a quiet moment when both were trying to figure what to say but then Craig broke the silence with a question that was bugging him. &quot;So... how long do you smoke pot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam could only laugh and then rubbed Craig's hair a bit. &quot;Hey, watch it!&quot; Craig responded, a little annoyed. Sam stopped but he still laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck man, ever heard about discretion before? This shit isn't like smoking a fag, you know. Don't want to make it public, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I'm just kinda curious...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Curious? Shit, you must be begging for this shit. With all that being on time and sorry this, sorry that. I told you, you need to chill a bit. I could make you a favour, you know...&quot; Sam said, now sounding a bit more serious than his usually easygoing nature as he tapped the pocket in his trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what? No, I... no, nothing like that! I... I was just curious about it but I don't really want to try it!&quot; Craig sounded scared, almost like Sam was proposing to burn someone's house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suit yourself, dude. You know, I don't usually let people use my shit but I think it'd be good for you. You need to loosen up a bit, you're too trapped in yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig remained silent. &quot;Tell you what: you just tell me and I'll give you some of my shit. Deal?&quot; Sam said and held his right fist pointing at Craig. &quot;Deal&quot; Answered the other boy and he met Sam's fist with his own.<br />
<br />
Craig answered not too certain of his word. He'd only agreed because he didn't want to let Sam down. After all, he seemed really cool and he was easy to trust, somehow. It was strange, he wasn't used to have someone that emotionally close to him, it was just like they were friends or starting to become friends. Craig felt good with that thought. It'd be cool to have a friend since he didn't have many, especially at this school. It'd be great, though. Craig was already imagining both of them being friends. Hanging around town without any worries, playing some video games but especially smoking pot together. After all there wasn't a day they went on without smoking some MJ.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, dude, are you alright? Hey, Craig?&quot; Sam snapped his fingers right at Craig's face. What the fuck had just happened? Craig remembered being lost on his thoughts, something about him and Sam but he couldn't quite recall them. He shook his head looking at Sam whose concerned face shifted to a smiling one. &quot;Geez, man, pull your shit together, man! You just dozed off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam was standing up, looking really tall. When did he stand up? And what was all that? He was just thinking about something and then... what was he thinking about, anyway? He felt his whole mind blank for a second but then he looked at Sam, who was still waiting for him to talk. &quot;I'm fine, just thinking about stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam handed out his hand  to Craig while chuckling to himself. Craig grabbed it and was pulled to his feet. &quot;There's your problem, dude, you overthink stuff.&quot; Commented Sam, who proceeded to rub Craig's hair once again.<br />
<br />
Craig moved away from Sam, moving his dark brown hair back to its original place. &quot;That was uncalled for!&quot; He grunted.<br />
<br />
Sam looked amused. &quot;Just make sure to wake up. Come, we're late for class already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Craig looked at his watch. Shit, they were five minutes late already! Mr. Hastings, the math teacher, sure wouldn't like that at all, being so damn punctual. Craig never had a problem with the teacher much less with punctuality but somehow he found all that punctuality code to be stupid and annoying. Still Craig tried no to think much about it as he walked side by side with Sam.<br />
<br />
However, Craig also didn't care or even noticed that somehow Sam seemed to have grown a bit. While Sam was previously a bit taller than him, Craig had needed to be close to him to confirm the difference in heights  but now it was clear that the ginger boy was the tallest of them both. Also, Craig didn't notice that the &quot;borrowed&quot; uniform he had received earlier that day was actually more spacious than before, which made Craig feel more at ease with wearing those clothes. They felt better but it was obvious that they weren't quite Craig's size as they still felt a bit constricting.<br />
<br />
Despite all that, Craig didn't care. Even his way of walking showed that. He knew he should be concerned about Sam's growth, his own growing clothes or even the fact that they were late for class and were likely to be scolded in front of everyone in class but at the same time he didn't seem too affected by that and walked calmly through the corridors. He was thinking just how cool it was to have met someone like Sam and how awesome school would be by having him as a friend.</p>
