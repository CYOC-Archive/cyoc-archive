<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claudia weighed her options set before her by Merlin. She could maintain her adulthood but lose her humanity in the process or she could accept the inevitable and become a child again. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can make this decision,&quot; she moaned. &quot;Mika relies in me too much. I like being an adult, I like being old....I just don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika placed her hand on her 21 year old guardians shoulder. &quot;Claudia,&quot; the college girl said. &quot;This past few months have Ben the most fun I have had in years but look at it this way. Maybe Merlin can make it so we could be sisters like Mary and Katie. We&#39;ve grown so close I would hate to lose you just so you could keep your adulthood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia looked at Mika and smiled. &quot;Thank you Mika,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Okay Merlin I&#39;ve made my decision, guess I&#39;m going to be a kid again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika, Sammy, and Mary hugged the blonde girl who had an incredulous look on her face. &quot;Welcome to the club Claudia,&quot; they said in unison. &quot;Thanks I think,&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
Merlin smiled as the girls embraced. &quot;Excellent,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I was hopeing this would be your decision. I&#39;ve seen the other choice it doesn&#39;t go as well. Well, I guess that just leaves Karen and Tricia.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls looked over at the two high school girls browsing the selection of magic charms along the wall. &quot;Karen will be easier,&quot; Merlin stated. &quot;Once she gets over the shock of becoming a child she&#39;ll jump at the opportunity to be a kid again. Tricia on the other hand is going to have some trouble, like you did Claudia, your all going to have to talk her through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls sighed and looked at each other. &quot;Guess we better call them over,&quot; Samantha said. The girls beckoned the two high school girls over. Karen and Tricia were talking and smiling as they walked towards the group. Although Karen and Trica had know eachother for only a couple of days the seemed to get along well. Karen was still reserved around the others but was gradually beginning to come out of her shell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys what&#39;s going on?&quot; Trica asked. &quot;This is Merlin Trica,&quot; Mary said. &quot;He&#39;s got something to tell about Katie&#39;s ring that you need to know about.&quot; Alarmed Tricia looked at Karen who had a lok of confusion on her face. &quot;Is this really the time to talk about this,&quot; Tricia asked. Mary nodded and looked towards Merlin. &quot;Please you really need to hear this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia listened intently as merlinexplained the ring. Merlin told the girls about how they were slowly going to want to become younger, how they would be unable to escape their childhood and how Merlin was going to give them their childhood back with a guardian. Tricia vigorously shook her head and was becoming visibly upset as gravity of her predicament set in. &quot;No,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I won&#39;t become a little girl again. I have a husband, a family.....I don&#39;t even want to be a kid again. I&#39;m happy being old.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Tricia,&quot; Mary said. &quot;But eventually your going to want to be a child again just like the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Karen said. &quot;But I don&#39;t believe any of this. I&#39;m only 15, I&#39;ve known Tricia since the first grade. She was nice enough to invite me out with all of you today. This just isn&#39;t logical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;Katie must have altered your mind and reality when she regressed you. Here let me help you out and bring you up to speed.&quot; Merlin waved his hand in Karens direction. Karen shuddered and looked around at her unfamiliar surroundings. &quot;Where am I?&quot; She questioned. &quot;What do you remember,&quot; he asked. &quot;I was on my way to Mika&#39;s home to talk with her guardian about placing her in advanced classes and the next thing I knew I was here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen touched the glasses on her face curiously and began to look at her hands. &quot;What happened to me,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Why are my hands so young, why do I sound so young, who are you girls....you look familiar.&quot; Sammy, Mika as Mary smiled sheepishly at their teenage teacher. &quot;Hi Ms. Morgan,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;It&#39;s me Sammy.....uh....from class.....how&#39;s it going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SAMANTHA,&quot; Karen yelled. &quot;Did you do this. When we get back to school I&#39;m giving you detention for a month.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not her fault Karen,&quot; Merlin stated calmly. &quot;You were fated to go to Claudia&#39;s house that night and join this group. There&#39;s no need to yell, besides I know in your heart you do remember a little bit of what happened and you enjoyed yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen huffed and looked up at the college age girls in front of her. &quot;Yes I remember a little bit,&quot; she said.  &quot;I enjoyed trick or treating with Tricia, Judy and Kellie. I never had a lot of friends growing up so I never do go out with friends on Halloween. That still doesn&#39;t change the fact that I&#39;m a damn teenager surrounded by my now college age students.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that&#39;s true,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;But you must admit you wish you had a happier childhood and if you could you would relive your youth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen paused and looked at the old wizard. &quot;Well yes,&quot; she said. &quot;But that&#39;s wishful thining from an old woman whose being forced to retire at the end of the year because she&#39;s too old. Those things couldn&#39;t happen, there&#39;s no such thing as real magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess your fortunate that their is real magic,&quot; Mary said. &quot;What do you think Karen. Do you want to go back with us and be our friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen gazed thoughtfully at the group. The offer was tempting but did she really want to become a child again? Looking at Tricia she came to a conclusion. &quot;Only if Tricia went back with me,&quot; she answered. &quot;Me!!&quot; Tricia exclaimed. &quot;Why!?&quot; Karen looked at the teen girl in front of her and sighed. &quot;My memories from last night may be foggy but I remember your kindness Tricia,&quot; she said. &quot;I never had any girlfriends as a child. Most of the kids I grew up with treated me rather poorly. You treated as a friend, I couldn&#39;t think of reliving my childhood without you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tricia looked at the dark haired girl and smiled. Ever since Samantha had chosen to relive her childhood she had been very lonely. She had wanted to have a friend and had found one in Karen. While the idea of being a child again angered her she realized that eventually the ring would make her want to be a child again. Looking at Karen she smiled and shrugged. &quot;Okay,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll do it. If I&#39;m going to be a child again, I might as well have a best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; Merlin exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s settled then I will revert you all to children and give you guardians. In return I ask you return to my shop next weekend to purchase some items from my shop.&quot; &quot;What about the apprentice thing,&quot; Mika asked. &quot;I&#39;ll give you girls time to sort that out,&quot; he said. &quot;As I said before it was a test to gauge your friendship. If one of you decides one day to learn the mystic arts I will gladly teach you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Now that that&#39;s settled when do we become children again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow night at 8 o&#39;clock I will arrive at your home Claudia,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll cast my spell and return you all to your childhood as well as give you your guardians. Until then enjoy your time as adults.&quot;<br />
<br />
Girls smiled and thanked Merlin as they walked out of store, thinking about the decision they had just made.</p>
