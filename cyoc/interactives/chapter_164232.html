<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting on the ground of a filthy building that had been forgotten by time, was Jake who had witnessed the capabilities of this program on his laptop that could only come from fiction. Here it was in his lap, the power to change and altar reality however he pleases. Though he changed himself to have a t-rex snout and tail, he had accidentally changed a few of his friends into essentially a unicorn centaur and a vixen centaur. He saw it with his own eyes the things he had created, he wanted to change himself just like them.<br />
<br />
Following the same motif he did with his mouth and reptilian tail, he wanted to become a t-rex centaur. Though he wondered what that would look like first of all. He did see an option that had taur in the queue which didn&#39;t take long to realize it was a shortened version of centaur. Wanting to be surprised with what he&#39;d look like by the end he didn&#39;t look at the picture of the transformation. He of course checked on a box to alter reality for who knows how much trouble he&#39;d be in if something that looked like a t-rex started to walk down the street. He finished looking the chart over and pressed enter standing up and waited for his changes to begin.<br />
<br />
He first hurried and took off his pants, underwear, socks and shoes not wanting to totally destroy his wardrobe. He stood half naked feeling his lower body start to flex feeling the changes were now taking place. His body grew tense feeling his muscles expand mostly from his legs looking more bulkier and ticker by the second. His feet grew out as well trying to balance Jake&#39;s monster legs so it would look more proportionate with each other. His toe nails began to harden more even showing more darker and blacker than before as they eventually protruded out from his feet almost scrapping the ground. His toes eventually blew up as well showing more muscle and bone thinning out as well. The toes went from five to four to three in a matter of a few seconds as they now looked more dinosaur like. Then there was a claw that grew out behind his foot that looked just as sharp and deadly as the others in the front. While the legs looked like the mass was slowing down, his skin began to harden and crack decorating his tail, legs and feet. This effect then went into colorization with some deep red and even darker red spots dotting all around his new skin. His stomach was also growing huge by the second as well. In the process he though that he could actually fit inside there if he was still completely human, but then he thought how he was going to have to feed it. It eventually grew scales as well and getting a more yellow color. By the end his stomach was huge and round that made Jake somewhat unable to see his feet. When he thought it was all done he felt the top part of his new body begin to rip as two sharp claws pushed outwards from left to right. Long bony joints connected to them came out acting as his infamous small t-rex hands. When all was said and done he was finally done transforming when nothing seemed to happen after a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Jake stood tall but amazed that this magnificent body was all his, and he could feel every inch of it. He realized that this body looked less from what a museum skeleton would look like, but more cartoonish from his tree-trunk sized legs to his gigantic dinosaur sized gut that blocked a lot from underneath him. The thing was his human top half didn&#39;t grow to the same extent his dinosaur body did, so he looked completely disproportionate from these to bodies. It was downright comical to say the least. He was however proud of this new body that he was testing out by walking and whipping his tail back and forth. It felt totally natural the way he walked, it was nothing like walking like a human, but he felt like he walked this way all his life. He pictured that this was how the program altered reality, and a big toothy smile formed seeing himself walk down the street as a 15 or so foot t-rex taur with people not really caring about him at all. He leaned down and grabbed his laptop again with his human hands and walked out the building a new dinosaur/human hybrid.</p>
