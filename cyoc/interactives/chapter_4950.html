<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It seemed like only a minute after Jamie closed her eyes that the alarm went off, telling her and Kylie to wake up.  Kylie lifted herself off the bed, her breasts rubbing against Jamie's bare skin.  Jamie liked the sensation that it caused within her.  Kylie wiped the sleep from her eyes, and looked startled by what she saw around her.  She looked back at the bed to find Jamie laying there nude.  She spoke.  &quot;Ooh, I thought it was all a dream.&quot;  Jamie sat up in the bed and said &quot;It definitely wasn't a dream.  We experienced the same thing.  Now it's time to really start our relationship.&quot;  She reached up and gave Kylie a firm kiss.  &quot;Let's get dressed and we'll go talk to your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
They got out of bed.  Jamie quickly put on the extra clothes that she had brought with her: a pair of red panties with matching low-cut bra; a pair of tight jeans, and a red and green cotton shirt.  As she had expected the previous night, Kylie struggled to put a bra on herself.  Jamie came over and helped hold it in place while Kylie fastened it.  &quot;Don't worry,&quot; Jamie reassured her, &quot;you'll get it down in no time.&quot;  Kylie returned her kind words with a kiss on the lips.  She finished dressing herself, and looked at Jamie to lead the way.  Jamie told her, &quot;They're your parents.  You have to do the talking.&quot;  Kylie looked somewhat worried.  Again Jamie reassured her.  &quot;The curse has worked.  Believe me.  But we have to be open with them and see how exactly they react.&quot;  She gave Kylie one more kiss on the lips.  &quot;Lead the way,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Kylie opened her bedroom door.  They could hear the sounds of her parents eating downstairs.  They descended the staircase and walked into the kitchen where Kylie's parents were sitting.  Her father was looking through the newspaper while her mother was paging through a magazine.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, girls,&quot; Kylie's father greeted them.  They returned the greeting and sat down across from them.  &quot;What do you want to eat?&quot; her mother asked, starting to get up to fix them somthing to eat.  Kylie stopped her by saying, &quot;We're not hungry, Mom.  We need to tell you something.&quot;  Her mother sat back down with a somewhat concerned look on her face.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot; her father asked.  <br />
<br />
Kylie began her speech.  &quot;Look, you two have always been honest with me.  Now I need to be honest with you.  Jamie and I were talking last night.  We were thinking about all the good times we've had, about how well we know and communicate with each other, stuff like that.  But last night we found there was something else.  We found out that we were attracted to each other.&quot;  She stopped to observe her parent's reaction.  Her mother's mouth started to part, while her father's expression remained relatively unchanged.  &quot;We both came to realize that there's a feeling between us that we don't have with anyone else.  We realized that we both care for each other much more than friends do.  We realized that we're lesbians.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother let out a slight gasp while a contemplative look developed on her father's face.  &quot;We know that you may think this is crazy, or something like that, but...&quot; she reached down, took Jamie's hand in hers, and placed them on the table for her parents to see, &quot;this is real.  This is who we are.  I said we were attracted to each other.  Well last night, we acted on that attraction.&quot;  Jamie almost pulled her hand away.  She didn't know why Kylie had said that.  But she remembered that her wording of the curse said that their parents would be comfortable with them having a sexual relationship.  She reasoned that they had to know about such a relationship in order for them to be OK with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have anything to say to us?&quot; Kylie asked her parents.  Her parents looked at each other.  Her mother seemed to look somewhat shocked, but a relieved type of shock.  It was as if she was just letting everything sink in.  Her father gave her mother a look.  It couldn't be described as anything more than a normal look.  There was no emotion one way or the other.  Then he gave Kylie's mother a look as if to say, &quot;I'll handle this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, you've obviously been very honest with us.  And we very much appreciate that.  So we're going to be honest with you.  Your mother and I have suspected that you were a lesbian for a while now.&quot;  Now it was Kylie's turn to be shocked.  &quot;What?  Why?  How?&quot; was all she could muster.  She was so amazed at this revelation that she let go of Jamie's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't any one thing, hon,&quot; her father responded.  &quot;Just a series of things.  You never seemed to show much of an interest in boys over the last few years.  We thought that would be strange for you, because your mother and I were very active in that regard when we were your age.  Mostly, you just seemed to act in differently than your closest friends.  It didn't seem that you were totally comfortable with talking about things, so we just let you be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie wasn't satisfied.  She felt hurt.  She also wasn't sure why since technically she didn't exist before yesterday.  &quot;Well if you knew why didn't you tell me?&quot;  Her mother took over the explaining.  &quot;Kylie, we've always given you your space.&quot;  Kylie said, &quot;I know and I'm grateful.&quot;  Her mother continued, &quot;Just let me finish.  We didn't know for sure.  We didn't want to ask you without knowing for sure.  Your father and I wouldn't do anything to alienate you.  We love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie asked, &quot;So what, you're not disappointed with me then?&quot;  Her mother said, &quot;You've never done anything to really disappoint us.  This might come as a bit of a shock to us, but we're not going to try and change you.  You've always been you're own person, that's how we liked it.  We'd rather you grow up as you wanted to, not as anyone else wanted you to.  And no, we're definitely not going to shut you out.  We love you unconditionally.  Your father and I have both had a few friends who were gay.  They ended up having their families torn apart.  That wasn't because of their sexual preference, though.  It was because their families couldn't accept them like that.  We decided a long time ago that we'd never let that happen to us, no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her father said, &quot;One thing does surprise us, though.&quot;  Kylie's mother interrupted, figuring she would be best to say this piece.  &quot;Yes, one thing.&quot;  She turned to Jamie.  &quot;We never really thought that you would be the one to share Kylie's feelings.  I mean, you've had boyfriends, haven't you?&quot;  Now it was Jamie's turn to speak up.  &quot;Yes, I have.  But there was really no relationship there.  Like Kylie said, we feel that we know and understand each other.  And we just realized this.&quot;  She took Kylie's hand the way Kylie had taken hers.  &quot;I know that this is very real.  I know that this is what we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie's father asked, &quot;Are the two of you in love with each other?&quot;  Kylie answered this question.  &quot;We're not sure, Daddy.  We agreed that we'll just have to wait and see if we are.  I guess it will just take time.&quot;  Her father nodded, showing that he understood what his daughter meant.  Kylie's mother stood up and walked over to Jamie.  She beckoned Jamie to stand up as well.  Jamie did, not sure of what Kylie's mother wanted.  She said to Jamie, &quot;You know these last few years we've come to know you as a daughter.  You two may not be sure if you're in love yet, but as long as you're together we're going to love you like a daughter, too.&quot;  She gave Jamie a big hug that Jamie returned.  Kylie's father walked over and added, &quot;So make sure your grades stay up.&quot;  Jamie laughed at his joke and gave him a hug as well.  <br />
<br />
Then Kylie hug both her parents and thanked them for being so understanding.  Her father had one more thing to say.  &quot;Kylie, you said that you guys 'acted on your attraction?'&quot; he asked.  Kylie nodded her head.  &quot;Well let me just say this then.  As strange as this might sound, coming from your father, I'd rather you be having sexual contact than contact with drugs or anything else harmful.  If you both want to be in a sexual relationship, it's your lives, so it's your choice.&quot;  Kylie's mother added, &quot;Like your father said, we were both sexually active at your ages.  And we had to sneak around in order to be.  We'd rather you two not have to worry about that with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her father looked at his watch and said, &quot;Well, I hate to end this Kodak moment, but we have to get to work and you have to get to school.  Oh,&quot; something jogged his memory, &quot;Jamie, how are you going to handle this with your parents?&quot;  She said, &quot;I think if I'm honest with them the way Kylie was with you, they'll be understanding, hopefully as much as you were.  We'll find out after school.&quot;  Kylie added, &quot;Yea so I'll be home a little later.&quot;  Her mother said, &quot;That's fine.  You need to be there for them to see what this means for both of you.  I think your parents will understand, Jamie.  They've always impressed me as being that way.&quot;  &quot;Thanks, Mrs. Perkins,&quot; Jamie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please,&quot; Kylie's father said, &quot;if we're going to love you like a daughter, which we are, you better just call us Mom and Dad.&quot;  Jamie thought to herself, Wow.  This curse had worked better than she could have ever hoped.  &quot;OK...Dad,&quot; she said cautiously.  She gave him a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek.  <br />
<br />
Kylie's father said, &quot;OK, Marge, we better be going.  We'll see you later, Kylie.  Will we see you too, Jamie?&quot;  &quot;Maybe,&quot; she said with a certain coyness.  &quot;Don't be a stranger,&quot; Kylie's mother said.  &quot;Think of this as your home away from home...as cliched as that is.&quot;  Jamie laughed, and Kylie's parents said goodbye.  They walked out the door and the two girls were left alone in the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;That went rather well,&quot; Kylie said.  Jamie agreed, &quot;Yea, my parents should be a breeze.  They might be a little more shocked, but, judging by how your parents were, they'll get over it in an instant.&quot;  Kylie nudged up against her and playfully asked, &quot;Wanna have a quickie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, girl, you're starting to act like Trish!&quot; Jamie said.  That scared Kylie away as that was behavior she knew she didn't want to emulate.  Jamie quickly added, &quot;No, not even close.  Seriously, as much as I'd like to, we have to go to school.&quot;  She slapped her forehead.  &quot;Shit, we forgot to think of some revenge against Miranda!  Jenn's going to be pissed!&quot;  Kylie also realized that they had forgotten about that.  &quot;OK,&quot; she said, &quot;We can just come up with some ideas in the car.  You should drive.  Maybe she won't get upset when she finds out what we were doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie shot that down.  &quot;Yea, right.  You don't know her that well yet.  If it's something she feels has to be done, and this certainly qualifies, she could care less about anybody else.&quot;  She quickly added, &quot;But we can try.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright let's get going,&quot; said Jamie.  They ran back upstairs, grabbed their things for school and dashed out the door.  The day had just begun.</p>
