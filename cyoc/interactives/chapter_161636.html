<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frustrated, Jen drove around the town, she could not bring herself to allow the research facility to turn her friend into a Santa-Gertrudis cow. She had used the evil game to coax Kyle to request his transformation for a day, if just to placate her anger for what he did to her. The curse was spreading and in ways as means what Jen never expected. <br />
<br />
Suddenly a white research facility van drove hurriedly through a stop street, and directly in front of Jen, forcing her slam on her brakes as to miss from being hit by the vehicle. Whoever was the driver, Jen thought to take chase after the van, she following at a safe distance so as not to alert the driver of someone following him.<br />
<br />
Racing together along old US-6 highway, the van passed the city limits and then did a left turn onto a gravel road. As Jen followed and turned onto the road she noticed the street sign what read as “No Outlet.” She had whoever was the driver trapped, the road did not interchange with any cross streets. She drove then slower, to where she spotted the van as driven well off the road and almost into a drainage ditch.<br />
<br />
As she drove up behind the parked van she switched off her headlights and sat for a few minutes to think what to do next.<br />
<br />
From out in the humid dark night she heard a wailed cry, as if some poor animal was in pain.<br />
<br />
Decided then to look around, Jen took her emergency flashlight from the car glove-box and opening her car door, she heard again that drone cry of something in pain. The moon was about half to full but the sky night was clear and it cast a blue hue on anything of a light color.<br />
<br />
As she walked up close to the van she noted the engine as still operating, and the parking lights and lower fog lights on the van were as well turned on. The fog lights cast their dim glow out past a pasture fence, and where that awful sound seemed to originate. <br />
<br />
The pasture fence was made of common farm fencing wire and at that point in the fence the upper two wires were cut by a cutting tool. Jen stepped past the fence and proceeded with caution, walking out into the darkness. As she walked the field was mined with heaps of small marble size turds, similar to those dropped by sheep or goats.<br />
<br />
“Huroo…,” as sounded a groaned cry from out further in the darkness.<br />
<br />
Jen knelt down on one knee, she feeling the dampness of the field grasses soak through her jeans and make her knee feel wet. As again the “Huroo,” cry but this time followed by a “Ah…-ha!” <br />
<br />
Jen knew then the voice, she had heard it talking to her earlier, it was Jerry, and if what he said about his genitals being not human, he was getting off his frustrations there with a doe goat.<br />
<br />
A fancied thought and Jen yelled aloud, “Jerry, is that you out there?”<br />
<br />
“What, Jennifer is that you, you followed me here, please go, leave now, as your having kicked me did not impress either Doc Byle or the Professor, that vile government authorized, Chinese  green carded immigrant, that man who designed the Reformation process, he injected me with a phase one serum and told me to go enjoy a week of feeling my doom growing. As from my being molested and previously infected by our friend Sandy, my body is rapidly changed, and still transforming.<br />
<br />
Come no closer as I can smell your sense of feeling aroused. Please go, run to your car, as leave me, as these goats here may soon become my herd mates. Jen please go!” Jerry the laboratory technician said, his pleading voice sounded as laboring to speak intelligibly, wanting for Jen to leave him to his horrid doom.<br />
<br />
“No, I want to help you!” Jennifer said, she having lost one friend to the research facility that evening.<br />
<br />
“I am gone beyond any possible help, the Reformation process has no antidote. All transitions are in one direction only, to dehumanize a subject, and the process makes millions for the two inventors. “Naa –ouch,” damn her, my horny friend here became unsettled that I stopped my mating and took time to talk to you.”<br />
<br />
Jen heard then what sounded like weighty staggered footsteps coming toward her from out in the darkness. She flicked on her L.E.D. flashlight and illuminated a gray and mudded shaggy furred form walking, coming closer to where she set kneeling.<br />
<br />
“Jen dear friend, I am different but still in control of my faculties. My genitals had changed a year ago after suckled by Sandy. She infected me, but I told you all that already. My body continued to know changes, the growth of fur, a pelt what covers most of me from my shoulders and down to already changing feet.<br />
<br />
In you light you can see what I am now, but from the new injection, the serum, I shall change rapidly. You cannot help me; I know what is to happen, having seen dozens go through the processing. Let me come closer, and see what I am, know that such irrational science is a present-day reality.” Jerry said, as Jen seeing him in the light from her flashlight caused her to stand upright as prepared to turn and run.<br />
<br />
“I feel sorry for Carla and now you, as I understand why in the past when I asked you to date me you said no!” Jen said, she gawking as a man being so shaggy of fur and his legs changing, he could be a Sasquatch, or a Himalayan Yeti.<br />
<br />
Jerry ceased his approach, as stood wobbling on changing legs and feet. He sniffed a large inhaled breath, and letting it out he curled his upper lip in a male animal flehmen reaction to a female aroused.<br />
<br />
“Go… now, go quick, see my goat cock is rising, as your scent to my mind is rank and forcing me to become aroused where I would molest you, go, go quickly!” Jerry said as he began to groan, sending Jen running, she dropped her flashlight and ran, leaped the pasture fence, got inside her car and slam-locked the two doors, as with a body slam and Jerry was there, his goaty cock smashed against the driver side door window.  <br />
<br />
Jen started her car and put the transmission in reverse, working to smear an ejaculating goat cock’s semen as streaming on the outside glass.<br />
<br />
A hard jamming of the stick shift into forward- gearing, and her car sped off into the dark of a bad night.</p>
