<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Good thing I&#39;m the local grease monkey.&quot; Marcus said as he got out and started working on the car. He swore, this was the worst possible time for them to have this happen. Mary and Sarah stayed in the car while their significant others worked on the vehicle. They had been heading to a party, and this was literally the worst place to end up lost and with no service and a broken down car. Marcus however was the local car fanatic. Marcus Daniel Russo was known around campus for either that or for his dashing good looks. He was Italian, having wavy black hair and the roguish good looks of a fifties greaser. He was very well muscled, and thus usually wore an extra large shirt, jeans and sneaker shoes. He sometimes played up his greaser look with a black jacket - one time, Mary made him have sex with her wearing nothing but his boots and jacket. Now that had been something!<br />
<br />
Celeste was a rough and tumble young woman who had had a fling with Marcus before coming into her own as a lesbian - and while most other guys would&#39;ve been grouchy over it, Marcus had been supportive. In fact, he had helped her meet Sarah, and the two had hit it off well enough to be together to this very day. Celeste had short cut blond hair, light blue eyes, a few scars (from dealing with guys who just didn&#39;t take no for an answer), and an athletic build. She wore a t-shirt, tight jeans, and boots.<br />
<br />
Marcus felt like something was watching him out here, and he could see a farmhouse in the distance. It looked deserted, and he supposed if worst came to worst he and the others could head by there and see if they could call for help. But he&#39;d prefer not potentially involving countryfolk in their little misadventure. He had watched enough horror movies to get a negative stereotype embedded in his head. Something about banjos and people food.<br />
<br />
As Marcus went under the car, grousing to himself about how his baby kept breaking down like this, he started to feel somewhat odd. His shirt usually fit him really well, but today it was a slightly tighter fit in some areas. Fuck and it was distracting too! Marcus grit his teeth though and tried to ignore it. He kept working on the car, trying to figure out what was wrong. He could usually find out these things himself. He was quite familiar with this vehicle and its odd dysfunctions. What had he overlooked last time...?<br />
<br />
As he looked around under the car, he once again found himself feeling that weird sensation. He wondered if it was just the wind or something making his shirt feel odd on him. It was pretty windy out here, and the heat from the car might be playing a part too. His biceps seemed to be straining a little against his shirt. He wondered if he might need to go up a shirt size if his biceps were causing him this kind of discomfort. Though it was also admittedly a nice problem to have.<br />
<br />
Marcus was never as buff as some of the jocks, but maybe his occidental workouts were paying off somehow... and then he spotted it. He could see a problem that&#39;d require some gear more advanced than what he had on hand. He groaned and pulled himself back up from under the car, &quot;I got some good news and I got some bad news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hit me with the bad news first. Don&#39;t sugarcoat it.&quot; Celeste responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I saw what was wrong with the car and hoo-boy is it a doozy,&quot; Marcus grumbled, and crossed his arms in front of him, feeling his biceps fight his sleeves again, &quot;We&#39;re gonna be out here till we can get a mechanic or a tow. Maybe I overlooked that problem under there last time, maybe sudden failure. But like it or not, we&#39;re gonna have to find someone with a working phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Marcus relayed the information, Celeste found herself staring. At Marcus. She identified as a lesbian. That much was clear. But something about Marcus now exuded a sense of sex that she couldn&#39;t ignore. And she could see that inside the car Mary was blushing and looking at him in a certain needy way too. Celeste didn&#39;t know where this kind of feeling was coming from in herself. She was over guys. She hadn&#39;t felt anything for them sexually ever since she realized what her orientation was.<br />
<br />
And here Marcus was, giving her a case of the thirst more severe than any case she felt in a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could go to that farmhouse...&quot; Celeste murmured, biting her lip in order to try to fight down her reaction to Marcus. Damn, she could see why Mary went for this guy. The arms on him were incredible. She felt a sense of odd jealousy that she hadn&#39;t ever really felt before. She was butch, that was true, but she wanted for a similar sense of powerfully built muscle the way Marcus had it...<br />
<br />
Celeste shook her head and stayed back near Sarah to keep her safe as Mary got out, moving under Marcus&#39; arm as he led the way over to the farmhouse. &quot;Let&#39;s just hope,&quot; Marcus said in sarcastic fashion, &quot;The people living here aren&#39;t out to have us for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
From her position, Mary elbowed him lightly, &quot;Marcus! Country people aren&#39;t cannibals! I have an aunt from the country!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oww, geez, sorry Mary...&quot; <br />
<br />
She accepted the apology but sighed, &quot;I swear you watch way too many schlocky horror movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus walked up to the front door first, deciding if anyone put themselves in danger, it should be him first just to make sure if anything happened, the girls could run for it. Marcus knocked, once, twice, three times...and on the third knock, everyone&#39;s eyes widened. The door swung open - it was unlocked the whole time, and they could see inside a surprisingly well stocked, well kept two story farmhouse. There were even lights and multiple rooms, food storage visible via the shadow of a fridge in the distant kitchen...<br />
<br />
...Who lived here, and why did they leave it like this?<br />
<br />
&quot;Should we...go in?&quot; Sarah asked aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s check if anyone&#39;s home.&quot; Marcus answered and led the way inside, shouting around for anyone, &quot;Hey! We&#39;re lost and we need a bit of help getting our car working again!&quot; He repeated a few times and then shrugged, looking back at the girls staying put on the front lawn. &quot;Well, I tried. I say we head inside and try any phones and or computers they might have.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they headed inside, they didn&#39;t notice the jet black form of the black stallion, watching them from the shadows by the side of the house. Its bright red eyes burning like fire. It was beginning its slow acting transformation on these new guests, and anyone else who might join them in the farmhouse.</p>
