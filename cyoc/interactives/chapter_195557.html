<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeremy was playing around with the machine he started playing around with the settings and observed how many different things he could change about him. Anything from his head to his tail.<br />
He could even give him hooves, and not only for his feet. He could actually turn his hands into donkey hooves.<br />
When he saw this he thought that it was perfect for him. Since he transformed his member he must be intending to Jack himself off. Well his plans were about to be ruined<br />
He selected Derek&#39;s hands and feet and there was a slider in percent. As he was moving the slider it showed how his hands and feet would elongate and loose their fingers on the way, turning into hard keratin hooves.<br />
Without hesitation he hit apply and then disconnected his profile from the machine<br />
In the meantime Derek was very horny and playing with himself in the bathroom, however once his changes started happening he had to stop and hastily left.<br />
He felt something was wrong.<br />
A tail started sprouting from his spine which caused him to fall down due to the very uncomfortable sensation of pins and needles.<br />
Once it was done he took his trousers down and inspected the donkey tail. It was much longer than he expected and it had a black tuft at the end of it.<br />
He played around with it for a bit before his legs started cracking.<br />
The souls of his feet started elongating quite a considerable amount and his toe and pinky started receding into the souls of his elongating foot.<br />
As he was watching his feet like a scene out of a horror movie or a scene out of a movie in which a werewolf transforms. <br />
The only difference between his and a werewolf is that he was getting hooves not paws. <br />
His legs started bulking up with muscles and thickening. His joints becoming rounder. <br />
His feet did finish elongating and forming his hooks. His hooves started forming over  his pasterns and solidifying. <br />
After he regained his senses he tried to lift up his former legs however he found them to heavy. And every attempt would end with a loud clip on the floor as the hoof would hit it. <br />
Once he saw his hooves he started to get horny again and Jack himself off. In his hornyness he didn&#39;t realize that his hands were elongating and repositioning themselves under him to better support his load. Of course when you&#39;re hands are only fixed in one spot you don&#39;t necessarily notice loss in mobility. <br />
They started bulking up and once this happened he took notice. His whole body started bulking up and getting a nice coat of Grey with a white underside. His hands started elongating. His 3 remaining metacarpal bones elongating into cannons<br />
As he realised that he was going to lose his hands he used his elongating cannons as two shafts to rub his member up and down on. <br />
He reached his limit when he felt his twitching fingers solidify into a cup like hoof and loosing all sense from that region. <br />
He started spewing his last human seed on his white belly with the most intense sensation he could imagine and an unbelievable need due to not having anything to grab his members with. <br />
He started clenching what were once his hands and legs only resulting in his forehooves and hind hooves moving a slight bit backwards.  <br />
He passed out due to the pleasure and when he regained his consciousness he saw the professor and his students all around him including Jeremy. <br />
He looked disappointed however curious while saying. <br />
It appears that you had other intentions for this change by the looks of this room and the mess you have made. However you have changed more than you would have liked since you can&#39;t continue your grotesque activity. <br />
This machine will be here for 1 year and for the period of that year and tour experiments you will have to find an experiment that matches your current form. All participants get a change and your team will have to find a use for an ungulate. He said as he left the room. <br />
He just stood there on his back semiflacid with his 4 hooves on the wooden floor below him contemplating what these hooves might be useful for.</p>
