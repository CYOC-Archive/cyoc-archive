<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We all took off for the finish line. Neck and neck we kept up with each other, which surprised me. I had figured that being the only boy in the group tis would in some way give me an advantage over Maddi, Liz and Amanda.<br />
<br />
As we all crossed the finish line, none of could decided in anyone had even a lead.<br />
<br />
After some bickering between us about who had really one, Maddi finally put two fingers in her mouth and whistled really loudly. Now that she had our attention, she began to explain her idea.<br />
<br />
She proposed that we all change in a way that would alter us so that the next race would have different outcomes.<br />
<br />
After a moment of silence, I offered the idea, &quot;Why don't we all become prepubescent children? Like around the age of eleven or twelve. Heck maybe going as far back as the age of ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddi looked at me and said, &quot;That's a great idea, Thomas.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Maddi smiling shyly. We both had known each other since we had met in Kindergarten. She had met Liz around the age of nine and then had introduced me to Liz. Liz would later, at the age of eleven, introduce us to Amanda.<br />
<br />
When we had first met, Liz was a girl who was just starting to lose her baby fat and would not lose it all until after puberty. Amanda had been a slim tall girl and would stay that way until her puberty kicked in. By the time she had grown into womanhood, her body had evened itself out and she was just as pretty as Maddi.<br />
<br />
Seeing a flaw, Amanda piped up and said, &quot;Not ten or eleven. We run the risk that we turn back time and someone disappears because they had never met the group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddi was the next to voice a concern as she stated, &quot;And we have to all be the same sex and gender, otherwise someone could get an advantage over someone else.&quot; With that said, she glared fiercely first at me and then Amanda.<br />
<br />
This led to more bickering and Amanda finally solved the problem by proposing a coin toss.<br />
<br />
I handed her a quarter and she looked at the group and asked, &quot;Heads we're all girls and tails we're all boys. Does this sound fair to everyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Each of us nodded our heads and she tossed the coin into the air. The quarter sparkled and flipped end over end  before beginning it descent back down and to land with a slapping noise on Amanda's out stretched hand.<br />
<br />
Before any could see what it landed on, Amanda had flipped her hand over and slapped the coin onto the back of her other hand.<br />
<br />
Pulling her hand back, we all looked at the coin as it displayed the head of George Washington; I would have to become a girl for the next race.<br />
<br />
After a bit more bickering it was decided that Maddi would make the two wishes and that we would all regress back to the age of twelve for the next race. Closing my eyes, I listened as my best friend wished out loud, &quot;I wish that Thomas would become a twelve year old female version of himself with the appropriate clothes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately I felt a sense of vertigo wash over me and opening my eyes, I watched as the other grow taller. I felt a tickling sensation and when I went to investigate, found that my hair had started to grow out and had turned a dark red colour. The gentle wind that was blowing against my now soft skin felt nice. Then I felt a odd sensation as tingling feeling went up my legs, across my groin and swept through my chest and abdomen. As I lost the feeling of my penis and testicles, which I knew were folding themselves into the genitals of a girl, I felt something, like a fluttering feeling in my abdomen as the my inside shifted to that of a girl. At this same time, the muscle mass in my legs and arms melted away, my feet grew smaller, my hands became slender and more petite, then my waist and hips shifted to that of something more feminine. My but shank down and my torso started to shrink. As this happened my chest moved outward into a tiny A cup.<br />
<br />
I thought the transformation was complete, but I was only half correct as my body finished shifting. Next to change were my clothes. My socks vanished completely as my shoes melted and twisted themselves into a pair of light pink and white sandals. As this moment, my pants began to shrink and continued until they resembled a pair of tight dark blue cotton running shorts. As this happened, I felt my underwear grow tighter and turn into a pair of low cut bikini briefs. My shirt was the last to change as it became softer and slightly longer, so that is now hung just even with the end of my shorts were my smooth and soft legs started to extended outward.<br />
<br />
Turning to my friends, I felt a little embarrassed to be looking like this and then two things caught my attention. Looking down my shirt, I saw my small perfectly rounded preteen breasts, and noted that I was not wearing a bra.<br />
<br />
As I looked up at my friends, I felt something pulling at my ears and something lightly smacking against my neck. Placing a hand to my ears, I found that my ears were now pierced and I was wearing a pair of what my mom called chandelier earrings; more specifically a pair of small hoop earrings.<br />
<br />
Looking at my friends, all I could ask was, &quot;Why am I not wearing a bra.&quot;<br />
<br />
This brought about giggles from the girls and I found myself joining in and then Amanda said between laughter, &quot;Some girls just don't get measured for their first cup size right away. Mostly it would be a decision that your mom would make when you first get your breast buds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, I knew exactly what she was speaking of and was not in the least bothered by this information. After a bit the giggling stopped and Maddi made the next wish that Amanda, Maddi, Liz would all become twelve year old girls wearing the appropriate clothes.<br />
<br />
I watched as each girl regressed backward in age; Amanda became the tall, thin girl we remembered she was when we first met and now stood about two inches above my new height of four foot nine. Soon a bright yellow sun-dress and a pair of white sandals appeared to cover her body and feet. Liz morphed back to a girl about my height in loose fitting jeans with a blue tank top and looked like the girl I had remembered at the age of twelve who was just starting to lose her baby fat and begin the transformation to womanhood. Maddi progressed back to a small girl of four foot six and some of her baby fat also reinstated itself in her cheeks and face. Another sun-dress, this one white with blue swirls, appeared along with an oversized white sun-hat and white sandals.<br />
<br />
Grinning at each other we all began talking at once, nearly losing ourselves in our twelve year old selves, before a shrill high whistle and we all turned to Maddi, who now had two of her fingers stuck in the corners of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much as were all having fun,&quot; Maddi began, &quot;We do have a race to win and then the winner gets a wish. Plus, one of us can not remain a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here she looked at me sweetly and before I could stop myself, feeling it to be true, I replied, &quot;If it's alright, I would like to remain a girl. I don't know why, but all of a sudden, I feel my life is looking out the correct gender and sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liz and Amanda look at each other and burst out in giggles, presumably about my choice of the words 'Sex' and 'Gender'. Maddi merely looks at me and ask, &quot;Is that what you really feel. Because, if you stay a girl, I can give you fair warning that your life probably won't be easy. If you grow up from that age, I give you two things to think about; your period, which I doubt you've even had yet and eventually there might be pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought about it before looking at her and nodded, saying that I was prepared to try and face those things as they came up. Looking at the whole group, I announced something that had been bothering me. &quot;My name is Stephanie.&quot; I said pleasantly as I felt the last traces of my masculinity vanish as I gave up the name Thomas.<br />
<br />
After this, we all looked at each other and tried to settle on the wish that winner would get. In the midst of the squabbling, the only thing that we managed to agree on was that we all wanted to stay twelve and grow up again. The next thing we agreed on was that the winners wish may not do or alter anyone of the group, unless it is deemed something that would make them happy in the long run.<br />
<br />
Nodding, we agreed on these two facts, knowing that now who ever finished would not try to do anything to another person of the group; because we realized that at the moment we were happy.<br />
<br />
Lining up, we agreed to race to the big tree across the way and on the count of three were off and the winner of the race was....</p>
