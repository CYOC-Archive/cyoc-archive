<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Here is your plane ticket and ID card, I&#39;ll be seeing you at the Caraper Airfield at six P.M. today.&quot; Ms. Tomlin stated as she pulled out a small green booklet and a lanyard with a card on it. &quot;What if I don&#39;t show up.&quot; you respond smartly. &quot;If you don&#39;t show up, the client will come and get you, and you don&#39;t want that.&quot; She scowls, spooking you a bit. &quot;Ohhhhhhhh&quot; the class all hollered  in unison, some high five and others talking quietly among themselves staring up at you. &quot;Do not keep us waiting. You can leave class early to say your goodbyes, you&#39;ll be out for a very long time.&quot; She states in a foreboding tone before turning back to the class. &quot;Everybody say bye to your classmate, they&#39;ll be spending a great deal of time deep in a conservation park with a tiger.&quot; The class was relatively silent, few waved others looked away. All you felt as you left was dread, what had you gotten yourself into. <br />
Time seemed to tic by slowly as you packed up a suitcase full of clothes and knick-knacks of home as you prepared to travel halfway around the world. You told your parents and they seemed proud that you were asked to do this. Of course they don&#39;t know why you were tasked with this, but you don&#39;t want them to be disappointed as you left. 5:06 rolled by and you sighed, time to head to the Airfield. You grabbed your suitcase, said goodbye, and began your trip to Caraper Airfield. <br />
Arriving at the field you were met by two armed guards, the sight of them made you nervous as you grabbed your lanyard and prepared your ID. The two flanked your car, a tall bearded man tapped on the glass of your window and you rolled it down. &quot;ID.&quot; came a gravely deep voice, like a rock sliding over a quarry floor. &quot;Uh, uh, yeah. Here you go.&quot; You fumble with the card before showing the picture. Their was a moment of silence as they looked over the image, then you, then the image again before handing you the ID back. &quot;Climb out of the vehicle.&quot; &quot;But, but, but, i&#39;m the person on the ID!&quot; You stutter in fear, you had the feeling you were in trouble. &quot;Yes, we know. No civilian vehicles are allowed in the airfield. You&#39;ll be following on foot.&quot; All you could think at this point is &#39;What in the fuck have I gotten into.&#39; as you turn off the ignition and climb out of the car. <br />
You follow the two guards through a series of locked gates and doors, the clattering of each chain-link slowly being droned out by the sound of a buzzing engine. The three of you finally approach a hanger door, the metal exterior visibly shaking as if it was an angry hive of giant bees. &quot;So you were the depraved soul to take on this study. Well to each their own I guess.&quot; The second guard spoke, a milder voice, though raspy from years of smoking. They swung the door open and you entered. Inside sat a massive cargo plane, engines whirring at blinding speeds as they cut the air, vibrating the chamber. Near the planes lowered stairs stood Ms. Tomlin in a long fur coat, she appeared to speak to the pilot before turning towards you. &quot;A little late, but no one had to be sent. Go ahead and hand your bags to the gentlemen and climb aboard. It&#39;s about time to depart.&quot; She yelled through the vrrrring of the motors. You hesitate for a moment looking over the guards before passing them your suitcase, and walk towards the teacher. &quot;Glad you made it, you&#39;re doing great things for the future of mankind.&quot; She stated with a determined smile, guiding you up the steps and into the plane. The steps raise behind you and you depart shortly after.<br />
The start of the trip was mostly uneventful, spending most your time staring out the window and watching as the world you know disappeared behind you. &quot;Well you may be wondering what exactly you&#39;ll be doing.&quot; Ms. Tomlin broke the silence. &quot;Well as you stated i&#39;m going to be watching a tiger eat.&quot; you respond with a monotonous voice. &quot;Well not exactly, You see you&#39;ll be responsible with tailing a specific Bengal tiger named Bentley. A male who is known to be larger than others of his breed, and subsequently consumes larger quantities of food and producing larger stool.&quot; She began, &quot;Woo, woo, woo. I&#39;m not having to deal with tiger poop am I?&quot; You question, the thought actively repulsive in your mind. &quot;Well, yes. It&#39;s a big part in understanding the species diet, so you&#39;ll be dealing with Bentley&#39;s stool on a day to day basis.&quot; &quot;Oh, fuck me.&quot; you mumble putting your hands to your face in disbelief. &quot;Don&#39;t swear, we may not be in class, but my rules still apply. Now get over yourself, we&#39;ll be arriving soon and you will meet Bentley so you to can bond and grow together.&quot; She responds tartly, standing and walking to the cockpit, &quot;After all, you will be spending a long time together.&quot; She says shutting the steel door between the cabin and front.<br />
About two more hours passed as the you flew. That time you spent drifting in and out of sleep, thinking to yourself, and watching the sun set. A moment of turbulence shook you from a mild slumber and brought you back to reality. Looking out the window you watched as you glided over a dirt runway, soldiers perched on towers and spotlights shone into the dense jungle loosely separated by a concrete wall. The cabin door slid open and Ms. Tomlin stepped out, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; &quot;Wheres are we?&quot; you asked a bead of sweat drifting down your cheek as you stared at the militia outside. &quot;Deep in India. Bentley will be waiting so come along.&quot; You shuffle slowly, afraid that you were about to be put down by maybe some stray bullet or maybe were about to be Tiger chow because you made some stupid joke. Stepping off the plane you were met by the cool night air and were greeted by an assortment of languages, people, and new fears. Ms. Tomlin spoke up to the crowd of soldiers, saying something that could only be assumed as Mandarin before a guard smiled at her and pointed towards a small brick building. She nodded and turned towards you. &quot;Bentley awaits.&quot;<br />
Entering the building you immediately noticed a lack of lights, several guards, a loud generator and a large cage shrouded mostly in darkness. &quot;Ms. Tomlin it&#39;s so good to see you again came a the voice of a lanky African woman wearing a grey lab coat. &quot;Is this our participant who&#39;ll be bonding with our Tiger pal.&quot; the woman continued turning towards you. &quot;Yes Mrs. Mandal. He graciously volunteered to do it for a &#39;great cause&#39; as he put it.&quot; You look towards her as she blatantly lied, shock coming over you as it began to dawn on you how bad this was. &quot;Uhm, uh...&quot; You began to speak up until you were silenced by a piercing growl. Out from the shadows strolled out a massive orange and black striped Tiger. The guards near his cage took a step back as he approached the cage door. It&#39;s hulking body now in full view, fur glistening in the light and paws the size of female bike seats. &quot;Bentley your awake just in time. Alright are you ready to meet him.&quot; Mrs. Mandal asks you. &quot;Of course he is.&quot; Ms. Tomlin states looking towards you. &quot;Open the cage!&quot;<br />
You are walked towards center of the room as the massive predator casually lumbers out of the steel cage, staring around before his eyes lock on you. &quot;Now don&#39;t worry, he is heavily sedated at the moment so he doesn&#39;t have enough energy to pounce.&quot; You hear Mandal say from behind, the sound of tapping glass following her voice before you feel a sharp stab in your arm. Looking down you see her injecting some yellow liquid into your arm, your veins becoming visible as you eel an overwhelming searing pain surge through your body. Your joints lock up as you topple over onto the ground in front of Bentley. &quot;Ahhhhh, what are you doing!?&quot; you cry in pain, your body steaming slightly as you felt yourself slightly liquidize. &quot;Bonding you with Bentley, You&#39;ll be tailing him, under his tail of course.&quot; Ms. Tomlin responds as you see a guard guide the tiger over you. You stare in horror as you watch his head pass over you, his paws walking on both sides of your body. He strolled over you, his white belly passing by then his massive sheath then his low hanging balls before his large plump rear passed. The massive, muscular cheeks passed by, tail swinging by granting you the view of his large pink pucker. Embarrassment would of filled you if you weren&#39;t screaming in anguish. <br />
Then you heard the guard grunt, &quot;Sit you big dumb cat!&quot; pushing on Bentley&#39;s rump, causing it to descend onto your feet. A squish resonating from under his tail, disgust fills you as you could feel his pucker against your feet. Then you felt his pucker wink, your legs seemingly mimicking the movements and tugging your body towards Bentley&#39;s butt. &quot;Please, help me!&quot; you whimper as your body seems to meld with his tailhole. &quot;We can&#39;t now, your DNA is already to far merged with his anus, Guard lift his butt to show.&quot; &quot;Oh boy.&quot; He huffs raising back up his ass, showing you that you can&#39;t see his pucker any longer. The space where Bentley ends and you begin no longer exists you then felt a pinch in your chest. &quot;Helllfff meehhhh.&quot; you wheeze, you breath becoming more foul, your lips beginning to pucker as your gut melds to his ass. &quot;Please close your mouth, you&#39;ll have plenty of open air to do that in tomorrow.&quot; Mrs. Mandal states waving her hand in front of her face. Your vision begins to diminish as your head remains between his cheeks. &quot;Pffffttttttttt.&quot; You fart from your mouth as your facial features flatten as your head softens into his crack. Your eyes close as you feel another rumble surge through your body. As you finish your bonding, Bentley growls and leans forward raising you high into the air, flagging his tail up and releases a thunderous &quot;BBBBhhhhhhhrrrrttttttt.&quot; before collapsing onto you ground, tired. &quot;Can someone please grab a fan, you two place him back out into the jungle after chipping him. I&#39;m going to get some fresh air.&quot; Mrs. Mandal gagged, quickly storming out of the room.<br />
You awake when a wave of light hits your face. You appeared to be in a jungle of some sorts and felt stiff. You had the worst nightmare where you had become a massive tiger named Bentley&#39;s asshole. You go to yawn, but a horrendous taste caused you to mentally gag. A mass seemed to be lodged in you throat as you couldn&#39;t move. Looking forward you saw a large figure shifted by and fell onto your face. You began to panic, was that a dream? A growl shakes you as your nightmares are confirmed.<br />
Bentley finally wakes up, feeling well rested. He stands up in the jungle and looks around feeling two urges. Hunger, and a need to shit.</p>
