<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Merritt&#39;s thoughts raced through his mind. This wasn&#39;t some toy, or even just a secret. The Chronivac was a powerful tool, or even a weapon. Revenge or evil wasn&#39;t on his mind though, as all that filled his head was curiosity. Becoming a gorilla was a crazy experience, but he knew he could push it to lengths. Merritt checked his watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;16:00, I still have plenty of time to mess around...&quot; He said to himself, sitting down with his laptop. <br />
<br />
He dug through the settings of the Chronivac, still naked from his prior transformation. Most of the precise measurements he decided not to mess with, as he wasn&#39;t knowledgeable enough about anatomy to individually fine tune his shape. What caught his eye most was a DNA slider, right next to the species option. When he became a gorilla before, it was set to 100%, turning his body into exactly that of a gorilla. He slowly incremented the slider, bringing it to 50%, which the program accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is normally something that would be completely impossible... But I did just turn into a gorilla four hours ago.&quot; He said to himself as he browsed through the settings further. <br />
<br />
Eventually he designed on changing into monkey instead of an ape. Being somewhat familiar, but having interesting features such as a tail might be nice to try. Not far down from the species tab was one for gender. It allowed various options including specific secondary characteristics, genital types, and more. Merritt thought to himself, before selecting the female option. He debated with himself on changing his gender, but it was only temporary, and who doesn&#39;t want to see what life is like from the other side? He set the duration for his new form to be shorter than last time, at two hours instead of four. This would be a weird two hours... Perhaps even stranger than earlier.<br />
<br />
Merritt clicked the button, abandoning his worries for a second. He felt the familiar shiver ripple through his body. He wasn&#39;t recording this time, as he had his previous experience documented, so this time, he focused on every part of his body. Differing from before, his body began to shrink first, reducing his once tall height to around five feet, five inches. He held his breath as pins and needles were felt across his body, with short brown fur sprouting up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hfffff... This feels kinda nice actually...&quot; He sighed, leaning back on the couch.<br />
<br />
As he sighed, his face changed shape once again, with his nose flattening and widening a little, his lips and facial structure changing shape, although they still kept a degree of humanity. To compliment it, female features decorated his face as well, with longer eyelashes and smoother skin. His hair grew much longer, becoming about shoulder length with a feminine style. The changes migrated downwards, with his arms slimming and his shoulders caving in, making room for the modifications to his chest. Merritt&#39;s chest pushed outwards in pleasurable bursts, his nipples hardening and becoming far more sensitive. He let out a very feminine gasp as he cupped his C-cup breasts with his shifting hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck... My voice sounds so different...&quot; He muttered, staring at his chest and the new weights on it.<br />
<br />
His stomach slimmed a little bit, and his hips counteracted it, widening. While he was smaller than his human form, he had quite the feminine curves now, only accentuated as his ass swelled a little bit. The next sensation was one he was waiting for. A strong pressure on his tailbone coaxed out a new appendage, something that was wiggling behind him against the back of the couch. He looked over his shoulder, blushing at his larger butt, but more importantly his growing tail. His prehensile tail extended until it was most of the length of his body, ending in a small hook. With a bit of effort, he could find he could control it pretty freely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... This shouldn&#39;t even be real I—&quot; He froze as his hands shot to his crotch.<br />
<br />
While his manhood shrunk considerably while becoming a gorilla, nothing could have prepared him for this. His dick shrunk past the point of no return, leaving a hot and wet slit in it&#39;s wake, nestled in her fur. She couldn&#39;t help but look, spreading her legs a little wider as she felt the new sensations wash over her. As she propped up her legs, she noticed her feet changing as well, becoming closer in shape to her hands. They would take some time to get used to walking and climbing, but for now, they seemed far more dexterous than her previous forms. <br />
<br />
With the transformation complete, Merritt picked up her phone and turned on the camera. She ran her hands through her hair, made some faces, and took a few selfies. A text slid in from Etta, scaring her a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you listen to your voicemail? It&#39;s kinda last minute but I was wondering if you wanted to meet up tonight for dinner at 17:30?&quot; The text read.<br />
&quot;Shit, wrong time for messing around...&quot; Merritt sighed. She texted back: &quot;Does 18:30 work instead? I&#39;m a little busy until then.&quot; She set down her phone.<br />
<br />
For the next hour, Merritt would nearly make a mess of her apartment. She decided to climb on her shelf, knocking a couple books off of it, lift things with her tail, simply out of curiosity. After being exhausted, she sat back down on the couch, attempting to peel a banana with her feet, as she was hungry and had worked up a sweat.<br />
<br />
&quot;This device is amazing... I have to keep testing it, maybe on others as well...&quot; She said to herself, mouthful of banana and a little turned on by her new body as she looked down at it.<br />
<br />
She reached between her legs, sliding her fingers along her new sex, her mind filled with only pleasure. She started slowly at first, rubbing her clit gently, and then picking up the pace, her feet clenching as she did. While she would&#39;ve liked to finish, she heard a sharp knock at the door. <br />
<br />
Her heart stopped as she thought about what to do...</p>
