<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back in the Lab, Mary was still unaware of the changes of her body and the fusion of her human with insect DNA. Mary was still confused and afraid of the previous events and decided to leave the lab for now. As she headed to the door Mary passed by a chair which seemed pretty large to her. &quot;Why does Dad have such an over sized chair in his lab?&quot;, said Mary to herself when it hit her like a lightning strike. Everything seemed over sized and big to her, even her clothes hang loose on her. As panic started to rise in her, Mary ran to a large mirror on the wall, almost tipped over her much to large pants, and examined herself. &quot;I must first get rid of those clothes&quot;, she said, as Mary stripped down to her panties.<br />
<br />
Beside the fact that she must have shrunken by 2 or 3 foot, everything looked quite normal to her. &quot;Just don&#39;t panic now. I can fix this.&quot;, said the naked shrunken girl to herself. She noticed that her waist seemed a lot thinner and her arms legs must have also lost some of its mass. But as she looked further into the mirror her eyes started to zoom in like before and she got a cleaner view on her skin. Very small yellow hairs covering all over her body like a thin fur, which were almost not visible for a normal human eye. &quot;What is going on? I shrunk and got a fur? My eyes got better and I got thinner? How is that even possible?&quot;, asked Mary to herself.<br />
<br />
Thanks to his Dad, Mary stayed quite calm in this freakish situation and scientific curiosity started to rise in her. &quot;What could cause such a strange change to her?&quot;, thought Mary as she looked into the room. For sure, the teleporter caused this but why? Mary went to the teleporter&#39;s device console, climbed onto the chair and read some strange lines about &quot;multiple lifeforms&quot;, &quot;DNA fusion&quot; and a Wasp...<br />
<br />
&quot;A WASP&quot;, cried Mary, &quot;I hate those little annoying spiky insects.&quot;. Lost in her thoughts Mary mumbled to herself, &quot;there must have been a wasp with me in the teleporter... and during the teleportation, the little insect got somehow fused with me... I hope I can undo this. This would explain my enhanced vision and maybe the changes to my anatomy. The mass seems to be unchanged, but why I&#39;ve shrunken by almost 3 feet? And if the size reduces and the mass stays the same, then somehow I&#39;ve must got denser...&quot;. As Mary wondered about her reduced size it hit her, &quot;Insects have a chitin exoskeleton. Which is much harder and heavier than my human skin.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mary wanted to prove her the theory and touched her left arm with her right hand. Her skin felt tough and harder than usual like her skin was now made out of leather. The teen aged wasp girl also noticed that her tactile sense must have improved like her visual sense. Even if she was almost naked Mary did not feel uncomfortable in the rather cold basement. &quot;So I&#39;ve shrunken because of my heavier exoskeleton. I wonder, what else has changed about me&quot;, said Mary, pretty sure that her other senses were also enhanced.<br />
<br />
Mary tried to focus on her auditory sense and was not surprised that she could easily hear the sound of his Dad&#39;s TV in the living room, which were 2 floors and several closed doors away. But she also heard or rather felt some other strange humming noises coming from outside. As she moved to the small window of the lab, Mary saw hundreds of wasps crowding at the window. &quot;Whats going on?&quot;, asked Mary herself, &quot;It looks like those wasps wanted to enter the lab.&quot; Some of the wasps found a little hole next to the windows and were already in the lab, heading straight towards Mary. In horror Mary reflexively screamed, &quot;STOP!&quot;, while covering her head with her small hands. Immediately, the wasps stopped and landed on the floor. Silence filled the room. Mary slowly came down and thought about what just happened. Mary tried to speak again to the swarm of wasps and commanded them to hover. Within seconds, the humming sound of hundreds of wasps filled the room as the swarm started to hover. Mary experimented with this new ability and was sure, that she had full control over the wasps. &quot;Maybe, I&#39;m the queen of their hive or something like that&quot;, thought Mary as she played with the wasps, letting them form several shapes in the air like a cube, a sphere and a heart. But it was not only that she had perfectly control over the wasps, she somehow sensed the position and feelings of every single wasp. She thought, there must be something like a special bonding or so.<br />
<br />
Encouraged, she commanded a few wasps to fly towards her and to land on her arms. The feeling of the wasps on her new skin was quite pleasurable, thanks to her enhanced skin and the little hairs. Mary remembered some documentation, where beekeepers where covered in honey and bees, and lost in an arousing feeling, she commanded the rest of the wasps to fly on her until she was from head to toe covered with crowding wasps. As the wasps fast moved on her skin, a sexual pleasure build inside her, but when some of the wasps started to enter her, she could not hold it any longer. In ecstasy Mary cried, &quot;Yes, more, faster&quot;. The wasps fully obeyed her request and moved faster on her skin and inside her womanhood. Mary came hard form the sensation and blacked out from the strange sexual experience...<br />
<br />
Some minutes later she Mary woke up again and still felt some afterglow. She tried to stand up and reached out to get some support form the table, when she accidentally knocked some glass down which shatter.<br />
<br />
Mean while in the living room Mary&#39;s Dad had just turned off the TV when he heard some glass braking down from the lab. &quot;Shit&quot;, he said, &quot;they want to steal my invention&quot;, and he headed downstairs to the lab.<br />
<br />
Back to in lab, with the new improved hearing, Mary heard some steps getting louder. When she focused stronger on the sounds, she directly knew, that her Dad will be here soon. Mary thought, that he must have heard the glass falling on the floor. &quot;He cant find me like this here. Think faster&quot;, thought Mary when she came up with an idea. Mary commanded the wasps to fly to the stairs and just block the way to the lab but also to not attack him. As Mary&#39;s Dad entered the stairways, he heard a humming noise and thought, what the source of this noises could be. His questions was soon answered, when he turned on the light. Wasps were everywhere but mainly on the door to the lab. Some of them coming out of the keyhole, some from the door slit. &quot;Shit, I&#39;ve to call the exterminator tomorrow. But for now, I can&#39;t do anything. I just hope, that those bugs caused the noise&quot;, he said. He turned off the light and left the stairway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close one. I&#39;ve to be quieter from now on. One problem solved, one to go&quot;, she said, &quot;Now I&#39;ve to solve my height problem, or should I have some fun first...&quot;.</p>
