<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Before I start this, please continue this storyline in the Second Person)<br />
    God, you love this life.  One week ago, you were a scrawny 15 year old, with few friends.  Now, you are the rich, popular, muscular 16 year old Ty.  It is awesome.  You decided to change your life a lot.  Your house is now a giant mansion, with its own private gym with all the best equipment out there.  Your bedroom is huge, with a walk in closet, king size bed, and pretty much everything you&#39;d need.  Plus, you do not feel guilty about spilling your load all over your room.  Your butler cleans it every time.  On top of that, you made yourself super smart, and you&#39;d never have to do homework.  Needless to say, you love this life. <br />
    After getting home from yet another of your sport practices, you realize something.  You want more.  You go into your private gym, and it is empty.  You lock the door, and get naked.  Before you change yourself further, you do some measurements, that way, you can do a before and after comparison.  First, you start with your biceps.  You flex the beautiful double peaks, and measure it.  20&quot;.  Write that down.  After 20 minutes of measuring, and pleasure, you look at your final results.  20&quot; arms, 55&quot; chest, 30&quot; waist, 26&quot; thighs, 20&quot; calves, 8 pack abs, 9&quot; soft penis, 12&quot; hard, 6&#39;4 height, 200 lbs. weight, 5% body fat.  Then, you check your max weights.  After even more time, you come across some pretty pleasing numbers.  350 pounds on the bench press, 500 pounds on the squat, 550 on the dead lift, 250 for curls, and 300 for lats.  You are happy, but not happy enough.  Even with those numbers, you still want more.  You wish to gain 50 more pounds of muscle, and for the rest of your body to grow in proportion.  As soon as you finish saying the wish, you feel a familiar tingle, then you pass out.<br />
    You wake up naked on the gym floor.  According to the clock, ten minutes have passed, but it feels like longer.  probably because you were passed out on the ground for those minutes.  You get up and immediately go to the scale.  it reads 250.  You are elated.  It worked!  You didn&#39;t doubt yourself, but you are happy anyway.  You go to the mirror, get the tape measure, and start measuring.  24&quot; arms, 62&quot; chest, 30&quot; waist, 32&quot; thighs, 24&quot; calves, 12&quot; soft dick, 16&quot; hard.  You also notice your abs, the 8 pack you fell in love with was gone, and a 10 pack replaced it.  You always wanted a 10 pack, and now you have one.  You also grew 2 inches, making your height 6&#39;6.  And, because you gained no fat, your body fat is now at 4%.  You decide not to wait, and see how much stronger you&#39;ve gotten.  The answer is a lot.  You were able to bench a full set of 8 at 450 pounds with ease.  As you add more plates, you feel your cock hardening.  You are so excited to see what this body can do.  Finally, you find out.   540 pounds on the bench press, 800 pounds on the squat, 900 on the dead lift, 400 for curls, and 450 for lats.  You then decide to do some one arm pull ups, and you do them with ease.  But, while you were doing them, you feel a weird tingling sensation.  You stop after 100, and get on the scale.  It reads 275.  Apparently, now, when you workout enough, your muscles expand even more.  You love this.  Finally, you finish off by releasing your load.  It gets everywhere.  You can tell that at least one gallon of cum came out of your 16&quot; pleasure stick.  You use your power to clean it up, and make everyone think this was always what you looked like.<br />
    After a nice sleep, you wake up to your new body.  It felt wonderful.  You look at your phone.  43 new messages.  You look through them.<br />
    &quot;Wow, that was great!&quot;  Another message about how great you are at sex.  You know.  You&#39;ve been doing the deed for years now.  You continue looking.  More movie deals, more party invites, more sports stuff.  You are loving the popular life.  You decide not to wear a shirt to school today.  Hey, you can, it&#39;s no shirt day at school.  (Something you made up and wished for just now).  You also make it so only the hot students and teachers go shirtless.  You also wear your favorite pair of shorts.  They bring out the extreme definition of your vascular and muscular legs.  You get your brother, and you run to school, after all, now you are captain of the track team too.  You want to run.  The school is 2 miles away, but because of your ridiculously muscular body, you get there in 10 minutes, without breaking a sweat.  Your first class is gym.  This makes you happy.  It&#39;s a lift day, and you want to see your muscles grow again.  You also decide that whenever your muscles grow, nobody notices, and everyone thinks that the final result of the growth was how you always were.  You change into your lifting shorts, and head to the weight room.  Because of your donations, the weight room has all of the state of the art equipment.  <br />
    After the normal warmup, you head over to the crunch machine.  You look at your perfect abs, and set the weight to the max, 300 lbs.  It was too easy. You whip out a full set of 50 in no time.  Next, you waltz over to the bench press.  You remember that your previous best was 540, but you grew since then.  You load 650 onto it, and bench your set of 8.  Since your suppose to do 3 sets, you add 25 lbs to each side of the bar, making it 700.  You pull of 6, but it takes some effort.  Finally, you put 750 on the bar.  At this point, the bar looks like it&#39;s about to break.  You pull of 4 reps, and you feel very pumped.  You soon realize that your 26&quot; biceps look perfect, so you start curling.  You put 450 on the bar, and curl it.  By the end of the class, you weigh and measure yourself.  350 lbs, 6&#39;8, 3% body fat. 28&quot; biceps, 75&quot; chest, 32&quot; waist, 40&quot; thighs, 30&quot; calves, and a twelve pack.  You didn&#39;t even think twelve packs were possible, but here you are with one.  You decide to wish to stop growing after every workout, because you don&#39;t want to get too big.  However, you like this body.  You also estimate that your cock is 20&quot; hard by now, but you can&#39;t check in school.  After school you run back home.  This time, the two mile run took 7 minutes.  You had a relaxing 3.5 minute mile time.  You weren&#39;t even trying!  But you ran almost 20 mph without trying.  <br />
    You decide to head straight for you gym to see your new maxes.  You get on the treadmill, and run as fast as you can.  The treadmill reads 40 mph.  You ran as fast as a car!  Next, you get to the bench press.  You load 800 pounds onto it and start.  Eventually, you find that your max bench is 1000 pounds.  You are officially the strongest person alive.  You are excited to see the rest of your numbers.  Squats, 1500.  Dead lift, 1750.  Curls, 750 (per arm).  Lats, 875.<br />
     &quot;Holy shit I&#39;m strong!&quot;  You yell.  You look at your cock.  Your estimation was correct.  20&quot; long hard.  You smile as you get up on the pull up rack and start doing one armed pull ups.  in your other hand, you are holding a 500 pound barbell.  Then you switch.  You love the feeling of being this strong.  You decide that you wanted to punch something, so you wish up a pure iron wall in front of you.  With one punch, there was a large hole in it.  You smile as you wish it to go away.</p>
