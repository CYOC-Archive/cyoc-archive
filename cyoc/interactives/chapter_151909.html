<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following Kyle&#39;s suggestion, the three friends set off to find some better-fitting clothes. Their arousal was obvious, especially in Ike&#39;s case, as his hard dick was on full display, but neither he nor Kyle seemed willing to address the elephant in the room. Trevor was just happy to watch the other two.<br />
<br />
The curse has fully restored the mansion, and as the trio wandered its corridors in search of a closet, they walked past countless expensive-looking paintings and sculptures. They paused their search in the main hall, opposite the front doors, where there was a large portrait of the three men whose bodies they now inhabited. The original owner of what was now Kyle&#39;s body only had a standard two arms and unpierced ears, and Ike&#39;s original wore regular clothes, but otherwise they were identical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are those the last three people who lived here?&quot; said Ike.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; said Trevor. &quot;There weren&#39;t any pictures in the article I read, but that&#39;s gotta be it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the hell did we turn into them, though?&quot; asked Kyle. Trevor just shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I look like an expert on weird curses?&quot; he said. &quot;But I guess we&#39;d better be careful. If one curse was real, there may be others. Or, like, magical traps? I have no clue.&quot; As he said that, the stone glowed, ensuring that the boys would soon encounter more magic.<br />
<br />
Soon, the found what seemed to be the master bedroom, furnished with an enormous bed large enough for all three of them, as well as a spacious walk-in closet. Ike chose to stay naked, while the other two raided the closet for clothes that fit them. It was mostly filled with formalwear, so Trevor was soon dressed in a pair of nice pants and a pure white dress shirt. His trekking boots were too small, so he also found a pair of wingtips he could wear. Trevor was dressed in a similar fashion from the waist down, but no shirts in the closed were tailored for four-armed men. Together with Ike he quickly found a pair of scissors and cut out two holes in a wine red shirt that he could fit his lower pair of arms through.<br />
<br />
With two of them dressed and one comfortably nude, they decided to continue exploring.<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
&quot;The door&#39;s no good,&quot; said Ike. &quot;It&#39;s like there&#39;s an invisible wall that won&#39;t let me through. Trev, can you try the window?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor unlatched and opened one of the kitchen windows and tried to stick his arm outside. He was stopped by a similar barrier. &quot;Same here,&quot; he reported. &quot;I guess we&#39;re stuck here for now. At least the pantry&#39;s full...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; said Kyle bitterly. &quot;Always dreamed of getting stuck in a creepy house in someone else&#39;s body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you get to live your dream!&quot; said Trevor. Kyle scowled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go check if there&#39;s anything useful in the pantry,&quot; he said and left the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Not a minute later, Trevor and Ike heard a yelp followed by a thud from the pantry. They rushed over to find Kyle fallen over on the floor and with a scared expression, supporting himself with one pair of arms and holding the other over his chest. His shirt was unbuttoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; asked Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was-- I found a box and opened it, and something flew out, and it hit my chest--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me look,&quot; said Ike. He guided Kyle&#39;s hands away from his chest and examined what was underneath. &quot;Check this out, Trev,&quot; he said, motioning to Trevor to come over. As he did so, he saw that both of Kyle&#39;s nipples were now pierced with red barbells.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you&#39;re getting some of your piercings back,&quot; said Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not funny, dude!&quot; protested Kyle. &quot;This shit is magic! It went and flew out of the box, and now it&#39;s... It&#39;s telling me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Telling you what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to suck a cock,&quot; whispered Kyle. &quot;Trev, you&#39;ll let me suck yours, won&#39;t you? We&#39;ve done it before so it won&#39;t be weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this another curse?&quot; asked Ike.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s gotta be,&quot; replied Trevor. &quot;Kyle, what will happen if you don&#39;t do what it tells you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be punished... And I&#39;ll get a reward if I do it, so <i>please</i> let me blow you? God, I&#39;m so horny...&quot; Kyle licked his lips. &quot;Just one blowjob, please Trev...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, let me get out of these,&quot; said Trevor, unbuttoning his pants and pulling them down along with his underwear. He didn&#39;t get a good look at his new cock earlier, but it seemed big. Now that it was rapidly growing hard again, he could tell that it was at least two inches longer than his usual one, and thicker too. He couldn&#39;t take in the sight of his improved equipment however, as Kyle quickly kneeled in front of him and started licking and sucking Trevor&#39;s dick. He was rushing and acting sloppy in his curse-induced cock-frenzy, but it was more than enough to soon take Trevor over the edge. He came with a deep, long moan, and Kyle enthusiastically swallowed every single drop of his friend&#39;s cum. As Trevor leaned his back against a wall in a moment of post-orgasm weakness, Kyle sat down on the floor again and touched his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;The reward!&quot; he said. He felt his lips plump up a bit under his fingers, growing larger and prettier and better suited for sucking dick. He smiled to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you two are done,&quot; said Ike, &quot;we should keep exploring. Be careful not to open any more suspicious boxes.&quot; He turned to leave, but Trevor still noticed that Ike&#39;s face was all red and his once again hard cock was leaking pre-cum. It seemed that he had enjoyed the show a whole lot.</p>
