<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana and Sylvie arrived at the homestead, blissfully contented from their sexy fun in the lake. Sylvie shifted into her human form and placed a gentle kiss on Diana&#39;s red fur. &quot;That was... magical, Di. I swear, you just get better and better as a lover! How do you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana grinned proudly, showing off her gleaming white fangs. &quot;Dunno. I guess it&#39;s my killer body, raw sexual charisma... and great motivation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tanned blonde fluttered her eyelashes at Diana. &quot;And what motivation might THAT be, babe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana gave her mate a rough, wet lick as she stroked Sylvie&#39;s bare breast. &quot;You, Syl. You inspire me to please you a little harder each time. Human or wolf, you&#39;re the most beautiful girl I&#39;ve ever met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sylvie smiled. &quot;Thanks, Di. You&#39;re the beautiful one, though. Well, I have to go help prepare the pack&#39;s evening meal now. Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana waved goodbye to Sylvie as she ran off. Diana&#39;s face fell when someone far less delightful to be around came walking her way: her oldest sister, Luna Lyall. Luna was in her human form, and her fetching scarlet hair sparkled in the moonlight. She was naked (as she usually was on pack land), and any werewolf who wasn&#39;t Luna&#39;s sister would have been bewitched by her exposed, shapely breasts and the contours of her toned muscles into forgetting what a colossal bitch the beautiful girl was. Diana wasn&#39;t looking at Luna&#39;s boobs, though; she was looking at Luna&#39;s haughty, imperious face that announced a girl who knew with undeserved certainty that she was sure to be the pack&#39;s next alpha after Caleb Lyall died or stepped down. When dwarves fly!, Diana thought to herself. Sure, Luna was their mother&#39;s favorite, but their father the alpha strove to be impartial, and sparring matches were at least as important to succession as the old alpha&#39;s endorsement anyway.<br />
<br />
Luna stormed angrily over to Diana, her nude body shivering with rage. &quot;Mom&#39;s rank in the pack&#39;s just been suspended! Dad says she has to spend a week ranked as a delta! She actually had to plead to him not to force her to spend time as a gamma!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did she do this time?&quot; sighed Diana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk about Mom like that!&quot; Luna snarled, her usually alluring face contorted into a scowl. &quot;It&#39;s all Selena and the vampires&#39; fault, of course. Mom finally went to confront Carmilla von Karnstein about Tatiana sneaking into our territory to hang out with Selena. Well, the leech queen and that simpering blonde fucktoy she calls her consort were totally unreasonable and said they could only stop Tatiana from coming here and she and Selena could still see each other as long as they weren&#39;t on pack land! Well, Mom wasn&#39;t about to stand around and take their rude-ass shit, so she slashed Carmilla&#39;s arm open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;SHE DID WHAAAAAT?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna rolled her eyes at Diana&#39;s horrified expression. &quot;PUH-lease, Di! It didn&#39;t even do any lasting damage! Carmilla&#39;s healing factor took care of the gash in seconds! Why are you so concerned about a fang&#39;s health, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First, because I&#39;m not a sociopathic freak,&quot; Diana growled. &quot;Second, do you fucking WANT a war between vampires and werewolves? Those have broken out between vampire clans and werebeast packs in the past, and guess what? The vampires usually win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not always,&quot; Luna shrugged. &quot;With enough time to prepare, a clever werewolf pack can exploit the leeches&#39; weaknesses and wipe the floor with their pasty asses. Besides, it didn&#39;t escalate. You know what a coward Carmilla von Karnstein is. She&#39;s SCARED of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit!&quot; Diana snarled fiercely. &quot;She just knows a bunch of her daughters would die in a battle with us, even if she did win. Is it cowardly to not want your family dead? Is it courage to throw away your loved ones&#39; lives to avenge every little slight? Is THAT the kind of alpha you&#39;d be, Luna Artemis Lyall?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no right to question me OR our Mom, Diana Phoebe Lyall!&quot; Luna practically roared. &quot;I know you don&#39;t intend to respect my future reign as alpha, but mark my words, I&#39;ll put you in your place!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t about who becomes alpha,&quot; said Diana. &quot;This is about Mom putting us all in danger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that like any of this is her fault!&quot; Luna growled dangerously. Even in human form, the fury in Luna&#39;s growl could be impressive. &quot;You should be blaming your little pet Selena! She&#39;d be pathetic enough if she was just a wolfborn squatting on our land despite blatantly being human, but she&#39;s something much worse – a fang-lover! She&#39;s putting us all in danger by letting that slutty little fang into her room... and her pants. Who knows what schemes those leeches could be cooking up in their creepy-ass manor?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana rolled her green eyes. &quot;Conspiracy theorist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that big a stretch!&quot; Luna shot back. &quot;How do we even know we can trust Selena? She&#39;s a fucking wolfborn – a human born of werewolves. She just isn&#39;t one of us. She has no connection to our wolf nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana grinned, baring her fangs as she looked over her sister&#39;s human form. &quot;Says the werewolf who shaves her legs, pits, and pussy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna turned red as a beet. &quot;It&#39;s not like I WANT to, Di! But (unlike SOME people) I&#39;m aware that going to high school and college with a bunch of humans means I have to do certain things to avoid their questioning stares. Once I get my college diploma and move back onto the homestead permanently, I&#39;ll grow out my human form&#39;s body hair again. But at least I have an inner wolf beneath this human skin, unlike our pitiful...&quot; Luna trailed off and sniffed the air. &quot;Is it just me, or are there werehyenas around here? I swear I can faintly smell...&quot; Luna&#39;s eyes widened, and she darted up to Diana and buried her nose in her red fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s you, Di!&quot; Luna gasped when she quit sniffing. &quot;You&#39;ve been hanging around werehyenas. Weird, I didn&#39;t hear about a werehyena pack in town. What gives?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana crossed her furry arms. &quot;None of your fucking business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna crossed her own arms. Despite her human form being more than a foot shorter than Diana&#39;s glorious wolfgirl body, she still somehow managed to look intimidating. &quot;I think it is my business. I&#39;m the chosen heiress to alphahood of the pack, and I should know about any uninvited guests. Well, who are they? Why haven&#39;t they announced themselves to us?! Even Crimson Reynard and her awful skulk announced themselves to Dad when they came rolling into town! Remember, Dad had to stop Mom from tearing out Crimson&#39;s liver. If werefoxes can behave enough to ask permission to approach our land, why can&#39;t these mystery werehyenas?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not telling,&quot; Diana said firmly, taking care to stand up to her full height. &quot;I promised them I&#39;d keep their secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that means more to you than my wishes, than the pack&#39;s security interests?!&quot; Luna snarled. &quot;Tell me everything, last chance!&quot;<br />
<br />
Diana shook her head resolutely. &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So be it!&quot; Luna spat. She willed her shift to begin. Red hairs began sprouting all over Luna&#39;s formerly hairless body, soon thickening into a true fur coat. The beautiful redhead&#39;s toned muscles bulged to Olympic athlete proportions, and she grew more than a foot in height to seven feet tall. Her tail and extra breasts blossomed into existence as her feet became digitigrade paws and her nails became battle-ready talons. Last, her furry face bacame a lupine snout full of razor-like teeth ready to rip flesh to shreds.<br />
<br />
Fully transformed, Luna lunged at Diana. Diana grabbed onto Luna and clawed roughly at her, leaving thick gashes on her back. Luna yowled in pain as the blood trickled from her fresh wounds.<br />
<br />
Diana was undisputedly the strongest werewolf in the pack, but Luna was the most graceful and agile. Still smarting from her wounds, she deftly slithered out from Diana&#39;s ferocious embrace. She dodged blow after blow as she circled Diana, looking for an opening. She finally saw a chance as Diana repositioned herself. Luna lunged with full force at Diana and took advantage of her sister&#39;s poor footing to shove her onto her back.<br />
<br />
Luna slashed her claws across Diana&#39;s shoulder as she bit into her sister&#39;s upper left tit with her keen fangs. Diana howled with agony. The larger werewolf fought to concentrate through the haze of pain and landed a blow on Luna&#39;s exposed side. Luna&#39;s grip on Diana broke, and the two sisters tumbled about in a blur of red fur as they kicked, clawed, grappled, and bit.<br />
<br />
The sounds of the brawl began to attract some attention. &quot;Look!&quot; pointed Dawn Connors, one of the teenage werewolves. &quot;Fight! Fight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; grinned her friend Mona Packer. &quot;I wager you my favorite nose ring Diana wins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; laughed Dawn. &quot;Luna&#39;s putting up a pretty good fight. Damn, I wish I could be that nimble!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you think they might get really hurt?&quot; asked a shy werewolf girl named Juniper Woolf. &quot;Remember, it isn&#39;t just silver that can overcome a werebeast&#39;s healing factor. So can the claws and teeth of other werebeasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, who&#39;s gonna stop them?&quot; asked Mona. &quot;Once Diana and Luna make up their minds, there&#39;s no stopping either of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got that right,&quot; said a boy named Kurt Grey. &quot;Poor Azalea still has the scars from the time she broke up with Luna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mental or physical?&quot; asked Mona, giggling.<br />
<br />
Kurt smirked. &quot;Both. Diana&#39;s no better, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Juniper sighed resignedly. &quot;I know. This kind if drama is precisely why I broke up with Diana last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I broke up with her because she thought Metallica was a better band than Iron Maiden,&quot; Dawn laughed. &quot;What kind of crappy taste is that? Poor Sylvie, stuck listening to Di&#39;s garbage music.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The &#39;music&#39; she and Luna are making right now&#39;s really something,&quot; Mona remarked.<br />
<br />
Luna yelped as Diana raked her claws over the smaller werewolf&#39;s belly. All of a sudden, Luna leaped up and grabbed a hold of Diana&#39;s throat with her teeth. Diana howled in panic, wildly slashing at her attacker&#39;s shoulders in a vain attempt to push her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Moon!&quot; Juniper gasped. &quot;Somebody has to stop this somehow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave this to me,&quot; said a girl emerging from one of the pack&#39;s cabins. A copper-skinned girl with long black hair and high cheekbones stepped into view. The newcomer was none other than Lucy Littlewolf, Luna Lyall&#39;s mate and designated conscience. &quot;I see Luna&#39;s having one of her &#39;episodes&#39; today,&quot; the Klallam Indian girl said sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that again,&quot; smirked Kurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Lucy. &quot;It&#39;s as good as over now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy shifted into her russet-furred wolfgirl form, calmly walked up behind the brawling sisters, and unceremoniously yanked Luna off of Diana. Diana  sighed in relief as she massaged her throat.<br />
<br />
Lucy stared witheringly down at Luna&#39;s crumpled form at her paws. Her mate&#39;s fur was matted with blood, and chunks of her arms seemed be missing. &quot;Well?&quot; the Klallam girl spat. &quot;What have you got to say for yourself, Luna Artemis Lyall?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna groaned as she shifted back into her human form. Her bare human skin was covered in just as many bloody gashes as her werewolf body, but at least there wasn&#39;t a ton of matted fur to deal with. The battered redhead blushed beneath Lucy&#39;s stony glare. &quot;Uhh... well, I was talking to Diana, and I smelled werehyena musk on her. I asked her what werehyenas she&#39;d been hanging with, but she wouldn&#39;t say!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you tried to kill her?&quot; Lucy asked reprovingly. The glare in her brown eyes could melt butter in the winter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Luna gasped. &quot;She&#39;s my sister! I was just trying to dominate her and force her to talk, but the fight just got... out of hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You let your anger think for you again, sweetie,&quot; Lucy sighed. &quot;Darling, we&#39;ve talked about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna sighed glumly, actually feeling a twinge of guilt. &quot;I know. It&#39;s just... why can&#39;t she just accept that I&#39;m going to be the alpha someday and show me some respect?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she would if you gave her a reason to,&quot; suggested Lucy. &quot;You should try treating her the way you treat me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna raised a red eyebrow. &quot;Suck on her clit every night? Ew, no!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy sighed. Luna could become so obtuse when she didn&#39;t want to hear something. &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant and you know it. I meant you should try being kind to her. Show her that you&#39;re a real sister, that you&#39;re the kind of alpha werewolves WANT to follow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I can try... if she becomes less infuriating,&quot; said Luna. &quot;I definitely won&#39;t wreck her like this again though. I can&#39;t believe I was this close to...&quot; Luna couldn&#39;t finish the sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;See that you don&#39;t,&quot; Lucy said firmly. &quot;I can&#39;t live with being mated to a murderer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise, Lucy,&quot; Luna said as Lucy helped her up. &quot;I couldn&#39;t live with being one. Say, how about I take you over to my place and... make it up to you.&quot; She grinned slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until we get those gashes treated, honey,&quot; Lucy said. &quot;Come with me. My mom used to help our old pack&#39;s shaman with herbalism in the days before the fateful vampire attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Luna left with Lucy, Diana slowly stood up. She winced, her wounds still stinging. &quot;Well, off to the shaman for me,&quot; Diana said aloud to herself as she watched the onlookers disperse. &quot;Shit, I can&#39;t believe I lost that bad to Luna. I&#39;m just gonna have to get even better as a warrior if I&#39;m gonna be alpha someday instead of her.&quot; She winced again as she tried to walk. &quot;I sure hope Selena&#39;s fucking appreciative of me keeping hir secret.&quot;</p>
