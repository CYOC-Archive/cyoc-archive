<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>"What are you thinking about?" Zelda asked as they walked to the bus stop.</p>
<p>"Nothing much," Zack said shrugging his shoulders. "Just thinking about what I 
could do with this power."</p>
<p>"What stuff were you thinking about changing?" Zelda asked looking curiously at 
her new brother.</p>
<p>"Well I think I'll change a couple of the teachers to be more interesting," Zack said 
shrugging.</p>
<p>"Mr. Morton does need to be livened up a bit," Zelda said nodding. "He makes 
bloody battles sound boring and gives us pop quizzes all the time."</p>
<p>"How do you know about Mr. Morton?" Zack asked utterly perplexed.</p>
<p>"I used my power to give me knowledge that I would need to go to school genius," 
Zelda said rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>"We can give ourselves knowledge?" Zack asked.</p>
<p>"Of course we can," Zelda said.</p>
<p>"Then we don't have to go to school," Zack said.</p>
<p>"True but where's the fun in just giving yourself the knowledge?" Zelda asked.</p>
<p>"You gave yourself knowledge," Zack said.</p>
<p>"I only gave myself the knowledge needed to be attending school," Zelda said. "I 
know my classes and teachers, who likes me and who doesn't, who I have for friends, 
and what I've learned in school so far."</p>
<p>"You still have your knowledge from when you were Rick," Zack said.</p>
<p>"I suppressed my schooling from when I was Rick," Zelda said. "It wouldn't be fair 
to everyone else if I didn't. I can't stop you from giving yourself knowledge but I want 
to say something before you do. The fun is in the journey. Think of a trip to am 
amusement park. Sure it's fun when you get there but if you just went there without 
the travel in between you just might miss out on seeing something beautiful or 
interesting. That's part of what makes a trip so enjoyable. In fact I'm thinking of making 
myself a baby again so I can have the experience of growing up as a girl instead of 
just gaining the knowledge of it."</p>
<p>"You would really want to be a baby again?" Zack asked.</p>
<p>"I think I might," Zelda said. "No more talking about that since I see Melissa and 
Jen at the bus stop." She waved and shouted, <b>"Hi Jen, hi Melissa."</b></p>
<p><b>"Hi Zelda,"</b> they shouted back as they waved. Once Zack and Zelda were 
closer Melissa asked, "Have you heard the news?"</p>
<p>"What news?" Zelda asked cocking her head a bit.</p>
<p>"The whole cheer squad got caught smoking last night at Christina's house," Jen 
said barely able to stop from jumping up and down on the spot. "They were also 
drinking and Mike slipped something into Rose's drink."</p>
<p>"So now they have to hold auditions for new cheerleaders," Melissa gushed. "Jen 
and I are going to try out. How about you? Will you try out with us?"</p>
<p>"Well I don't think I can fit it into my busy schedule," Zelda said looking 
thoughtful.</p>
<p>"You don't even have a schedule," Jen said giggling.</p>
<p>"Well then I think I can fit it in," Zelda said then giggled.</p>
<p>"I'll never understand girls," Zack said shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Will you try out for it Zack?" Melissa asked.</p>
<p>"No way," Zack said shaking his head and putting his hands up as if to stop the 
girls. "Cheerleading is for girls."</p>
<p>"There are boys that do cheerleading," Zelda said. "In fact when cheerleading first 
started it was the boys who did it."</p>
<p>"We could dress him up like a girl," Jen said. "We would need to find a wig in his 
hair color though until his grew out."</p>
<p>"You don't find anything unusual about my hair color?" Zack asked.</p>
<p>"Well only your hair is naturally that color," Melissa said with a smile. "The rest of 
us have to dye our hair for green hair day."</p>
<p>"Oh no that's today," Jen moaned. "Cheerleaders are expected to have green hair 
today and if we don't have green hair then no one will think we're serious about being 
cheerleaders."</p>
<p>"How did we manage to forget that today was green hair day?" Melissa 
moaned.</p>
<p>"I've got it covered," Zelda said smiling. Quite suddenly the girls had green hair 
though it was obvious that it was dyed.</p>
<p>Melissa and Jen looked at Zelda with wide eyes then at themselves with the same 
wide eyes. Finally Jen asked, "What happened?"</p>
<p>Zack looked at Zelda and said, "And you were telling me not to talk about our 
power then you go and show it off to them."</p>
<p>"They're my best friends," Zelda said looking hurt. "I know they can keep quiet 
about it and if they can't I can always make it so we had dyed our hair last night."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute what power?" Melissa asked.</p>
<p>Zack sighed and said, "I don't know if we should tell you."</p>
<p>"Oh we can tell them," Zelda said pushing Zack a bit.</p>
<p>"But you said not to talk about our power then you said you had it when they 
mentioned forgetting to dye their hair," Zack said rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>"Ok so maybe I forgot myself there," Zelda admitted, "but they have wanted to be 
cheerleaders for a long time. I wanted to give them a chance at being cheerleaders. 
And before you ask I didn't cause the whole team to be caught smoking. They did that 
on their own."</p>
<p>"Will you two stop fighting and tell us what you mean by your power?" Melissa 
asked looking a bit annoyed.</p>
<p>"Well we have the power to change things," Zelda said before Zack could say 
anything. "I know you two can keep it a secret."</p>
<p>"Of course we can," Jen said obviously offended by they thought she and Melissa 
couldn't keep a secret.</p>
<p>"Can you really change anything?" Melissa asked with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Pretty much," Zack said shrugging.</p>
<p>"Then you can make that bitch Samantha into a real bitch," Melissa said with a 
mischievous grin.</p>
<p>Zelda grinned also and said, "We can do that. We'll wait until we get to school 
though so we can watch it." She then looked at Zack and said, "You should make 
yourself a girl."</p>
<p>"What!?" Zack asked stunned. "I don't want to be a girl."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't have to stay a girl," Zelda said smiling. "You would be able to 
change back when you want. Just give it a try for today."</p>
<p>"I bet you'd make a cute girl," Jen said with a twinkle in her eyes. "If you do 
become a girl for today I'll be your girlfriend."</p>
<p>Zack had always been interested in going out with Jen but had never mustered the 
courage to ask her out and here she was offering if he would be a girl for a day. He 
had heard that she was bi so that was something to consider. She would probably be 
his girlfriend if he still was a girl after today or chose to be a girl again at some point. 
He could almost see the hope in her eyes of having a boyfriend and girlfriend in one 
person. Was he willing to become a girl for a day to have her as a girlfriend though?
