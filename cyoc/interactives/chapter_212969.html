<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason laughed. This thing was powerful. He could fight boredom so easily. The clock on his phone showed him he still had about forty minutes to kill waiting for Will. The impatient young man let a deep sigh out. That was a long moment, and at the speed his transformations were going, he should slow down, or be careful. He already turned that manager into a bearded woman, and half a karate class into pregnant women. Or he could let loose and see where his imagination would let him. He fiddled with the power button on his phone for a moment before generating a new sentence. This time, he selected himself as a target and glanced at the awareness slider to ensure his own was still on. &quot;This young-looking man is looking at his phone.&quot; There! He could change it altogether. Making himself look a bit older and not be harassed for his ID anymore. Although, he knew his father always praised his own juvenile looks : the older he got, the more he enjoyed it, even. Plus, Jason wondered what that would change concerning the whole movie thing. Would he teleport into the theater next to his friend, or become scared of horror movies, to explain that he stayed out? Jason opted it out.<br />
<br />
Still standing in front of the lamaze class, Jason decided to move a bit further before someone noticed him and thought he was a freak. He decided to sit on a bench a few feet away and generated a new sentence. &quot;Jason is waiting for his friend to come back from the movie theater.&quot; Perhaps it was the lamaze class making him feel romantic, or something along those lines, or perhaps it was only a too-long celibacy, but the college student quickly changed friend to sweetheart. He didn’t hit submit yet. This would also be a big change, but one he desired far more than looking his age or a bit older. The app seemed to be quite literal, too, and Jason didn’t know if he should expect Will to turn into a woman, or them to stay the same, just as a couple. The idea was a tad bit weird. Sure, Jason already knew he wasn’t entirely straight : he had experimented a bit and had a good moment or two with a dude, but they were buddies. It wasn’t even a question of Will’s looks, or even to know if he’d be a good partner : the guy always treated his girlfriends well. <br />
<br />
Why was he doubting, then? Isn’t there a saying about marrying your best friend or something? They weren’t best friends, but that might only be because Jason didn’t really believe in such a concept. They hung out together a lot, but so did he with other mates. His brain short in arguments to counter his hormones, Jason shrugged &quot;Screw it&quot;, as he hit the confirm button. As to when he changed the Taco Bell manager’s thought, nothing seemed different. Jason wasn’t really surprised and he pressed the home button on his phone. His home screen was not a generic geometrical motif anymore. Instead, he could see his face pressed against Will’s in a twofie. Behind them, the players on the field made it obvious that the picture was taken at some match, and rather recently, by the look of it. <br />
<br />
Jason jerked his head up. A warm feeling in his guts took him aback as he saw Will like that. So, he didn’t become a woman, Jason thought with a pinch of relief. Why relief, though? Shouldn’t he prefer the company of a lady to take care of his affectionate needs? There was movement in the lamaze class. The future fathers switched position to be facing their partners. Jason grimaced. Sure, he wanted a partner, moments ago, but even then he wasn’t yet ready to start a family. Now, this idea even seemed revolting to him. What had changed? The thought got lost as Jason realized that those who were just average Joes a minute ago seemed suddenly less plain. That future-DILF had a nice butt and chiseled jaw, whereas a second one had biceps Jason’d wish to swoon in. The thought made him feel a bit guilty, though. Was it because he felt this simple looking around disloyal to Will?<br />
<br />
Okay, this last change had more repercussion than he thought. He knew he should have taken a bit more time to reflect on it before submitting the modification. It felt like it made him… gayer? Sure, he could still tell which women in the mall were prettier, but in a much more platonic way, although a girl around his age was also sexually appealing. Jason squinted, trying to force himself into his memories. He still had slept with women and men, but his appreciation of these moments now seemed inverted. The app swithched the polarity on his sexuality! He wasn’t sure if he should panic : could he even revert himself -his former self? In a few fingers motions, the app popped up and generated a sentence.</p>
