<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ashley, I&#39;m not sure about this...&quot; David told his girlfriend as they walked through a dark alley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you wanna be popular.&quot; Ashley replied as she pulled his arm. &quot;I heard all the other cheerleaders and their boyfriend are going to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, this is not a simple fashion trend. This will change our lives completely.&quot; David said but he was silenced by her when they found a mysterious man on a corner of that creepy alley, he was almost completely covered in shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; He asked the young couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;We heard that you can give us the virus.&quot; Ashley said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can, but...&quot; The man said. &quot;Are you sure about it? Once you get infected there&#39;s no way back.&quot; Ashley and David looked at each other for a second. He still seemed very worried but she looked more determined, so she nodded at the mysterious man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, these bottles are full with my special mix. I can guarantee you will become extra beautiful with this. A huge bossom and the biggest ass you can imagine.&quot; The man told Ashley before he looked at David. &quot;And for you. Feet big like a Sasquatch&#39;s... and you know what they say about big feet.&quot; It was dark but David felt a need to cover his crotch after hearing that.<br />
<br />
Ashley took the bottles while David paid the man. Then, they walked back to their homes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still not sure about this.&quot; David said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? Think about it.&quot; Ashley said. &quot;You won&#39;t only be an adult, you will be very handsome and you could drive me home instead of walking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re  almost 13, Ashley. I will drive you home in three years.&quot; David said. &quot;And I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ll be handsome. The man described a Sasquatch and they are not particularly beautiful creatures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you will be. My beautiful pretty sasquatch!&quot; She started to tickle his chin before she kissed him. &quot;Take it.&quot; She gave him a bottle. &quot;Drink it and call me when you start to feel something. Ok?&quot; She kissed him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; He managed to say between kisses. After a moment, she left him alone in the street and he started to walk towards his home. He has his eyes on the bottle all this time.<br />
<br />
That night, after wearing his pajamas and brushing his teeth. He glanced at the bottle one last time before he goes to sleep. He wasn&#39;t sure about it and he knew that he would never be. So, he took a deep breath, then took the bottle and engulfed all of its content. When he was done, he threw the empty bottle through the window and jumped on his bed.<br />
<br />
Around 3am that night, David was tossing and turning in his sleep as if he was having a bad dream. He was sweating like crazy but still in a deep sleep. David moaned and groaned silently as he tossed and turned. Suddenly, the fabric from his pajamas could be heard starting to tear open.<br />
<br />
Unaware to David, his body was starting to expand and grow taller. His legs, arms and torso stretched to the point where he was starting to get too big for his bed. He groaned in discomfort as he was still in deep sleep.<br />
<br />
Next, David’s body continued to grow longer, instead this time, he was gaining muscle. His shoulders cracked and popped as they expanded. His back cracked as it became broad and solid. Soon after, his pajamas were ripping all over the place. His thighs expanded so fast and to the point where his pajama pants couldn’t hold them in anymore. They split right open revealing his new muscular legs.<br />
<br />
David tossed and turned as his socks began to shred open. His toes were the first things to rip through the tight fabric. Then, his feet expanded as his soles grew bigger and bigger, shredding what was left of his small socks. Soon a pair of size 16 feet could be seen from the foot of the bed.<br />
<br />
David’s body instinctually flexed. His biceps, chest and abs were now completely exposed from ripping off what was left of his pajamas. Thick hairs began to sprout all over David’s body, especially on his armpits and crotch whose skin was completely covered with hair now.<br />
<br />
As his jawline became more rugged, David no longer looked like a preteen boy anymore. In his sleep, he started to pull at his tight underwear. There was no way his underwear was going to survive the change that was about to occur.<br />
<br />
As David’s face showed discomfort, the underwear began to stretch to its limit trying to contain David’s growing manhood. When his balls dropped and his dick became larger, his underwear finally gave up and tore open. David’s butt had become thick with muscle and, surprisingly, a thin layer of hair had grown there too.<br />
<br />
Once David’s body resembled that of an adult. He stopped tossing and turning, he laid there in a cold sweat. David was still in deep deep sleep which caused him to be unaware of the intense growth spurt he just experienced.<br />
<br />
The next morning, David was woken up by his alarm. He was still half asleep so he rubbed his eyes and stretched while he started to come to consciousness. He looked down and almost fall to the ground when he saw two hairy pecs and muscles all over his body.<br />
<br />
“What?! What the hell?!” David’s voice was much deeper now. He wiggled his toes to see if the large feet at the end of the bed were his, to his surprise they were. Then, he started to freak out.<br />
<br />
“Oh no! Oh no! I didn&#39;t think it will happen too fast!” David was panicking and hyperventilating. He needed to call Ashley right now!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?!&quot; Ashley said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ash, Ashley! You must came here! I drank the bottle last night and now I&#39;m a freaking Sasquatch!!&quot;<br />
<br />
“David? You sound really weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That happens when your Adam&#39;s apple TRIPLICATE ITS SIZE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok honey, you have to stay calm. I know it’s surprising but you will figure this out, you are still shocked so take a deep breath and tell me. Did you become hot?”<br />
<br />
“Really?! Is that what you are thinking right now? My body doesn&#39;t fit in my own bed!!” David yelled. “Hold on a second. Why do you sound exactly the same?” Ashley didn&#39;t reply but David could hear her mumbling. &quot;You didn&#39;t do it, right? You didn&#39;t drink the bottle!!&quot;<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, I was going to do it but then I saw some pictures on the web and then I couldn&#39;t do it!” Ashley started to cry. &quot;I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You, bitch!!&quot; David yelled. &quot;You&#39;re going to leave me alone with this?!!&quot; He said as he flexed his new muscles. He looked down and saw how long and thick everything was.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t speak to me like an idiot or I won&#39;t help you! So calm down and listen to me.” Ashley said upset.<br />
<br />
“I won&#39;t calm down! You can say that! You traitor!!” David screamed and then Ashley suddenly stopped the phone call. David immediately realized that he was alone in this.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! How I&#39;m going to explain this to mom and dad?!” David looked through his window and saw Ashley&#39;s home at the distance. He knew that dating a cheerleader wasn&#39;t a good idea.</p>
