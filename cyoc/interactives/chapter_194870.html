<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking your father back to the front door went well, and there was a fair amount of joy that flowed through your heart at the moment. You didn&#39;t think of yourself as a hopeless romantic and romantic story that were purely for romance weren&#39;t your favorite, but the fact that things had seemed to work out so well between you and Luna was something that you couldn&#39;t help but enjoy. It wasn&#39;t often that friends in high school actually got together and did well, and you had to privately admit that some of the two of you secretly loving the other and being afraid to tell the other for so long was something that sounded like it came from a romance novel. But as you returned to the kitchen and saw Luna smile as she sat at the breakfast table with her parents, the more you didn&#39;t care if it was a trope. Luna was wonderful, and you&#39;d do anything for her, especially when she&#39;d already done so much for you. Though as you returned you overheard Kellie say something as she looked between Luna and you as you came in through the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we got a lot of plans figured out so I think that&#39;s enough wedding planning for today so what do the two of you want to do now?&quot; Kellie asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d actually have a bit of a question,&quot; you spoke as you sat down next to Luna and with some of your mind drifting to what you and Luna had discussed to start the morning. <br />
<br />
This drew attention from both Kellie and Roxie as you did so. They noted that you didn&#39;t immediately continue into the question and thus Kellie gave a wave of her hand as if to encourage you to ask the question. With that you then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve talked and planned out on the wedding, which makes sense and makes me happy,&quot; you spoke, &quot;but there&#39;s also other responsibilities that are likely to be more immediate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it this was in relation to some of the job discussions you two were talking about earlier in the morning?&quot; Roxie asked.<br />
<br />
You blinked and then nodded, understanding that a lot of your senses, even in human form had increased after becoming a MILF-wolf. That including your own sense of hearing and that would also have to mean that Kellie and Roxie also had to have improved senses, including hearing. And since you and Luna had been talking about summer job hunting when the two of you first woke up on the floor in front of the living room couch, it&#39;d then make sense that her parents overheard it when they came down the stairs. And it was entirely possible that you heard something in the background but had been so focused on the conversation with Luna at the time that you&#39;d tuned that stuff out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes,&quot; you said to Roxie and Kellie, &quot;and I mean... this isn&#39;t something to say, I want to drop everything and go looking for a full-time job. Partially because some of the things I want to do is to write and tell stories. But I&#39;d still at least need some sort of summer work for the moment. Particularly with the fact that a part of what&#39;s going on now as a result of Luna turning me... and well... I don&#39;t want to be an irresponsible &quot;father,&quot; even as a MILF-wolf. Finding out that Luna felt about me the way I felt about her over the years... it&#39;s something where I want to show that I&#39;m there to help and being capable to help raise the daughter that Luna is carrying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roxie and Kellie seemed to smile with pride while Luna rubbed your shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we know that groups like the Wolf Hunters may make things rough,&quot; Luna spoke up, &quot;but Nicki did have a point that given the regulations on where we can work as MILF-wolves and the fact that it is the summer... we wouldn&#39;t have too much time before we&#39;d need to get either application in or get deals reached with the employer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s all responsible,&quot; Kellie said to you, &quot;but between tonight being the last night of the full moon and the Wolf Hunters being on their way... or potentially already here, that&#39;d be something we&#39;d want you to be careful with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We weren&#39;t looking for anything that would try to attract too much attention,&quot; you explained, &quot;just something that would work for the summer and would earn some money...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bigger questions that we hadn&#39;t worked out yet would relate on to what jobs we could go for and what I could do with my pregnancy,&quot; Luna added, &quot;particularly if we were to work together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s when you came downstairs,&quot; you then finished, &quot;so... from there, about the only thing that would be there would be with questions on possible options to try for and what would be needed. I mean... my dad had me do some summer lawn work in the past, but a lot of that was informal and things like that. I&#39;m not sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you could still do that for the summer if YOU want,&quot; Kellie commented and then gave a chuckle, &quot;though you may end up with a bunch of horny boys following you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
That raised a laugh from Roxie, &quot;or at least watching. That was funny though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this happened shortly after I became a MILF-wolf,&quot; Roxie explained, &quot;I was setting out to mow the lawn here while Kellie was resting and feeling Luna kick. And well... it&#39;d been a hot day and I might have overdressed at first. So, I got out and got started, and eventually ended up down my jeans and a sports bra, thankfully it covered everything so there was nothing obscene and it could double as a tank top... I think a neighbor boy watched me go through all the work in the course of doing it. What made it funny was that I don&#39;t think he was actually old enough to be interested in girls at the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t get in trouble, did you?&quot; you found yourself asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Roxie gave a chuckle, &quot;though it was something that made me aware on how... well... how I could attract an audience.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded at that, though didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though with Luna&#39;s pregnancy,&quot; Kellie spoke, &quot;lawn work wouldn&#39;t be a good idea... it&#39;d be exerting and could hurt the baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that wasn&#39;t something we were looking toward,&quot; you informed them, &quot;I just said it was something I did in previous summers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Roxie nodded at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be good,&quot; Roxie commented, &quot;though... it may still be something will take some work. As there are some places both of you could work together at for the summer, but many of them will require a bit more than just an agreement and planning. And after the discussion on wedding planning here this morning and some of the other things related to it... there&#39;s a lot of other stuff that would be something that&#39;ll have to wait. I&#39;ll help you get a resume written and then show you how you&#39;d fill out an application and going through with all the male to female changes that you&#39;ve gone through in becoming a MILF-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you gave a relieved smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we can go over the list of potential jobs that are open in the area that you and Luna could do together,&quot; Roxie promised, &quot;if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. Though... it may be best to rest and unwind a bit for today. Let everything sink in and think over what we&#39;ve planned out regarding the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And would then raise the question on what you&#39;d want to do for the morning?&quot; Kellie picked things back up to her question.</p>
