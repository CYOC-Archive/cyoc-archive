<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jesse and Jake ended up playing video games late into the night. Eventually Jesse just passed out asleep. Part  one of Jake&#39;s plan was set. Ever since he and his brother went back to the tent to try and reverse the swap, he realized he had more authority over his brother. Since he was getting bigger, stronger, and beefing up he knew he could take over his brother&#39;s old life. <br />
Step 1 was getting his brother to accept his place now and seeing as he was now fast asleep after a full night of video games instead of actually being with his girlfriend Karen. It seemed he had accomplished the first step. Now it was time for Jake to step up. <br />
Jake went over and grabbed his brother&#39;s cell off the floor and sent a text Karen to come over for a late night session. The phone buzzed before he even set it down. She was on her way.<br />
<br />
Jake smiled thinking about what was going to happen tonight. He went to his brother&#39;s room to look for a condom. He found them on the floor next to the bed. On his way out he passed the mirror he saw himself and really took the time to see just how much he had changed. It wasn&#39;t just his 9&quot; cock anymore. Sure it was pumping tons of testosterone into his system that was getting him amped up, but that wouldn&#39;t have been enough. He had been doing late night workouts to release the new pent up energy. It was really showing now. His shoulders and biceps were rounding out from all the free weights. All the pushups had finally led to his pecs sticking out . He flexed his pec watching it contract and bounce. It wasn&#39;t as big as his brother&#39;s muscles had been yet, but he knew it was a matter of time. He breathed out and tightened his stomach and felt each row of abs. He had always been skinny, so the abs didn&#39;t take long to start showing, but it was his favorite part. How the skin slides over each ab. Even if he wasn&#39;t flexing he could still see them.<br />
<br />
He heard a knock at the front door.  &quot;Shit&quot; he whispered under his breath. He ran to the door hoping it wasn&#39;t to loud that Jesse would wake up. He opened the door to find Karen wasted and in a pretty tight skimpy dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you didn&#39;t want me anymore Jesse. &quot; She slurred out.Jake realized she must have thought he was Jesse. Even better he thought. Karen came right for Jake and started making out. Jake used his leg to kick the door closed. &quot;Why don&#39;t we take this to my room, so we don&#39;t wake up my &quot;little&quot; brother. As they passed Jesse he saw that he was still asleep. <br />
<br />
He took Karen to his bedroom and she stopped him looking at him funny. &quot;This is your little brother&#39;s room.&quot; Jake kissed her hoping that she would forget as he led her over to Jesse&#39;s room. Jake realized that if he is going to try and take over Jesse&#39;s life he really has to start thinking of himself as Jesse. <br />
<br />
She slipped of her dress and laid down on the bed. So this is what Jesse got anytime he was horny Jake thought. Jake took off his boxers and up swung the throbbing 9&quot; he had come to enjoy. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m going to rock at being Jesse. <br />
<br />
He slipped on the rubber and grabbed her lace panties and ripped them off. He lept up on top of her. &quot;You seem different. More fiesty. I like it&quot; Karen groaned.<br />
<br />
He stuck his tip into her. Gently started pushing it in a little and then out. Then he started thrusting all the way in. She whimpered at it being all the way in.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in in the living room Jesse heard a groan in the background. More importantly he felt a tightness in his groin. He snapped awake. Finally that stupid curse is done he pulled back his underoos and saw that his dick was stiff, but it was still little. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s weird I thought it would only get hard if...&quot; He looked behind him and saw the empty chair where Jake should have been. <br />
<br />
&quot;oh yeah Jesse&quot; Karen shouted in the distance. Jesse ran over to his bedroom where the door was left wide open. He looked inside to see Karen and Jake getting into a rhythm. &quot; What&#39;s my name?&#39; Jake asked while plowing her. &quot;Jesse&quot; she screamed. He was getting more turned on and started going harder and faster.<br />
<br />
Jesse looked in awe and realized Jake was getting off thinking about him, which meant his new dick got to bone out too. He started stroking his little dick while he thought about what to do next.</p>
