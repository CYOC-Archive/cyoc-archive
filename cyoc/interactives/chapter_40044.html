<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew paced back and forth, not liking the way he stood and the way he walked now - with his chest and shoulders leading, not his feet - plus there was the problems.<br />
<br />
Number one problem was the fact that he now had breasts, a B cup, and a girl's body, but he still had his manhood as he called it, and to top it off, he was starting to feel strange again. And the stranger he felt, the more he thought about how he'd like to feel another man's touch against his soft skin. &quot;What is the matter with me,&quot; Andrew asked himself. &quot;It's almost as if I'm beginning to think like a female.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second problem was Dani. He was obviously no help what's-so-ever, on account that all he wanted to do was sit on the couch and massage his erect nipples and talk to himself in a low sultry voice.<br />
<br />
The third problem, and the easiest to solve, was for a bit, every time he walked into the kitchen and toward the patio doors, he kept wanting to strip and go skinny-dipping in the pool. In the long run, Andrew just avoided the kitchen for now, not sure what he was going to do when he wanted to eat. &quot;Well, any ideas on what we should do,&quot; Andrew asked Dani.<br />
<br />
When he got no answer, Andrew went back to his pacing. &quot;Maybe I can find an answer to my problem back at the arcade,&quot; Andrew thought to himself as he hastily left the living room and headed for his room.<br />
<br />
Inside his room, he collected all the quarters he could find, about thirteen dollars and twenty five cents total, and headed back for the living room. There he got the attention of Dani, who'd removed his bra and his erect nipple could be seen through his shirt, by saying, &quot;I'm heading back to the arcade. Maybe there I can find a way to reverse this. You coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dani looked up and for a minute he didn't answer as he continued to doing what he was doing. Finally he said, &quot;Okay, I'll come with. But first we need to stop at my house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded at this, after all it was on the way, and exited the living room to collect his shoes. Sliding them on, he was horrified to discover that his shoes where now way to big and looking at them, he guessed his feet to be about a size six now. Unhappy, he retied his shoes and hoping they wouldn't slip off his feet, he dumped the quarters into a hidden inside pocket of his coat and waited for Dani.<br />
<br />
He didn't have long to wait before Dani showed up and also put on his shoes. Seeing that Dani didn't bring a coat, Andrew opened the front door and stepped out, making sure he had his keys.<br />
<br />
Dani's home wasn't that far and luckily his sister wasn't home and neither was his parents. Slipping in after Dani, Andrew was prepared to wait, but Dani made a follow me gesture and said, &quot;Come on. I've got an idea. Something I always wanted to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew just looked at Dani and asked, &quot;What are you doing,&quot; but Dani had already disappeared upstairs.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Andrew followed him up the stairs, but stopped when he watched Dani disappear into his Maria's room. &quot;What are you doing,&quot; Andrew hissed at Dani as he walked into the room.<br />
<br />
Dani had disappeared into the closet and wasn't replying. After a bit, he stepped out, completely nude and holding a dress, blouse and a matching pair of spaghetti strap high heel shoes. Seeing Andrew, he explained, &quot;Might as well dress the part. Why don't you pick something out, Maria won't mind.&quot; and with this said, Dani began to dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you out of your mind,&quot; Andrew demanded, fighting the urge to join Dani in what he was doing.<br />
<br />
But Dani wouldn't answer, in fact he'd sat down at Marie's vanity and had started to work with her make-up, earrings and hairbrushes. And then another problem arose; the longer Andrew stood here, trying to get an answer from Dani, the more and more he wanted to enter and change his clothes for something more comfortable, because these male clothes were just so uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
And then it happened. As Dani stood and took a pair of white panties with a small red bow on the front from the dresser and began to put them on, Andrew found himself taking off his shirt and entering the room. It was only a matter of minutes before he to was nude and going through Maria's clothes.<br />
<br />
From the dresser he took a pair of button fly jeans, a shirt that came down past the crotch of the jeans, a pair of blue bikini briefs and a pair of ankle socks. Sitting down at the vanity, Andrew began to dress, making sure his penis and testicles where tucked back. Next he turned and also began to work with the brushes, make-up and earrings, something that came as a shock when Andrew found two small holes in his ears.<br />
<br />
As he finished up, applying a light dab of perfume and Dani disappeared back into the closet, a voice demanded behind him, &quot;Just what do you two think you're doing in my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scared, Andrew turned around just as Dani stepped out of the closet. Seeing his sister, Dani began to say, &quot;We were going up to the....&quot;<br />
<br />
But Marie cut him off as she squealed, &quot;Dani? Is that you? Ohhhh, you look so cut.&quot; and Andrew could see that she was fighting not to laugh out loud.<br />
<br />
Dani tried to finish what he was saying, but Marie cut him off as she saw that Andrew was the other person in her room. Clasping Dani's had, she pulled Andrew into a sanding position and looking at the both of them, she said, &quot;Well, since you two have gotten all dressed up, we might as well and go out together. How ever did you two ever fix your breasts and make them so realistic looking? Oh well, it doesn't matter, because I think we should have a girls day out. We'll get a manicure, a pedicure, our hair done, Andi you really need to do something with yours, and afterward we can go clothes shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
And as she said all this, handing a pair of high-tops to Andrew and a purse to both Dani and Andrew, she pulled both from her room and led them out of the house. As Andrew gave Dani, who failed to see it, a look that asked, &quot;Now what,&quot; Marie exclaimed, &quot;And you two hadn't need to worry about a thing. It's all on me.&quot; afterward, she began to laugh out loud.</p>
