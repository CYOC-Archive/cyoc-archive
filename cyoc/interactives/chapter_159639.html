<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We should go one at a time, just to be safe. It would be bad if we all devolved too far and then couldn&#39;t get back.&quot; He nodded to Rose. &quot;Let&#39;s start with you first.&quot;<br />
<br />
After some discussion, the three teens decided to strip down to their underwear so the most body would show. Jeff set the Chronivac up and aimed the camera. &quot;OK. I&#39;m going devolve you until you are something like a Neanderthal. When we get that far back, I&#39;ll stop and we&#39;ll see how you feel.&quot; He started the camera. &quot;Here we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose looked down at herself and felt her face. &quot;Doesn&#39;t seem much different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff watched the screen. &quot;We&#39;re going back about 100 years a second. You do look a little hairier, and shorter.&quot; It was true - some light body hair had started to appear on Rose&#39;s normally-smooth skin. And she was no longer taller than before. As they got close to a minute, the changes got more obvious. She developed body hair all over, and she had lost about 4 inches in height. At the same time, her body got thicker, and her features coarser. Her bones began to crack as they started to re-arrange themselves. “OH GOD!” she cried out in a bit of a lower sounding voice as she continued to de-evolve.<br />
<br />
Kevin and Jeff watched in awe. It was still Rose, but the changes were dramatic enough that she looked like some brutish relative. About a minute and a half in, there was a sudden and more drastic change. Rose collapsed to the ground in agony as she grabbed her head as they could hear the small bones in her face crack and shift as Rose&#39;s face shifted to a more simian look, and her skull seemed to get lower, but extend back further, a unibrow forming above her eyes. What Jeff and Kevin could not see or understand was that as Rose de-evolved her brain was shrinking as well and her knowledge and intellect was being erased, but Rose could feel it in her mind as memories of family and school began to evaporate. “Make stop! Make stop! Me for….get….stuff!” she screamed in fear, her voice now much lower with occasional grunts.<br />
<br />
As the pain subsided Rose stood up, but was slightly bent over as she them ripped off her clothes followed by her too small panties and bra, giving the boys a front row seat to Roses new body as her breasts were now considerably larger as 36 DD cups with large nipples that were fully erect and with a large bush of hair around her pussy. She them looked in awe at her now de-evolved body, it was a lot more muscular and harrier than usual, but still sexy in Kevin’s opinion. As for Rose, she could not remember what she was so upset about a moment before. It was if a cloud entered her mind.  &quot;Me like new look&quot;, grunting to herself as new instincts permeates her primitive mind.<br />
<br />
Sending a lustful glare at Jeff and Kevin, the now Neanderthal Rose decides to mate with one of them as base instincts kicked in. She lunged at Jeff, who anticipating her move dodged her and took off running as did Kevin. But a she lunged and missed Jeff, she hit the table the computer was on and knocked it over with a crash. Jeff stopped in his tracks. “Rose! No!” Rose seemed to sense she had done something wrong as she stopped in her tracks as Jeff ran back to the computer and put it back up on the table.<br />
He looked at the screen. “Oh no.”<br />
“What is it Jeff?” asked Kevin.<br />
“It inputted a new command.”<br />
“And what was that?”<br />
He looked back up at Rose who was standing there in fear.<br />
“She is going to de-evolve more now.”<br />
“How far?”<br />
“At least a million years.”<br />
Suddenly Rose felt strange again. “No. Make stop! Me Rose!” she cried out in terror as she pounded the ground with her fists as she felt more of what was left of her humanity begin to erase. “Me girl….me girl! Me Me Rose! Me not….not….ahhhh! Eeeee!!!” her body shuddered and began to de-evolve as the last of Rose’s humanity and knowledge and memories were finally erased. She could no longer stand even partially erect as she bent over and the bones in her arms cracked as they lengthened and gained more muscle as she started walking around with her knuckles on the ground as hair began sprouting up all over her body as her big toe suddenly moved itself around giving her a primate look as she de-evolved faster and more dramatically than before as she shrank in size and her face seemed to gain a muzzle as they could tell she was de-evolving into a chimpanzee. <br />
Soon it was over and all that was left of the beautiful teenaged girl was now a chimp both in mind and body.<br />
“You’ve got to do something Jeff!” said Kevin stunned at what he just witnessed.<br />
“It’s ok. All of who and what she was is stored on the computer. If we can evolve her back she will be fine. But…” Jeff’s voice trailed off as he checked the program. “Damn!”<br />
“What is it?”<br />
“There is a programming error on the screen that I have never seen before. I can’t do anything with the program as it now stands. I am going to have to figure out a work-around or figure out how to fix the software error. And that’s going to take some time.”<br />
“How much time?”<br />
“I have no idea. It could take days, weeks, months, or even years.”<br />
“What are we going to do? We can’t leave Rose like this!”<br />
“We’ve got no choice. Look we can take her to the local zoo and they will take good care of her till we figure this out.”<br />
“What about her parents of friends, aren’t they going to ask a bunch of questions?”<br />
“No, not really. The program altered everyone’s memories of her except the two of us. Rose does not exist anymore in their reality.”<br />
Jeff and Kevin got Rose to take their hand as she waddled to their car and they drove her to the local zoo, telling official that they had just found this chimp on the side of the road. The zoo was thrilled to take her as they only had a male chimp and was looking for a mate for him.<br />
As Jeff worked on the software on his computer…..</p>
