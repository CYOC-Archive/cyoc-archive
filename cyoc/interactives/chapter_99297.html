<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night went rather well, Clemens had come home a bit buzzed and Jenny did have her concerns but he didn&#39;t look completely wasted and was big enough that it provided he hadn&#39;t drunk too much it wasn&#39;t likely that he would be at risk for alcohol poisoning. Of course, while he might not be in danger of being killed by whatever amount of alcohol that he had drunk, that didn&#39;t mean that he wouldn&#39;t potentially have trouble the following day. Thankfully, with their wedding coming up and their honeymoon coming immediately after it, they had time off from their respective jobs for the real parts of their wedding. Jenny had felt pleased with herself at getting all the work she needed done, and grateful that her coworkers had gotten enough done that her catch up wasn&#39;t enough to force them to change their plans. And as she drifted off to sleep, she ran one hand down Clemens&#39; arm and feeling the smooth scales that covered his body.<br />
<br />
As she slept, Jenny had the strange sensation that being massaged or something like that through the night, particularly on the top of her legs. The sensation was like being under a thin rubber blanket while water rolled over her in a snake-like manner. She couldn&#39;t explain how this worked and it wasn&#39;t as if she was completely under water, but in a way felt good. At times it seemed to rub against the base of her foot and that tickled a little bit, but not much more than that. And these sensations went with her all through the night. By the morning, Jenny soon realized where that sensation came from. The sensation was from Clemens, himself.<br />
<br />
He had cuddled up to her in the night. One scaled arm was draped over her shoulders and had thrown the blankets off of them, thankfully the room was warm enough that she didn&#39;t feel cold. His legs weren&#39;t that close to her, but his head was and was actually resting on her neck and pressing down her hair with his bottom jaw. And what had given her the sensation of a stream of water going over her legs was actually Clemens&#39;s muscular tail. It periodically moved as he slept and that was what created the sensation, although, now that she was conscious, Jenny noted the feeling of where his belly scales overlapped each other as they slid over her skin. It wasn&#39;t the first time something like this had happened, as sleeping in the same bed had lead to cuddling between the two of them at various times. It was nice to feel close to him, even though Jenny knew that they wouldn&#39;t likely have sex with him until the Animatrix Serum was cured of its infectious nature with new Animal People.<br />
<br />
Then Clemens&#39;s tail moved and the tip ran along the bottom of the arch of her foot. The result was Jenny giving a squeal as the movement in Clemens&#39; tail tickled her foot and shooting one leg forward which caught Clemens between his legs, which served to wake him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhh...&quot; Clemens gave a pained groan and rolled onto his back, &quot;Owwwwwww...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jenny said weakly noting that Clemens&#39; voice was slightly higher for a moment, &quot;We were cuddled up... and well... your tail tickles...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that jussssssstifiessssssssss kneeing me in the groin?&quot; Clemens groaned again, his voice returning to his normal tone but still sounded pained.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but that was purely a response,&quot; Jenny said with a weak smile, &quot;your tail rubbed my foot, which tickled, and I responded a literal knee jerk action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not funny,&quot; Clemens answered.<br />
<br />
Jenny really hadn&#39;t intended for that to be a joke. Though she knew with his transformation, Clemens&#39; manhood had been drawn within him and were held internally. It wasn&#39;t like a normal human male where everything was outside the body. That didn&#39;t mean, however, that such a blow wouldn&#39;t hurt. The action though had been an accident and Jenny had no intention of hurting him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... again... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Jenny said weakly.<br />
<br />
By this time, Clemens managed to sit up and turn his tail behind him. He looked like he was recovering from the surprise wake up call that Jenny had given him,  However, Jenny watched as he continued to give rather pained groans and his head shook slightly. Eventually he leaned forward and raised his hands. In this, he ultimately put his head in his hands. Jenny frowned and sensed that something was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clemens... are you okay?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;You look as it is more than your groin that is hurting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unnnggggh,&quot; Clemens gave a groan, &quot;I think I&#39;m a bit hung over from last night... I... I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d had that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny watched as Clemens rubbed his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a ssssssssssssssplitting headache,&quot; Clemens then groaned, the throbbing inside his skull making him hiss out a little more than he would have normally. Jenny was plenty familiar with that. She remembered a party she&#39;d attended in college for her Sorority, and the hangover she endured the next morning. It wasn&#39;t good.<br />
<br />
&quot;This may be a good think in disguise,&quot; Jenny commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;How isssssssssssss thisssssssssssssssssss good?&quot; Clemens answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You now know where your alcohol tolerance is...&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;if a headache is all you have for the moment... you&#39;re not too badly hungover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That issssssssssssssssssn&#39;t very reassssssssssssssssssssssssuring,&quot; Clemens answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Jenny sighed.<br />
<br />
Clemens tried to climb to his feet, but he barely made it off of the bed before he groaned and fell back onto it. With this, Jenny was fairly certain that it wasn&#39;t likely that Clemens would be able to do much for the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you might need to just focus on focus on resting and recuperating today,&quot; Jenny said to him, concern evident in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Clemens began, &quot;Josssssssssssssssssssseph...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If need bey, I can go get him,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;You need to rest. I can bring you food and more water... along with the pain pill that you can take... but you are to rest and get over that hangover.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clemens slowly turned his head to look to her. His head still throbbed and that made him squint his eyes as he tried to endure it. Doing so blurred his vision a little, but he could still see Jenny standing there near the foot of the bed. In fact she even walked around the bed to approach him. She looked calm and concerned for him. He also knew that he was not in the best of positions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Clemens said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey... we&#39;re getting married and your cousin is a good guy,&quot; Jenny said with a smile, &quot;marriage will bring a whole host of compromises for both of us. We&#39;ll have to look after each other. Let me look after you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clemens nodded, &quot;And you remember when he&#39;sssssssssssssssssss to arrive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny said with a nod, &quot;and where he will be arriving at.&quot;<br />
<br />
And she did know. She and Clemens had discussed what Joseph had emailed to Clemens concerning his travel plans from Columbia Falls to Florida. And she did like Joseph, not as much as she loved Clemens, obviously, but they got along well. That made it very easy to either agree to or volunteer to help Joseph Patten get situated while Clemens recovered from the bachelor party.</p>
