<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Douglas hated waiting; knowing what will happen but not knowing when. It drove him crazy at times; its why he never enjoyed the times stuck in a car with his old friend John Shafer Sr, back when they were Seattle police officers for the gang task force. Watching a suspect or a suspected drug house; waiting for the evidence needed to bust up an operation. Douglas left that behind him when his friend was killed while assisting in raiding a drug house.<br />
<br />
Now he is in his office waiting for Frederick Parker and his men to assault his prescient. Frederick Parker wanting to break out his son Daniel Parker; a man charged with attempted aggravated murder of Peter Talbot, aggravated theft, destruction of private property and other assorted charges. However, what Frederick doesn’t realize is that his son was removed from the jail and sent to Seattle hours ago. Tossed into the trunk of a state trooper’s cruiser and agent Brooke Reeds acting as a prisoner to throw off suspicion; the federal agents want to use Daniel Parker to testify against his father in their R.I.C.O case. <br />
<br />
Douglas was onto his third pot of coffee when Leon Talbot enters into his office. A tall and imposing man when normal; but when in his were-lion fursona, Leon was someone you did not want to anger. Douglas Cooper however was a were-grizzly; not intimidated with anyone, regardless of their fursona or name. Watching Leon sitting down as he poured himself a cup of black coffee; Douglas listened as the man started rambling about what he just dreamt and who talked to him.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
His head throbbing as he slowly stirred from the tent he was sleeping in; Frederick groaned and winced in pain as he tried to get up. Drinking all that bourbon last night gave him one major headache; a headache he hoped one of his men had aspirin for.<br />
<br />
Getting out of his tent, Frederick screamed as the rays of the rising sun turned his throbbing headache into a raging migraine.<br />
“Everyone up,” Frederick barking; “someone get me some aspirin.”<br />
Frederick groans as he stumbles to the nearby outhouses. Entering one, Frederick is welcomed with the pungent smell of a thousand bowel movements and ammonia. Unable to help himself, Frederick wretches up the contents of his stomach; leftover bourbon and bile leaving a sour taste in his mouth and temporarily killing his sense of smell. Relieving himself of last night’s drinking, Frederick stumbles out of the outhouse and heads back to the camp site.<br />
<br />
“Why aren’t you lazy fucks up yet,” Frederick barking; “help will be here in an hour and I want us ready!”<br />
In no mood and extremely hung over; Frederick starts opening up the tents and notices something off. Not only have the sleeping bags not been rolled out, but not one person was in them. No one was in any of the tents; Frederick was all alone.<br />
<br />
“Well he’s up,” one person whispering as he watched from the blind setup over the night.<br />
“God dam,” another chuckling; “creeping up and waylaying those men last night was fun.”<br />
“Dropping them off in the middle of the night,” a third smiling; “buck naked in the woods near the border, that was priceless.”<br />
“You think this Parker fella would tuck tale and run,” the first man commenting; “guess being some big shot criminal from California, makes him think he’s cock of the walk.”<br />
“What I don’t get,” the third observing through the blind; “why didn’t we just snatch Frederick and make him take a naked stroll through the woods?”<br />
<br />
As the members of the Talbot clan watch Frederick swear and curse as he was all alone in a camp, three black Escalades pull up; leaving the vehicles were three men a piece. Frederick swears yet again; nine men including him to assault a police station.<br />
“I thought there would be more of you,” Frederick placing a hand to his head; “what happened?”<br />
“The rest were still on route for the bust out on Tuesday,” a man with a small beard answering; “we were all that arrived before you upped the time table.”<br />
“Fuck,” Frederick sitting on a chair; “is the nine of you enough?”<br />
“We got the plans of the police station,” the bearded man answering; “we know the layout and were to attack. We just need to prep and wait your signal.”<br />
“All right,” Frederick grumbling; “anyone know how to use this camping equipment to make breakfast?”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“So that bizarre man talked to you in your sleep,” Douglas speaking; listening to what Leon told him in regards to the plan they laid out for repelling Frederick’s assault.<br />
“It wasn’t the first time we talk,” Leon seeing Douglas look on surprised; “the first time was in regards to Peter after he got shot. He told me that for the pride to follow him,” Leon gulping his coffee down; “Peter will have to challenge me for leadership of the pride. Taking a were-rabbit for a mate; would be looked upon a s weakness.”<br />
“To the death,” Douglas asks; “will I need to be called to deal with a disturbance?”<br />
“I hope not,” Leon sighing; “I truly hope not. What that man; and I say man loosely, kept thing vague. Yet,” Leon pausing; “the dream I had where Frederick puts a bullet in me and killing me, that was vivid and felt real.”<br />
<br />
“This changes everything,” Douglas thinking upon the talk he had with the same man Saturday evening. Warning him that tragedy and death is on the horizon; the possibility of Darrell being an orphan for the second time, making Douglas weigh every decision he has made so far.<br />
“We don’t even know how many men Frederick will have with him,” Douglas sighing; “or when they will attack.”<br />
“The time maybe,” Leon looking at his phone; “but my brother and his son’s just texted me. Nine men in black Escalades just arrived at Fredericks camp site.”<br />
“Nine,” Douglas thinking; “that’s five deputies to each of Frederick’s men. Not including the shark himself.”<br />
“What are you thinking,” Leon looking at the sheriff.<br />
“We know what they intend to do,” Douglas getting up; “we know they are going to break the law in busting out a man no longer in here. Yet we have no concrete evidence to support this knowledge.”<br />
“You want my brother and son’s to get this,” Leon looking at the pacing sheriff; “I suggest we wait as planned. Plus,” Leon looking at his phone and smiling; “Frederick just started eating breakfast.”<br />
“Why smile at that,” Sheriff Cooper asks.<br />
“Because,” Leon grinning; “as my brother and nephews were busy making Freddie’s men vanish into the woods, they also spiked his food. Frederick and anyone else that eats, is going to have a nasty case of the shits and no toilet paper to wipe their asses with.”<br />
<br />
Douglas looks at Leon as the were-lion laughs. Shaking his head, Douglas can’t help but look on bemused.<br />
“At least it’s a non-violent method,” Douglas shaking his head; “I’m getting some breakfast you going to come?”<br />
“Sandwiches from The Local Diner in the break room,” Leon gets up; “that is what the deputy said earlier.<br />
“Good enough,” Douglas answering.</p>
