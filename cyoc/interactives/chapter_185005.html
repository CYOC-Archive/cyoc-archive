<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">YOU HAVE BEEN MATCHED WITH LANGSTON.<br />
ITEM REQUESTED: DEODORANT<br />
TIME DURATION: 4 HRS<br />
<br />
Matt stared at the computer screen. Was this real…? He tried to exit the window, but the program froze. Standing up, he walked to the bathroom. He turned the faucet on, and splashed his face with cold water. This was crazy, he was imagining things. He looked up, and immediately saw a handsome, muscular black man standing beside him.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” the man said awkwardly.<br />
<br />
Matt looked around and saw that he was no longer in his own bathroom, but in a different one. <br />
<br />
“I forgot to grab some from the store,” the man said. “I didn’t think this was real. Shit, I can’t believe you’re actually here.” <br />
<br />
The two men looked at each other for a moment, and then both laughed. Matt smelled the air. The room smelled like very masculine body odour, not exactly unpleasant to him at the moment. The man was shirtless, muscular and pretty hot.<br />
<br />
“This is actually real.” Said Matt, smiling.<br />
<br />
“I’m Langston, by the way.” Said the man. He extended his arm to try to shake Matt’s hand before he suddenly recoiled.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit! You’re naked!”<br />
<br />
Matt looked in the mirror and saw that he was indeed naked, his clothes having vanished. He looked back at Langston and saw that the already taller man was looking lower at him. <br />
<br />
“You’re shrinking!” Cried Langston. “Oh my god, I have to film this.” Langston grabbed his iPhone from the counter and started recording.<br />
<br />
Matt looked down and saw his feet drawing into themselves as he shrunk. His fingers were doing the same, his arms stiffening against his torso. His hair was slowly pulling into his head. A new smell began to fill the room, a fresh mint that Matt realized was coming from his body. A scrunching, crunching sound began as Matt’s flesh began to condense as it shrunk, hardening. Matt’s legs were withdrawing into his body now, as his knees vanished and his body rapidly became a torso and head. Langston was towering over him now, Matt felt his head being gently pushed forward to face Langston’s thighs, then further up to stare at Langston’s chest and face. <br />
<br />
Langston watched as the guy dwindled, wofting the pleasant minty smell. Langston smiled as Matt’s torso morphed, his pecs and abs loosing definition as they rounded out. Matt’s chest started to darken, hardening into a black plastic shell. The guy’s head was starting to sink into the shell, his neck disappearing into his shoulders. Now the guy’s head was starting to flatten as he stared up at Langston, the head spreading against the now white-as-snow shoulders.<br />
<br />
Matt felt a gurgling as his body began to melt and mush inside the shell of his former torso. His dwindling penis, which was resting against the cold linoleum floor, drew up and pleasurably stretched, becoming the dial. His mushy body began to harden inside the case, except for his anus which morphed with his new dial to become the apparatus that would push the deodorant up. <br />
<br />
“Almost there man,” said Langston, realizing for the first time that his cock was rock hard watching this white guy turn into a stick of deodorant. As if in reply, the tiny face that was sinking into the white mush closed its eyes and opened its small lips in what looked like a pleasurable groan. Flattening further, the eyes glazed over and white mush appeared between the lips, overtaking them and covering them. Only the slight indent of the shape of the lips was visible on the surface. <br />
<br />
With a crack, the deodorant stick spasmed as it shrunk slightly one last time, now no taller than Langston’s ankles. Langston walked over and gently picked it up.<br />
<br />
Matt felt strong fingers holding him, and then he rocketed off the ground, flying through the air to Langston’s face. Langston inhaled deeply. <br />
<br />
“Wow,” he said. “You smell just like the real thing.”<br />
<br />
Matt could somehow see as Langston’s attractive features contorted into a questioning expression, as he was rotated in the air while Langston inspected him. As Matt was held closer to the huge, muscular chest, he began to smell Langston’s natural smell. Matt began to fixate on the smell, enjoying its masculine odour. He wanted more.<br />
<br />
“Well,” said Langston. “Let’s see how this goes.”<br />
<br />
Matt was moving again, and Langston’s arm was lifting up. The smell was growing stronger and stronger, overtaking all of Matt’s senses. It was the most beautiful smell Matt had ever experienced, and he just wanted to stay where he could smell it forever, protected and safe. Suddenly, Matt was enmeshed in a thatch of sweaty hair, and his face was pressed against the sweaty moist surface of Langston’s armpit. The feeling was electric as he mushed against the man’s sweaty, stinky skin, melting away from his body and coating the dark surface. Now his cock was being played with, as Langston spun his dial, sending waves of pleasure through his body. <br />
<br />
He was moving again, now towards Langston’s left arm. Again, he felt the electric pleasure as he made contact with Langston’s armpit, melting slightly from the man’s body heat. The armpit sweat mixed with Matt’s mush. As his body pulled away, Matt now felt the bizarre sensation of his consciousness existing in three places. The feeling of existing in Langston’s armpits was intoxicating and overpowering, but he could still feel his body being placed on the counter, with a light coating of Langston’s sweat soaking into it.<br />
<br />
“I’ll find an old cap for you.” Langston said. “Wouldn’t want you to dry out.” He bent down to open the cabinet and find a deodorant cap for Matt. <br />
<br />
As Langston moved, his muscles rippling beneath his skin, Matt began to moisten. Langston’s body heat was melting his already mushy body, and his masculine sweat began to mix with Matt. Matt’s mind was starting to change as he absorbed more of Langston’s pungent sweat. He was a part of this man’s body, nothing more than water sweating out and absorbing back in the beautiful dark skin. <br />
<br />
Langston found a cap and placed it on Matt’s torso, snapping it on, sending a wave through Matt’s consciousness. No, he was Matt, the deodorant thought. He had become another man’s object, but he was still a human being… wasn’t he? These feelings faded as the aroma of Langston’s body reasserted itself, taking over his thoughts. It smelled so strong, so masculine and hot, so dominant. Matt relaxed, grew used to his new surroundings and further mixed with Langston’s salty sweat, losing more and more of his human thoughts.<br />
<br />
That was fucking hot, Langston thought. I hope that little guy liked it as much as I did.<br />
<br />
Langston went downstairs, and grabbed his black tank top, pulling it over his rippling muscles down to his v-shaped torso, resting at his navel. He took a last swig of water, then opened the door and ran outside. He had to run 10k today.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the temperature changed! There was heat everywhere now. Langston’s body temperature increased, and new droplets of sweat began to form out of the skin around and underneath Matt, accumulating at the base of Langston’s armpit hairs. The smell grew stronger, and Matt’s mind emptied. There was nothing else other than Langston’s body, his scent, his musk. Matt began to heat up, and as he did his solid body began to moisten. More sweat formed from Langston’s skin, and losing his solidity, Matt soaked it in. Matt’s identity began to mix, as molecules from Langston mixed with Matt’s deodorant body. There was no him, he was Langston’s body. He belonged in and around Langston. He was Langston. As Matt surrendered to Langston’s overwhelming pheromones, his body completely lost its solid form. <br />
<br />
Langston ran, the beats pumping in his ear. It was so hot today, but he felt more energy than he ever had before. He felt like a machine, that he could go all day, fuck the heat. He peeled off his tank top, stuffing it in his back pocket. Now shirtless, the rays of the sun beat down on his sweaty torso. Langston pushed forward. <br />
<br />
The deodorant began to run, slowly falling down the salty side of Langston’s torso, spreading, mixing with the sweat and soaking into the warm skin. Now, the deodorant want merely in two places at once, it was everywhere. It’s mind was completely unprepared for the mindfuck it experienced as it simultaneously slid down the rippling sides of Langston‘s torso, clung to his armpit hair, collected in between Langston‘s ass cheeks, ran down his legs, gathered at the root of his penis, and soaked his back. So spread apart all over Langston’s body now and confronted by unrelenting temperature, body heat and the overpowering salty masculine scent, the deodorant did the only thing it could think to do now. It soaked into Langston’s body irrevocably, and it was then a part of Langston. The last conscious thought of the deodorant was how happy it was.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back on the bathroom counter, the remaining Matt could feel the belonging the deodorant felt as it soaked into Langston, and it only longed to join the rest of its former body in sexual bliss.</p>
