<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie sighed as she walked arm and arm with Josh out of the mall wishing she wouldn&#39;t have to worry about anyone and could focus on Josh for the afternoon. The wish itself was not age related but just the longing of a college girl with a handsome and nice guy. As the two strolled towards the exit Katie gave a furtive glance backwards. She would text Mary shortly to let her know what was going on in the mean time she was going to enjoy an afternoon with Josh.<br />
<br />
Unknown to Katie as she walked with Josh was an old man watching her from the store he had recently &quot;opened&quot; in the mall. Merlin smiled as Katie walked out. The wizard had crafted the Ring of Age centuries ago and had wondered what had happened to it since Bobby had taken it some months ago. Merlin had knowledge of all the &quot;choices&quot; and possible outcomes that had come from the ring. Some of those choices were interesting to say the least thankful he now seemed to find himself in a reality where the choices had turned out pleasantly. What would happen now though would be interesting. <br />
<br />
Merlin turned towards the front of the shop as Mary, Sammy, Mika, Claudia, Tricia and Karen entered the store. The two high school girls separated from the college girls who were making there way towards the counter. Merlin smiled impishly as Mary, Sammy, Claudia and Mika approached the counter. &quot;Welcome ladies,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve been expecting you although I must say I thought Katie was going to be with you when you came.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group stopped short and gaped at the old man. &quot;Do we know you?&quot; Mary asked. &quot;Yes and no,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;My name is Merlin and I&#39;m the reason you&#39;ve all recaptured your youth.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls looked nervously at each other before turning to to Merlin. &quot;How do you know about that?&quot; Claudia asked nervously. &quot;I&#39;m the one that created the Ring of Age Claudia,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
The girls looked at the old man in shock, while they knew that the ring was magical they never would of believed that they would ever find the man that  created it. As the girls were about to ask Merlin a series of questions the old man out up his hand and smiled. &quot;I already know you have a lot of questions, &quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve seen some of the other choices that have been made so I know there are going to be lots of questions. I&#39;m just glad that bobby lost the ring, wasn&#39;t a fan of his choices.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you talking too?&quot; Mika asked. &quot;Just a little fourth wall talk,&quot; he answered. &quot;Anyway let me catch you girls up. You already know about the ring how it changes ages and how quite a few of you decided to relive your childhood. The good news is that I&#39;ve seen the future for you and it&#39;s promising all of you turn out great, at least in most of the futures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um what about the others?&quot; Mika asked. &quot;There in lies the problem,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;Unfortunately their is a couple of side effects to the ring. The first is that the person that uses the the ring has a subconscious influence on the people it&#39;s used on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What exactly does that mean,&quot; Sammy asked. &quot;It means that Katie was an innocent seven year old when she first used the ring her innocence is rubbing off on you when she makes changes to your ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound so bad,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;Actually it&#39;s pretty nice,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;The downside is that all of you want to become younger and younger. That&#39;s the reason Mary, Mika, and Sammy decided to become kids again. It&#39;s also the reason that Karen over their is going to want to become  a child again as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls stared dumbfounded at Merlin&#39; as they took in what he had to say. &quot;That&#39;s crazy,&quot; Sammy said. &quot;I made this decision myself, I did it for me and Jake. As far as Karen is concerned we don&#39;t even know her, when we turn back she&#39;s our fifth grade teacher. I think you got this one wrong Dumbledore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dumbledore,&quot; Merlin huffed. &quot;That hack wishes he had my magic. I&#39;ve got more magic in my big toe than he has in his whole body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about Sammy Mr. Merlin,&quot; Mary apologized. &quot;She has a tendency to spurt things out without thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;But I do know that the ring is affecting her. Only a couple of months she would have never thought of reliving her youth as she is now. Now she sees it as normal she won&#39;t admit it but she&#39;s trying to not only relive her childhood but change it as well. It&#39;s happening to all of you eventually the feeling will make you all want to be children.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls looked at each other and pondered what they had just heard. Hearing that they would all eventually become children was overwhelming, especially for Claudia. &quot;I think I need to sit down,&quot; she said. Merlin smiled waving his hand and causing an chair to appear behind Claudia. Taking a seat she now looked at the wizard with a look of concern. &quot;How can we stop this,&quot; she asked. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a kid again, besides I&#39;m Mika&#39;s guardian I can&#39;t be a kid again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Claudia but eventually you&#39;ll want to be,&quot; Merlin said. &quot;Don&#39;t blame Katie she had no idea the ring would do this and she will eventually find a way for you all to be children without people wondering why two kids are living alone but that&#39;s a story for another day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Merlin,&quot; Mary said quietly. &quot;I believe you but what about Karen and what is the other bad news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When Karen gets changed back she will have knowledge of the changes that took place. She will talk with Katie about her experiences and her desire to be a child again. Karen never had a lot of friends growing up and the chance to be part of this group will be too much to resist. By thanksgiving Karen will be your newest friend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so what&#39;s the bad news then,&quot; Mika asked. &quot;Beside our teacher being our friend that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately an object this powerful attracts people who crave its power,&quot; he said. &quot;The boy who took the ring is beginning to look for the ring if he finds it he&#39;s going to try and take it. If he gets the ring he&#39;s going to use it to change people in order to have sex with them, I&#39;ve seen the timeline where he kept the ring, trust me has A LOT of sex and the way he does it he forces them to have sex with him. He will eventually pervert the power further by using it kill and conquer.&quot;<br />
Y <br />
&quot;So how do we stop him,&quot; Mary asked. &quot;Glad you asked Mary,&quot; Merlin answered. &quot;All of you were chosen for a reason. You loved your youth and want to return to innocence. I am willing to give each of you an item of transformation that you may choose from my store. I only ask that one of you become my apprentice instead of taking an item and that you purchase something at a later time, I am running a business after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we could do that,&quot; Sammy said. &quot;Is there anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded his head and gazed at the girls. &quot;Just one last bit of advise. I can protect you if you are willing to give up you adulthood and the power of the ring. I have the power to resurrect all of your parents so that you can grow up all over again. This will mean you would lose all of the knowledge you have gained and become children body and soul. Essentially you would start from scratch, but you would still have each other. I recommend this option, you only have a 50/50 chance of success even with my magic items. Whatever you do though you need to get Katie first.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls looked at each other and pondered a decision that would affect them for the rest of their lives.</p>
