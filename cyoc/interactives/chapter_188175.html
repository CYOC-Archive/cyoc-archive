<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tamantha was a clumsy girl. A low brain compatibility had left her ability to control her body hampered leaving the girl to occasionally trip or slur a word or two. However she seemed to be a healthy girl in all other respects. While there was a lot of things Tamantha ended up enjoying that Tom liked they seemed to be two separate individuals. Tom was dead long live Tamantha as it seemed much to Alice&#39;s displeasure. His son Matt who had complicated feelings to begin with didn&#39;t take the news well either. <br />
Tamantha&#39;s mother Gloria was wondering whether or not Tamantha&#39;s Tomboyishness was a side effect or not, but noted as Tamantha developed and aged she was getting less clumsy. As she got into her teens she tried crossdressing a bit which her physique helped a little out with since she was less curvy with just an A-cup so far, and was tall and had a relatively deep voice for a girl her age. This then led to the moment where Tamantha being part of the drama club was doing something on the edge of the stage... and then her brain spasmed a bit with incompatibility like it hadn&#39;t done in over a year which caused her to fall of stage... and while she didn&#39;t hit her head that hard since her body took most of the impact her brain did get a small knock.<br />
Gloria and her husband could afford a real nice private school so when Tamantha woke up it looked like she was in a real hospital room. However there was the school nurse... <br />
&quot;Umm... Pardon me...&quot; Tamantha said weakly &quot;Where&#39;s Alice?&quot; <br />
The nurse turned and said &quot;Alice? If you&#39;re talking about the girl who brought you in... She&#39;s probably back on stage at that Drama Club.&quot; <br />
&quot;Huh? but why the operation doesn&#39;t take that long does it?&quot; Tamantha asked<br />
&quot;Operation? You just hit your head a little. We were just letting you rest.&quot; Tamantha looked perplexed for a second. <br />
&quot;Just so we&#39;re clear. I&#39;m Tom, I was dying of cancer, and had to get a brain scan with someone brain dead...&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure you are... Well you seem good enough to get back to your play.&quot; The bell rang &quot;Or... whatever your next period class is going to be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; <br />
&quot;Not the time for you&#39;re acting. If you&#39;re healthy enough to act you can get out for class.&quot; The nurse helped Tom up and handed Tom her purse. Being reintroduced into the world 16 years later in an unknown form Tom was confused as he seemed to apparently be in some high school... As some random girl it seemed like... Was he dead?!? Is this what hell looked like?!? Not knowing where her next class was much less who she was right now Tom kinda got taken to the principal&#39;s office. <br />
&quot;I just got a brain scan, I don&#39;t know who this girl is...&quot; Tom tried to explain to the principal. Presuming that Tom was permanently in this body she didn&#39;t figure the girl she used to be would care if her privacy was violated by the new person in the steering wheel... to find that she didn&#39;t have a phone in her purse, and her wallet just had a little bit of money and what looked like an emergency credit card... Nothing really to figure out who she was. Tom wasn&#39;t taken very seriously and just told where to go, but when the girl who wasn&#39;t that great in her math entered in the middle of the test and then finished the test in less than 10 minutes, and the Teacher checked that she had gotten everything right. Well the potential idea that she may not have been the same person was a bit more credible. Getting Gloria to come over was simple enough since she was called to be let known her daughter&#39;s situation two times that day. <br />
Gloria said &quot;So yes... This probably should be on her record somewhere, but when she was born Tamantha was essentially brain dead so we did an experimental procedure to brain scan a low compatibility scan on her. Either saving the person on the brain scan or giving our baby a working brain... For awhile it looked like Tamantha was just Tamantha...&quot; There was a tear or two that came out of  Gloria&#39;s eyes now and then. Sure Tamantha was weird, but... well she was her daughter, and now with Tom&#39;s reintroduction... it seemed like Tamantha was effectively dead.  <br />
<br />
From how things were looking like Tom would have most of her rights minus being able to touch a bottle of liquor for five years... or smoke for 2 years she supposed although Tom never smoked. Tom sitting with Gloria felt awkward since in a way he did kinda kill Gloria&#39;s kid in a way. <br />
Tom sighed and asked &quot;So know anything about what happened to Alice?&quot; <br />
Gloria nodded and said &quot;She&#39;s still a tutor. On occasion she&#39;d come over to tutor Tamantha...&quot; <br />
&quot;Great&quot; Tom thought &quot;I&#39;ll at least get to see if she kept anything of mine...&quot; The issue is that there were way too many questions, and so much uncertainty for how much of her life Tom still had... he&#39;d been not working for 16 years and who knows how much the industry had changed...</p>
