<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both elders woke up and ate breakfast in relative silence. They shared the normal pleasantries but a heavy air had fallen in the apartment. <br />
<br />
Neither of them talked about the unexplained changes to their bodies. Neither could explain the way their bodies seemed to have changed over the course of yesterday afternoon. Both feared that if they showed what was going on under their temple garments that the other would think they were living with a freak. They were friendly but they weren&#39;t friends. They worked together in the mission field but they didn&#39;t have the open relationship that would have made it possible to speak openly about what was going on and ask for help. <br />
<br />
Instead, they sat in silence and then started out in their bikes. Going to the first house on their list, that nice man named Chuck who had spent so much time with them the day before. <br />
<br />
They were both scared, they were both uncomfortable but they both had a job to do and the other Elder to keep from being suspicious. <br />
<br />
They pulled up to the address they remembered but they couldn&#39;t quite remember the house they had arrived at. It was different yet familiar. <br />
<br />
They hadn&#39;t realized that the rundown and neglected two-story home from the day before was now a three-story manicured McMansion. <br />
<br />
They parked their bikes near the front door and Elder Aaron rang the doorbell. Chuck opened the door but he was no longer the slovenly dressed man that he they had had such a nice time talking to yesterday afternoon. He was cleanly shaven, lightly tanned and wearing a fitted grey suit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boys, come on in!&quot; Chuck said with a wide grin. <br />
<br />
Elder Aaron and Elder Wyatt stepped through the threshold and stood by the couch. <br />
<br />
Chuck went and sat in a nice chair in the finely appointed front room and motioned to the couch. <br />
<br />
The Elders walked over to the couch. They stood their, pamphlets and books in their hands when they barely noticed Chuck reach over and grab a laptop and press a key. <br />
<br />
Simultaneously Elder Aaron and Elder Wyatt realized they couldn&#39;t move anything below their shoulders. <br />
<br />
Then, before they could look down and notice it, they felt it. They were naked, their bodies still stock still. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on!&quot; Both boys screamed in unison. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now boys, that&#39;s not the well mannered behavior you showed me yesterday Chuck said with a gleaming white grin. He clicked another key and the boys remembered the changes he had made, the way he had undressed them with that device, the way he had changed them without them knowing it. <br />
<br />
Both boys blushed red at the knowledge that this lecherous man had been so cruel to them. They remembered his lingering glances and the way he had chuckled to himself as he had manipulated their bodies without their permission. <br />
<br />
Chuck ignored their discomfort and clicked another button. Two large mirrors appeared in front of them. <br />
<br />
There they stood, their bodies changed from neck to mid thigh. Each looked at the other, Wyatt seeing the hairy body of Aaron, his jutting nips and his drooping, fleshy cock. He licked his lips without thinking. <br />
<br />
Arron saw Wyatt, his pierced and tattooed body a swirl of color and words. Then his eyes shifted back to himself and the changes that had been made. He blushed again as his cock hardened at the sight of his own hirsute frame. <br />
<br />
Chuck made a slight cough. Drawing both boys attention to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a proposal for you two.&quot; Chuck said stonily. &quot;You religious folks always talk a big game about loving thy neighbor, and turning the other cheek, and whatnot. Frankly, it&#39;s really annoying. I&#39;ve been given immense power, power to change the world as I see fit. I want to see what you boys decide to do when really tested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arron and Wyatt blanched. Both would have shivered under the hungry gaze and callous words of the evil man before them if either had control of their bodies but instead they said nothing. <br />
<br />
Chuck continued, &quot;So, I&#39;ll give you a choice. If you want, I&#39;ll let you both go on as you look now, with no further changes. But, if you want, I&#39;ll undo everything I&#39;ve done.&quot;<br />
<br />
The missionaries eyes widened. This guy was a madman. He was crazy to think they would keep what he had done to them. The way he had defiled their bodies, made them different, made them freakish. <br />
<br />
&quot;But, there&#39;s a catch,&quot; Chuck said, his grin widening, &quot;If you decide you want to me to undo your changes, I will, but I&#39;ll do much much more to the other of you. I&#39;ll give you a few seconds to decide.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elder Aaron and Elder Wyatt stared daggers at the man.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d never do that!&quot; Aaron said. His voice cracking a bit as he proclaimed his fidelity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Wyatt said, his voice shaky. &quot;Is there more you can change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Chuck said, actually surprised at the response of his victim.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you change more than my appearance?&quot; Wyatt said, his voice becoming stronger.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Elder Wyatt, what are you doing?&quot; Aaron said looking at him through the mirror.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I hate my life.  I hate being on mission.  I hate that after this is all done I&#39;ll have to go back and live with my parents and all my brothers and sisters or go to BYU and do four more years of all this crap because it&#39;s the only college my parents will pay for.  I hate it all.  I&#39;m trapped.  I&#39;m miserable.   My whole life has been planned out for me and decided for me and I&#39;m sick of it.  Hell, I hate that all of that ended up with me here, looking like a freak.  I also hate that I&#39;m even saying all this but if this is my way to have a different life, or even a happy life, I&#39;ll take it. I want to have fun.  I want to make my own choices.  I want to be able to like who I like even if that&#39;s you Aaron.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words had risen out of his chest like vomit.  Wyatt hadn&#39;t wanted to say all that. He never thought he would have said something like that before in his life but having your body completely changed and being stripped naked in front of a creepy stranger and one of your only friends could make a person surprisingly vulnerable. Wyatt stood there panting, his face and body flushed in red blotches of embarrassment  in the way that only truly pale people could.  A tear ran down his cheek.  <br />
<br />
Chuck&#39;s jaw dropped at the revelation.  He hadn&#39;t expected the boy to have been able to move him but, the pure misery in his voice was real. It was misery over a life as manipulated as he had manipulated others, except more insidious because it wasn&#39;t done by the click of the mouse or the tap of the key to fulfill a fantasy, it was done by society. Society that crushed what was different and took away choices not by force, but by demand and denial.  <br />
<br />
Chuck made a decision as gave Wyatt control of his body again. He removed the tattoos and piercings from the boy and left him as he had been the afternoon before.  Wyatt wiped his tear away and covered himself standing there.   <br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s eyes widened and Chuck thought for a moment that he was going to hear another heartrending revelation but when Aaron spoke, he did so with bile and hate.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you&#39;re a perverted faggot like him.&quot; He barked.  <br />
<br />
The shock Chuck felt was compounded by the hurt that passed across Wyatt&#39;s face, his shoulders slumping.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea.&quot; Chuck said, and then he once again paused both of the boys and started rewriting their lives a second time.</p>
