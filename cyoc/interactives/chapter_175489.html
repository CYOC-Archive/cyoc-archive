<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The road of William Tarr&#39;s marriage to Candace was not a short one. First of all, she had to make the first move, taking advantage of Leap Day&#39;s tradition of letting women propose to the men they want to marry. It wasn&#39;t that William was unwilling, though he had to think it over for some time. The main reason their wedding got put off for so long was the COVID-19 pandemic. It was very hard to plan a wedding considering there was a contagious and dangerous virus on the loose. Not that they wanted a big wedding, but they didn&#39;t want to just elope and be done with it. William still has his family and they&#39;d be a lot less likely to forgive him for not inviting him to the wedding than for him changing his species.<br />
<br />
Politics were also a source of delays for the wedding. Texas was an unusual hotbed for voting dissonance this year. Traditionally a red state, Texas did have a pretty large amount of Democrat residents and there have been many tricks to keep people from certain districts from voting. Though with mail-in voting, Democrats were finally able to get their voices heard. And Dinosaur City had to help their neighboring city of Glen Rose with getting things organized for elections. Fortunately, William Tarr&#39;s position of mayor was never in jeopardy. He was doing such a good job and the task looked so burdensome, that no one wanted to run against him. Though there were a few joking write-in votes for various theropod Animalians who people would make a cooler mayor than a simple human. Though William won&#39;t be human much longer after the wedding.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It ended up being a pretty small wedding. It was held out in a venue that was closer to where William&#39;s sister lived. There weren&#39;t a whole lot of people, namely relatives of the groom and friends of the bride. Though considering the limitations involved in social distancing, it was a pretty big gathering. Though everyone could agree that Candace looked lovely as a bride. Her blue scales complimented her white dress very well and her veil was draped nicely over her horn. William looked a little nondescript next to her, not to mention pretty small. But the brides are the center of attention at weddings after all.<br />
<br />
The vow exchange was rather memorable as well. As William held Candace&#39;s hands, he said, &quot;When I first moved to my small house on the outskirts of Glen Rose, I never would have expected a city to grow up around me, let alone one populated by dinosaurs. And I never would have expected a woman to take such interest in me, let alone someone as amazing as you. I&#39;m not sure if I really did anything to deserve the good fortune I&#39;ve received. But I do know I&#39;m going cherish it, and I&#39;m going to cherish being with you for the rest of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candace smiled and replied, &quot;I won&#39;t claim that I&#39;ve had complete control of my life. I certainly didn&#39;t choose to have leukemia. But at least I had the choice of what kind of Animalian I became. I used to wonder if I made the right choice in becoming a <i>Parasaurolophus</i> instead of something more modern. But I think I made the right choice then because it eventually led me to you. I can definitely say that I choose to be with you for the rest of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
William and Candace didn&#39;t stay much long after the ceremony was over. There wasn&#39;t really many options for a reception afterwards, considering current health concerns. Besides, they needed to get headed on their honeymoon. It would take them a while longer to get there considering the screening that was involved with Animalia Airlines these days. And Candace was particularly impatient to get to Mieni Atoll so she can finally convert her new husband.<br />
<br />
William hadn&#39;t been expecting to do the bridal carry himself. Candace was obviously too big for him to carry, so she was the one who did the carrying. But he felt less like a new husband that she just married and more like a new toy that she could wait to get out of its packaging. &quot;I sense that you are impatient,&quot; said William after he was dumped on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;After waiting all these months? I have good reason to be,&quot; said Candace before heading to the bathroom, &quot;Take off your clothes, I&#39;ll be ready in a few minutes.&quot; The bathroom wasn&#39;t quite so spacious, the honeymoon suites weren&#39;t built with Dinotopians in mind. But it gave room enough. Candace was glad she decided to wear her lingerie underneath her traveling clothes. She would have whacked herself a bit too much if she was stripping all the way down and putting her lingerie on afterwards.<br />
<br />
Candace walked out of the bathroom, wearing nothing but a bra, panties, garters, and stockings, all sapphire blue to go with her paler blue scales. &quot;Well, husband, are you ready for...&quot; She started with a sultry purr, but trailed off as she tried to keep a straight face. William had stripped, but only down to his underwear. &quot;Are we feeling a little shy?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, don&#39;t want you to laugh,&quot; said William with embarrassment, &quot;Next to you, I&#39;m so...tiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candace didn&#39;t comment on that. She didn&#39;t know if William was particularly under-endowed for a man or he was just small in comparison to her. A wrong response could cause a serious blow to his pride. &quot;Well, fortunately, you won&#39;t remain that small for long,&quot; she said. She unfastened her bra, letting her breasts bounce out. Dinotopian or not, they still served the same function when she was human and she already had herself de-vaccinated. &quot;This will cure what ails you,&quot; she said, cupping one breast.<br />
<br />
William was a little hesitant at first. It felt a little emasculating to be nursing at a breast, no matter what the reason. But once his lips were on the nipple, he didn&#39;t stop. He didn&#39;t expected much flavor from saurian milk, not any that he would really detect. At least it wasn&#39;t bitter or sour. But as he drank, new strength was entering his body. He could feel his muscles growing past whatever size they had been before.<br />
<br />
Candace watched her beloved change before her eyes. As his hair fell out, scales grew in. Unsurprisingly, they were a dark shade of blue than hers. Candace wondered briefly why Dinotopians became the colors that they did. Shouldn&#39;t dinosaurs be in more earthly colors? Was it because a corruption in the fossilized DNA as it was processed by the Animalian virus. Who cares? William was quickly catching up to her size. He hadn&#39;t been a buff man before, but he was now. She placed her hands on his broadening shoulders as she rubbed against him. His briefs were already so tight.<br />
<br />
Candace suddenly remembered her underwear won&#39;t be snapping off and quickly started taking off her panties. She took the time to admire how William&#39;s feet were becoming saurian like hers. And then whether it was the growth of his new tail or his new member becoming too much, William&#39;s briefs torn asunder. Whatever size he was before, he now had a respectable saurian rod now and it probably wasn&#39;t finished growing. Candace rubbed her pussy up against it to get it lubed before plunging herself on it.<br />
<br />
William&#39;s moan had a more sonorous sound. His nose had disappeared into the hadrosaur muzzle that his face had become, but his nostrils were still very present. A crest was growing from his head, which contained extended sinus passages. Candace already knew that a <i>Parasaurolophus</i>&#39;s crest had several functions, including sound amplification. She massaged William&#39;s crest as she bounced harder on his rod. William was finally starting to reciprocate, plunging back with vigor. Eventually, the two of them let out a trumpeting call as they hit climax.<br />
<br />
After that, Candace took the time to admire her new husband. He made a very handsome <i>Parasaurolophus</i>, his dark blue almost matching her lingerie. He was also as fit as any of the other double-dosed Animalians and she liked feeling his new defined muscles. &quot;Was that worth the wait, Mayor Tarr?&quot; she asked coyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than worth it, Mrs. Tarr,&quot; said William as he nuzzled her. They&#39;ll have to figure out how kissing will work later. But they had plenty of time to learn on their honeymoon.</p>
