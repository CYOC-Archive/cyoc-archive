<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike had made his rounds.  Every girl he could find in the dorm was changed in one way or another.  They all ended up with large breasts that strained to be free from tight shirts.  Each one was given a different character trait.  Little decorations that would come out when triggered.  Mike was feeling creative but he had run out of subjects.  It was time to leave.<br />
<br />
Kimmy followed Mike wherever he went.  She slouched in the corner twiddling her magic fingers, making his dreams become true.  Somehow she had thought that it would have been more fun changing people.  Kimmy could vaguely see into Mike's mind so that she could weave the magic to his desire but she found him boring now.  There was little in his head besides thoughts of sex.  Every woman he met would just be one more pair of tits.  One more pretty face dressed to please.  Kimmy was bored.<br />
<br />
If she could she would probably just have wondered away.  Mike still had the Town Curse so he could still have some fun.  She was not shackled to Mike; she had the memory of her whole magical commitment locked in her brain.  The only thing that kept her by his side was that Kimmy was unable to perform magic without his consent.  She was a smart girl; she would figure out how to leave him some how.<br />
<br />
Mike drove the two of them to his house.  He wondered if he should just stay home tonight.  Kimmy was a very attractive woman, especially in her genie get-up.  He really wanted to have sex with anyone and soon.  Despite the fact that his penis was stone, it was still erect and was not going away.  It was still early and there was that party he wanted to go to.  Just a quick shower and a change of clothes.  Then they would be on the way.<br />
<br />
Mike led Kimmy up to his apartment.  It was small place, sparsely furnished.  There was wall of shelves that displayed Mike's media collection.  A large TV was positioned nearby with soft, used arm-chairs crowded around.  In another corner there was Mike's computer and drawing table; some of his unfinished work still out.  Mike offered Kimmy the run of the place while he made his way to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Kimmy perused the shelves trying to make heads or tails of the man she was trailing.  He likes Japan, she thought.  From the covers he seemed to prefer the shows that dealt with sex, violence and big guns.  She was the magical servant to a man that liked guns and boobs bigger than a person's head.  She sighed.<br />
<br />
Sitting in a chair she took a long look at the clothing she wore.  It was sexy and much of it was made of gold cuffs.  She wondered that she was not cold in such a skimpy outfit.  It was fitting, however, to what Mike seemed to think women should be like.  Idly she tried to remove a wrist cuff but found it solidly attached to her body.  No, escape would not be that easy.<br />
<br />
Mike skittered by with a towel around his waist.  Kimmy moved to his art table and started looking over his drawings.  She had never studied art but was certain this was good.  It looked professional grade.  She might actually like it if only the woman depicted wore something other than a vine bikini.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Mike asked as he returned smelling less like melted cheese than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Kimmy said.  &quot;This is what you draw?&quot;  She indicated the cartoonish women.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  There are lots of people on-line that are willing to pay for it.&quot;  Mike pulled open a drawer on a filing cabinet and pulled out a file.  He displayed a wide range of inked papers, each depicted a woman in garish costumes.  &quot;You would not believe some of the stuff people want.  There are some seriously disturbed people out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  Just out there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike looked at his magical genie.  In the glow of the computer screen he could see how the metal bra she wore pushed her abnormally large breasts forward for inspection.  She was judging him, he thought.  &quot;Hey the stuff I did tonight was much less weird than somethings ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Save it.  Where are we going?&quot; Kimmy cut him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;To a house party being thrown by a girl I went to high-school with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it a costume party?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then may I ask for a change of clothing?  Or do you want everyone you know to find out you have a genie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike smiled.  That might not do.  He was not yet sure what he wanted to do but if she was following him there gold underwear might not be fitting.  &quot;I wish you had more normal clothing on.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a flash Kimmy was dressed magically.  She looked down to find she wore a short, blue-plaid shirt that came down to mid-thigh.  Knee-high, white socks were bound to her legs with shiny-black, square-toed shoes with a four inch heal.  Her top was now a white collared shirt complete with a blue tie.  She could still feel the metal bra under her shirt pushing her fantastic breasts into the white cotton.  About her wrists she could feel the gold bracelets were still there but hidden from sight.  Her hair remained pulled back tightly in the long pony tail.  She gave Mike a dis-appointed look.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  You're still technically a school-girl.&quot;</p>
