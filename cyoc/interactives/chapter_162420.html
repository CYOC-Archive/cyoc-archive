<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As afternoon turned to evening, Tom Herald and Harold Stevens made their way out from the Stevens home and began to make their way toward Moon Lake&#39;s City Hall building. Both had the knowledge that things wouldn&#39;t necessarily easy, as Tom&#39;s big reveal plan would change the way weres everywhere would end up operating, and change of that sort of nature was never easy to accept. Tom saw it as necessary and ultimately unavoidable, but that wouldn&#39;t mean that there wouldn&#39;t be those that were afraid of change. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d already seen some of that sort of reaction thanks to the roles that the two Luna Brotherhood played in threatening him after he&#39;d managed to convince Moon Lake&#39;s City Council that the reveal was something worth doing. That was something that frightened him, and why he&#39;d urged he and Alice stay in Moon Lake, with the assumption that the two &quot;secret agents&quot; wouldn&#39;t provoke an open fight in an area where they might not so easily hide. The presence of Ichiro and Yoshiro no Tachibana was assuring, but also marked how potentially turbulent the present times were.<br />
<br />
Things were relatively quiet as the two men walked together with their escorts slightly behind them and in flanking positions as they did so. The sky was already getting dark as the sun went down, bathing the small town in night with the hum of some of the street lights coming on as they night came in. However, as they began to get closer to City Hall, both Tom and Harold could hear some shouts carrying on the wind. It sounded like two groups yelling across a street  and some of it just garbled together to a point where neither could tell what it was. Tom thought he heard the words &quot;free, safe, and lab&quot; being echoed back and fourth by different voices, but it was something that he couldn&#39;t quite make out. It was only as they got closer and began to come more into view of the City Hall building. On one side of the street there was a large crowd waving signs that looked to be more personal attacks against Tom than the issue of the reveal. On the other was another decent sized group that were largely shaking their fists at the other, though they had fewer signs. There were also two police cars parked on either side of the street and with uniformed officers present between both crowds.<br />
<br />
&quot;All part of the argument that&#39;s gone on,&quot; Harold commented off hand, &quot;and will go until your reveal is either rejected or runs its course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said it would be easy,&quot; Tom commented, &quot;and we may be reaching a point where that secret could come out some other way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here Tom&#39;s mind thought on his own actions regarding Lionel Ulysses&#39; arrest and the body came footage that the Seattle Police released. He thought there had been more to it than just a costume piece, and he was right, but as he&#39;d met and fell in love with Alice Stevens, he recognized that the specific method of his investigation wouldn&#39;t help. As he&#39;d even tied too much of his own search into Lionel Ulysses&#39; arrest, which on the surface wouldn&#39;t help weres if his editor hadn&#39;t blocked him. It didn&#39;t change his opinion on the truth or that weres would never be free until they came into the open, but it did change how he was to go about the reveal. Harold only nodded as they kept moving forward.<br />
<br />
Harold nodded, &quot;thankfully it looks like the anti reveal crowd here is a bit smaller than the one that was outside our house the other night... though it&#39;d probably early to figure things out on that front... and with these reveal meetings closed to the public... at least while the plan is being developed... some of that may not change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded again as they moved to cross the street and actually began to approach the crowd that was protesting the reveal. The were mostly shouting things about &quot;keeping weres safe&quot; and shaking their signs at the group across the street. No one charged out at them or at the other group, but it was pretty clear that the group was emotionally hostile. That became even more clear when Tom and Herald began to get closer and the anti-reveal crowd began to notice them. When they recognized Tom, shouts of &quot;traitor&quot; rang out and the group attempted muscle their way in front of Tom and Herald, almost as if to form a sort of wall of bodies and preventing the two from getting in, which given that Tom, a werefox, and Harold, a wereraccoon, not being the largest of weres wouldn&#39;t be able to easily do. They eventually only gave ground when Yoshiro, Ichiro, and one of the uniformed officers came forward. That let them slowly make their way into the building. The one thing that almost made Tom smile was that across the street, Tom swore he could hear someone shout, &quot;let the hero free!&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the building didn&#39;t fully muffle out the sounds of the protests outside, as both groups were intent on being as loud as they could, likely in an attempt to disturb the session. Inside, Tom noticed one line of men in dark suits standing across the empty lobby area. Most of them were Japanese, and were werefoxes, though one was a bit taller and far more heavily muscled, and was a werewolf. All were in their human forms at the present time. This line parted as Tom and Harold approached, letting the two move between them. Yoshiro and Ichiro followed, stopping only to bow to the werefoxes that were there in the line and then resumed their pace behind Tom and Harold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Additional security?&quot; Harold wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Given the present nature of things and that our grandmother is part of the City Council, it is best that the Skulk&#39;s partnership with the Moon Lake PD continue,&quot; Ichiro answered, &quot;our grandmother may wield no political authority beyond her vote... but that wouldn&#39;t mean that someone running on emotion might not try something radical to prove a point...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ichiro and I will escort you to the doors to the council room and will wait outside,&quot; Yoshiro added, &quot;when the meeting is over, we will escort you both out and back to the Stevens residence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom and Herald both walked along and nodded as they climbed up the stairs and followed the path that would take them to the City Council room on the building&#39;s upper floor. Yoshiro and Ichiro did stop and stood to flank the door while Tom and Herald walked in. They entered to find things set up normally with the long table with the places for Moon Lake&#39;s six wards and Deputy Mayor Katherine Chambers. The sign tags for the six ward seats were for a Frank Tarr at Ward One, Mahatma Tambi at Ward Two, Richard Winx at Ward Three, Rosaline Wuhr at Ward Four, Akane no Tachibana at Ward Five, and Harold Stevens at Ward Six. They were all of different weres, some of which Tom recognized, though how he recognized them he didn&#39;t know. There was one additional man that was there and standing in one far corner. He wore a proper suit with a blue tie and what looked like a brass pin that looked like a whale&#39;s tail on his lapel. Tom also caught the mixed scent of fish and men&#39;s cologne on the man as well. The biggest difference was that the podium that was supposed to be before Katherine Chambers&#39; seat wasn&#39;t there and an added chair was brought in before her chair on Tom&#39;s side of the table. Tom slowly approached that chair while Harold moved to sit at his assigned seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust there were no problems?&quot; Katherine Chambers asked as Tom sat down.<br />
<br />
Tom was quiet for a moment, unsure if the question was to him or Harold, as they had come in together and found the rest all waiting for them. It lead to a semi awkward silence before Harold asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No real problem... the protestors outside seemed a bit agitated to have to let us through, but they did part ways... eventually,&quot; Harold spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can anyone blame them?&quot; Frank Tarr questioned, &quot;this fool comes in... proposes something no one in Moon Lake would seriously want outside of a fantasy and some how gets four people to agree with him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There were others that were in favor of the reveal on the other side of the street,&quot; Harold shot back as he looked across the table to Frank&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bigger thing is more on what will HAVE to be done,&quot; Tom spoke up nervously, &quot;whether or not it is wanted is irrelevant to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime,&quot; Katherine Chambers spoke up, &quot;we will come to order and discuss this calmly and rationally... and work together as the legislative body of Moon Lake and with what input and ideas Mr. Herald can provide. So that this plan protects Moon Lake, regardless of its consequences.&quot; There were a few nods of either agreement, or at least acceptance before Katherine turned back to Tom and lifted up a series of papers and offered them to him. She spoke as she handed them to him,  &quot;To start with, Mr. Herald, Moon Lake has had contingency plans over the years to deal with situations where the secret might be revealed. Before we get started on anything... I would ask that you read through them and let us know on what you think before moving on from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d also have questions on how you would plan to conduct this reveal,&quot; Mahatma added, &quot;Such as where and how you would do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom nodded and accepted the papers. He calmly looked through them and flipped them to the bottom of the stack as he finished reading the page. The room was rather silent as he looked through the pages and with all eyes on him. He could note that much of it was detailed, explaining were behavior and desires and there were even posted statistics from Moon Lake&#39;s police department that indicated that the percentage of weres that went &quot;rogue&quot; were very low given Moon Lake&#39;s population size and that in nearly every case the were in question went &quot;rogue&quot; for reasons that Tom was fairly sure most normal humans turned to crime or engaged psychopathic actions. Though a lot of it was very general in nature and didn&#39;t get into very many specifics that related to individual were species, and Tom had noted some of those differences, at least with regard to werefoxes and wereraccoons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... to speak to your contingency plan,&quot; Tom spoke as he finished reading, &quot;there is a lot to work with and aside from being very reactive... which this reveal won&#39;t be... there is enough to reword it and use it as the base framework for what will need to be part of the plan. Though, if you&#39;re wishing to protect Moon Lake, some of the statistical information would need to be dropped. It would prove the base point that weres are not the monsters legend has made them out to be, but any good reporter would look at what is presented and the statistical information and would then be curious as to where the statistical information comes from. Personally, I&#39;d find that helpful... but if you&#39;re wishing to protect Moon Lake from negative consequences, that might not be the thing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it is otherwise helpful?&quot; Rosaline wondered.<br />
<br />
To that Tom nodded, &quot;as a starting point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And as said earlier... could you provide some context on how this reveal of yours would go?&quot; Katherine spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would think in stages,&quot; Tom said slowly, &quot;and through my paper... the Seattle Times. Our circulation isn&#39;t as big as say the Washington Post or the New York Times, and because it is print media, I won&#39;t have access to something that could allow for a quick reveal on live television... but it would provide for a more controlled setting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how might this work?&quot; Frank asked, &quot;fictional stories were originally posted in newspapers. That&#39;s how many people first read the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. How would a printed story in a news paper page work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By playing to technology,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;the paper does have an online page, that in theory could show the online version of the paper. But because it&#39;s a web source, it can also show video and audio material as well. It won&#39;t be as much as the main part of the paper, in order to preserve the circulation... but it is there and I do know the guy who runs the paper&#39;s web page. I&#39;m fairly confident I could get him to let me put in a short announcement video on the paper&#39;s webpage... call it an editorial if you will. From there, I can transform on screen and on camera... that will then go online and people will see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And suppose they think this to be some kind of trick?&quot; Akane asked carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s possible... and there may some question on the authenticity,&quot; Tom admitted, &quot;but that&#39;s why this would only be stage one. Once the video would be confirmed to be genuine, the paper and its readers will know its real and any following printed story would be believable. And if need be the paper can then sell the story to the Associated Press which would then spread the circulation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask... why you?&quot; Harold asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The deal we agreed to was that Moon Lake as a were sanctuary would be protected and that the only thing that would be revealed is the existence of weres,&quot; Tom spoke, &quot;if this were to be done in Moon Lake... or with someone from Moon Lake, your town would risk being exposed. I... however... I live in Seattle and have no blood connections to Moon Lake. Thus if it&#39;s me and the response proves negative... I&#39;d be the only one they&#39;d know for sure where a were lives. Moon Lake would be safe... And besides, my idea... my risk.&quot; Harold turned his gaze to Katherine and then over to the man who&#39;d stayed quiet in the back corner of the room. &quot;And would show that I would honor my promise and my word that I would do what I can to assure that your town&#39;s safety is not lost in this reveal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would sound acceptable,&quot; Katherine said slowly, &quot;a show of hands for support?&quot;<br />
<br />
Only Akane and Harold didn&#39;t raise their hands to it. This was likely in relation to Alice Stevens. Akane because as a werefox who had lost her mate, she knew the pain of losing her mate. Harold didn&#39;t because Alice was his daughter and he didn&#39;t want to see his baby girl cry. He could understand Tom&#39;s logic and the fact that Katherine had made him make some pretty firm promises regarding the reveal, but that didn&#39;t change his thoughts for his daughter&#39;s happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;And where would things go from this announcement?&quot; Frank asked with narrowed eyes, but with a much less confrontational tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Essentially the news cycle,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;I would include the advertisement that more would come in the coming days dealing with the reveal. With the video unable to be refuted and genuine, people will be curious and the written report telling the truth of weres and their strengths, weaknesses, and how what makes weres good and noble is bigger than what people may otherwise fear. People will want to know that and my paper would then trust the story... particularly as it could drive up circulation for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might still leave a media circus,&quot; Richard warned, &quot;even if the results are good... it&#39;d be a circus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m well aware of that,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;the news is often a circus... particularly these days when so many outlets are so diverse that you may have more opinion pieces than factual ones... but that circus has always been there. And for some time... I&#39;ve been a part of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Occasionally jumping at sensationalist stories!&quot; Frank pointed out, &quot;I&#39;ve looked onto Facebook and some of your coworkers&#39; posts there... a good many of them, particularly among the secretarial staff, editors, and corporate leaders... let&#39;s just say they find you a bit jumpy, to put it politely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will admit to coming onto things that wouldn&#39;t seem &quot;normal&quot; on the surface and wanting to dig deeper based on it...&quot; Tom admitted, &quot;which can make for a good reporter... and admittedly, when I first started, I got a bit excited over things and wanting to make it big with regards to a story... which can be something that would lead to a bad reporter if it continues. But, I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;ve mellowed with age and matured as well... and have put together the drive for truth that would make for a good reporter. Regardless, the present issue is one that goes beyond what my coworkers say about me on Facebook. And playing to that is merely a distraction... trying to silence the debate with accusations against my character and ignoring the central issue that you&#39;ve already had some close scares regarding the secret... and technology is growing more efficient by the day. This secret can&#39;t last forever, Mr. Tarr. Calling me crazy won&#39;t make it so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better to get it done while WE control the narrative,&quot; Akane spoke with a nod, &quot;least something like the arrest of Lionel Ulysses or the battle with Dymixious Drake happens again somewhere else and things either can&#39;t be covered up or we aren&#39;t as lucky as we have been in the past.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank backed down after that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you really think that this reveal will go positively?&quot; Richard asked to Tom, as things calmed down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as its not connected to a crime and in a position where we can get the information out, have it trusted, and explain the facts and why weres have hidden for years,&quot; Tom answered, &quot;and I would be more than willing to take the first step... if things go well, weres can work toward a future where they can live freely... and if not, they&#39;d get me first and Moon Lake would still be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that will sound acceptable,&quot; Katherine said slowly, &quot;though... I would have one question... why? Why would you be so interested in the reveal of weres and willing to abide by what Moon Lake would require of you? I mean... you may have good reasons for this reveal. Reasons that many of us have never given real thought on before... but as you&#39;ve said, you&#39;re from Seattle. Technically, you&#39;re not under our jurisdiction. You could have revealed weres on your own... for good for bad... so...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why involve you?&quot; Tom asked, &quot;because right now... I only have certain bits of the truth and I am still learning... and at the same time it is the honorable thing to do. If I knew of other were communities... I would do what I could to involve them in these negotiations as well... Largely in the hopes of not surprising them with this... but Moon Lake is the only were community that I know of. And while I will stand by my positions on the truth as a point of honor... that doesn&#39;t mean that I would wish you and your opinions to be ignored.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that IS honorable,&quot; Mahatma spoke calmly, to which the others nodded.</p>
