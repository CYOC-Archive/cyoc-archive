<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The van snaked its way through the New England countryside before arriving at a private industrial looking airport that Clair didn&#39;t recognize.  Though the runway was paved even if it could have used a new resurfacing job, the parking lot and the drive leading to it were gravel.  The van pulled up to a large hanger that had a small white simple concrete block building connected to it and honked the horn.  After waiting for a few seconds, the garage door to the side of the hangar opened up and the van went inside and parked.  After parking and turning off the engine, the male orderly unlocked the van doors and simply got out of the car to do other things without ever saying goodbye or why he left.  The other male orderly in the back got out of his seat, opened the van door and then said his goodbyes before heading off into the unknown.  That left just Clair and the female orderly.  Clair tried to get out of her seat and undo the crotch buckle, but there was no button to press leaving her trapped.  &quot;No, no no, sugarplum, that&#39;s not for babies to do.&quot;, said the orderly as he held up a white plastic key that she then proceeded to insert into the buckle to open it.  She then motioned to Clair that it was time to step out of the van and so, the two stepped out.  Once stepping out of the van, the orderly stopped Clair from going any further.  &quot;I need to put on your backpack harness and check your diaper&quot;, said the orderly.  &quot;But my diaper&#39;s dry!&quot;, replied Clair.  &quot;I know, but I need to check to make sure anyway.  You aren&#39;t capable of knowing to tell me when your diaper needs to be changed.&quot;, the orderly returned before lifting up Clair&#39;s skirt and pulling back the top waistband of her diaper to peek down into the diaper at Clair&#39;s butt to see if she was still clean.  The nurse then proceeded to place Clair&#39;s backpack back onto the boy-girl before buckling the straps just below her breasts.  Now, being hooked into both toddler leashes, the boy-girl was shepherded through two locking steel doors with an airlock in between.  Once inside the building, Clair was led down a depressing short hallway with multiple steel doors, concrete block walls painted a cream color, a cement floor, and a low ceiling with commercial flat light fixtures and commercial ceiling tiles.  After being led down to the last room on the left, the female orderly swiped her badge and led her charge in.  &quot;We&#39;re going to be here for a short while&quot;, said the orderly before she removed both Clair&#39;s wrist leash and her backpack leash.  The room was just as depressing as the rest of the airport.  It had the same lighting, flooring, walls, and ceiling as the halls and had no window or clock to look at.  At forty nine square feet, it was also tiny.  But, It did have a hospital youth crib with a cage top where Clair could at least take a nap and a play rug on the floor in a pond motif with smiling ducks, butterflies, bees and fish.  There was also a low shelf with a large ring stacker, large mega blocks, a couple of bead mazes, a couple of dolls, an articulating plastic smiling lion, a toy record player that was actually a music box with all of its plastic records, and a few picture books that didn&#39;t have any words printed on them.  Feeling depressed, Clair just opted to go to sleep and so she asked the orderly if she could sleep in the crib.  And so, the orderly simply lowered the crib railing, lifted Clair into the crib, and then lifted the railing up again trapping the poor boy-girl inside.  Afterwards, the orderly turned off the lights with a remote control and turned on a nightlight that started playing a lulaby from a music box and projecting stars, planets, and a moon onto the ceiling.  Clair would have enjoyed a pillow or a blanket, but this crib did not have one and so she turned on her back to watch the show happening on the ceiling before drifting off to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clair, Clair!  Wake up, honey.  Nummies time is here!!&quot;, nudged the orderly waking Clair up.  Clair slowly stirred until she became aware that she was no longer in the place she fell asleep in.  She found herself in an over sized stroller that was jostling and moving.....but she wasn&#39;t going anywhere.  Instead, the stroller was firmly strapped to the floor.  She looked around her and found that again, she was in a really small room with no window.  This room was just big enough to seat her and her orderly in and still have some decent leg room.  Someone knocked on the door and slid it open.  &quot;Here&#39;s your food, ma&#39;am.&quot;, an older portly gentleman said before passing a sky blue silicone toddler plate that was divided into three compartments to the orderly who then placed it onto Clair&#39;s stroller tray and making sure the suction cup on the plate was firmly pressed onto the tray so that it could not be easily removed or fall.  Then Clair had received from the portly man a juice box which the orderly placed the straw in before passing it onto Clair and finally a fork and a spoon.  The fork&#39;s tines were blunt and rounded while the spoon&#39;s bowl was wider than usual.  Both handles had a sky blue silicone covering on it which was thicker than a usual utensil set.  Inside the toddler plate which Clair was given was spaghetti and meatballs, sliced carrots and celery and sliced apples, grapes, and blue berries.  The orderly had beef stew with vegetables in a throw away aluminum container and a bottle of water.  Clearly, in Clair&#39;s mind anyway, Clair had the better meal.  And so the boy-girl tucked into her meal grateful that she got to eat at least once today.  The fruit punch juice box was amazing.  After the meal was finished and the portly man came back to collect the trash, toddler plate, and utensils, the orderly gave Clair a coloring book and crayons to use until the plane landed.  The coloring book had simple pictures to color, but had no words on it what-so-ever.  Clair didn&#39;t notice or care though.  She was so bored that she took to it right away.  She had no clue that the coloring book was manufactured particularly for the experiment and for her &quot;age&quot; group.  Toddlers don&#39;t know how to read and so letters in a book were useless and therefore omitted.  And so the boy-girl happily colored in the kitties and bunnies and smiling suns....similar to the sun on her diaper and age patch until the plane landed at its destination and pulled into the hangar.  Inside the hangar, a bus with frosted windows that let light in but wouldn&#39;t allow her to see out, was waiting for her.  The orderly got up out of her seat, lifted it up and out of the way, undid the straps holding Clair&#39;s stroller to the floor, and wheeled her out of the plane, down a ramp, and  towards the waiting van.  This van was more like a bus and so the driver, who could not be seen due to the dark tinted windows and being in a separate compartment from the passengers, opened the side door and let the ramp down to allow the orderly to push the stroller onto the bus to strap it in.  The ramp then folded back in and the door closed by itself.  Behind Clair&#39;s stroller was one seat behind her where the orderly sat and another seat beside that one with two new male orderlies sitting in it.  The bus started moving as Clair was once again handed her coloring book and crayons by her orderly.  A long while later, the bus came to a stop.  Clair was wheeled off the bus into what looked like a clean, but sterile looking indoor parking garage with no windows.  She was wheeled through another airlock with two locking metal doors and into a hallway that looked much nicer than at the airport.  She had finally arrived at the medical center of her new home where she would begin her new life mentally transitioning from a twelve year old boy named Josh to an eighteen month old toddler girl named Clair with the help of a few surgical procedures to make the transition easier.  But first.....she needed to be examined by both a psychiatrist and a general practitioner and samples taken by a phlebotomist and a urologist.</p>
