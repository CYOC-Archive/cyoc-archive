<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle couldn't understand why he felt so good. He should be pissed at Jennifer for messing with his life like she did, but the fact was he was really enjoying his new
<br>
 attractions. He had never been so proud of his body and how he looked before. It was refreshing to feel so uninhibited and want to show everyone who he truly
<br>
 was inside and out. His newly aquired wardrobe could not help but scream 'Look at me, Aren't I fabulous!&quot; And Kyle knew it and was reveling in it. His tight
<br>
 constricting jeans and loud flamboyant shirt said he was sexy and as he climbed on the school bus with a cross between a skip and a hop, his wrist flapped
<br>
 carelessly in the air. 
<br>

<br>
 As Kyle found his way to a seat near the end of the bus, he heard sneers and comments from his peers. &quot;What a flamer... Fag... Queer...&quot; Kyle didn't care. He was
<br>
 in his own personal state of uphoria, and what others thought didn't really matter. He knew he was The Bomb. 
<br>

<br>
 Russell Malone watched that prissboy kid Kyle-something float his way onboard the bus with loathing and disgust. Russ hated faggots &quot;What is wrong with that
<br>
 pervert?!&quot; he said to his buddy Jeff Simpson. &quot;Doesn't he know any better than to act like a queer? What do you say we teach him what it's like to be a real man?&quot;
<br>
 Jeff only answered back with an evil and highly expectant grin. 
<br>

<br>
 After the bus stopped at the school, Russ and Jeff followed Kyle to his locker. The whole time they were taunting him. Sissy-Boy! Queen! Flame! Russ kept
<br>
 stepping on the back of his shoes trying to trip him or make his shoe fall off. Jeff kept shoving his back trying to throw him off balance. Kyle tried to ignore this
<br>
 abuse, but his emotions finally got the better of him and he started to sob. When his shoe finally did come loose, he was forced to stop and try and put it back on.
<br>
 Russ and Jeff would have none of that as they pushed him into a set of lockers. Jeff pushed one way, then Russ pushed the other. The little gay boy was floundering
<br>
 around the highscool hallway like a little rag doll. Why are they so mean to me, Kyle thought to himself. He just couldn't understand. &quot;Leave me alone&quot; he said. &quot;No
<br>
 way,&quot; Russ shouted &quot;not until we show you how a man is supposed to act!&quot; &quot;Yeah, you pussy boy&quot; Jeff said &quot;Pussy boy... Pussy boy...&quot; Jeff kept repeating. Tears
<br>
 were now flowing from Kyles eyes smearing his mascara as they kept at him for the next few minutes. &quot;Look at this fag, his make up is running all over his face.
<br>
 You look like a bitch do you know that?&quot; Russ exlaimed &quot;Is that what you want to look like? A bitch?&quot; Then Jeff chimed in again &quot;Yeah, pussy boy is it?&quot; Suddenly
<br>
 Kyle remembered the power he currently held over these two bullies and as he braced himself against the lockers he asked the same question to both Russell and
<br>
 Jeff. &quot;Transform or Dare you bastards!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Jeff just froze. He knew the story well, and he believed it, he had seen what it had done to his grandfather. Russ on the other hand said, &quot;What are you talking
<br>
 about you friggin bitch boy?&quot; Jeff tried to warn him, but Russ would have none of it. I ain't playin no games here, this little prick needs to learn a lesson about what
<br>
 a real man is all about. Between subsiding sobs, Kyle said, &quot;umm... sniff... Y-you are t-the ones who need the lesson, T-Transform or Dare. Now Choose&quot; Now,
<br>
 out of his own fear, Jeff chose Transform. 
<br>
 But Russ did not choose anything. Jeff started to back away from Kyle and the menacing Russ as Kyle got to his feet. Kyle then said &quot;I am not a Pussy-boy, I have
<br>
 a cock and balls between my legs that I'm damn proud of, but you however since that seems to be your favorite expression will be. Your cock and balls will
<br>
 transform into a pussy of your very own.&quot; Jeff instantly felt a stirring in his crotch, and grabbing himself in a panic fell backward with his eyes wide open in shock.
<br>
 &quot;No, No No No No....!&quot; was all he could say. Russ just stared at his friend and said &quot;You've got to be kidding.&quot; Kyle, now much braver said &quot;Oh no, this is no
<br>
 joke, and since you didn't choose, you get both.&quot; What are you talking about?&quot; Russ said with an amused look of confusion on his face. &quot;You, said Kyle, will get to
<br>
 know what it's like to be a woman, I'm gonna show you what a real bitch looks like. Transform to grow female breasts, a smooth feminine pitched voice to replace
<br>
 your deep post adolecent one, and your face and body grow soft and smooth. Your face will be forever colored with a light shade of blush, bright red lipstick,
<br>
 lavendar eyeshadow, and thick mascara. This coloring is to be permanent and never wash off. You retain your male build and stature, and continue to be provided
<br>
 with your substantial male endowment below the belt. This comes in useful for your dare, as I dare you to fuck your pussy laden pal Jeff, at least once each day.
<br>
 There now you have been taught a lesson too!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Russell just stood there dumbfounded for a moment. Before he even realized the pressure forming on his chest, Kyle gathered himself up, slid his shoe back on his
<br>
 foot, opened his compact to fix his face and walked off to his first class.</p>
