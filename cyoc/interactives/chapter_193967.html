<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Chelsea and Damon left the ass, they didn&#39;t realize one student was grabbing her extra things from behind the teachers desk. Dayna had left a book a few classes ago that she needed to return to the library soon. After just cumming and watching her crush and a new girl go at it, her thoughts were kind of cloudy. So she took extra time and nobody noticed she was still there.<br />
<br />
Damon&#39;s wish didn&#39;t effect her so she still had memories. She remembered watching every thrust as her crush maverick rode the girl. It was almost like a wet dream where she was living out her fantasy while in class. <br />
<br />
She loved how big he felt in her. She loved how his hands gripped her breast,or technically Chelsea&#39;s. It even turned her on feeling his future babies drip out of her after. <br />
<br />
She was getting wet, again? Though she remembered being wet and creaming her panties, after class ended it was as if she cleaned herself up and changed clothes. Her skirt even seemed as if it was ironed this morning by the way it looked.<br />
<br />
Having mavericks number already, she texted him asking how he liked class. She also texted her friend that left ealier seeing how she felt about it. Dayna felt a little jealous knowing she too basically had sex with him.<br />
<br />
But her friend responded as if nothing occured. She just remembered a pretty basic class without any visual examples. Maverick also explained a similar experience.  Was...was she the only one who remembered? <br />
<br />
Maybe that substitute teacher or the new girl had something to do with this? She would just have to hope to see them again,  as she went to the library before getting lunch.<br />
<br />
After dropping off the book, Dayna wanted to find maverick and maybe do some things with him. All she could think about was sex now that she knew how it could be. She grabbed food and sat down at a table. Soon after maverick showed up looking as naturally confident as usual. <br />
<br />
&quot; hey Dayna. Kinda late to be getting food &quot; he said sitting down next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot; I have some stuff to do after class, but I still gotta eat to make it through today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; don&#39;t we all. What was that ealier about class? Was it a little too graphic for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
She blushed slightly but pretended that she was fine. &quot; no, ofcourse not. Just seemed a lil extra for the class. How come you&#39;re bringing it up? Some stuff still on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; uh..no. nothing I didn&#39;t already know. Can I steal a fry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say silly. And maybe. What do I get in return?&quot; She flirted back. She really wanted him to ask her out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhmmm maybe I can meet you after class and I can treat us to some food. They still don&#39;t take card at the kiosk&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; it&#39;s a date hehe. I&#39;ll see you after the bell&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal. I&#39;ll see you in a bit. Don&#39;t keep thinking about health class too much now.&quot; He smiled as he went to class.<br />
<br />
She was ecstatic at being able to finally hang out with him, possibly alone. She just had to finish history and school would be done. <br />
<br />
After class, they met up and continued on thier flirtatious rambling trying to one up each other. She was definitely wet again but didn&#39;t care after this whole day. They went to the mall to grab food and then went back to her house. Her parents worked at night, so she had the house to herself now.<br />
<br />
They sat in the living room watching movies on the big screen with the volume up loud, as usual in her house. You couldn&#39;t really hear anything inside from the outside anyways with thier AC system. <br />
<br />
Eventually they started sitting closer til she put a hand on his thigh and looked up at him. They stared into each other&#39;s eyes before finally kissing.they fell over and began making out as they moved positions. Soon she was getting so horny she pulled off her shirt showing her bra.<br />
<br />
He took that as a sign to take his off too while she went to unfasten his belt. She pulled his pants part down seeing his member poke upwards in his boxers. He then pulled them down freeing it for her to see. It looked so much bigger to her now that she was this close. She lightly gripped it causing him to jolt. Then she released it and stood up on the couch. She turned around and pulled her skirt and panties down in one go. They fell at her feet as she lightly kicked them to the ground.<br />
<br />
She was really going to lose her real virginity to the crush of her dreams! She motioned for him to lean back as she sat above him. She could feel the warmth from his thighs as she moved over his body. Then she again grabbed his member and aimed. She gasped when his member touched her lips,  but she knew she was already wet and this shouldn&#39;t hurt. She leaned down and felt his member push. This was so much. It kept stretching til the head went in and then slid in a few inches. She stopped in pure pleasure.  Fuck, she thought. I didn&#39;t think I would be that wet. He&#39;s almost all the way in.<br />
<br />
Maverick just sat there watching as she slowly went down on him. After a few minutes she finally was sat completely on him smiling as he then put his hands around her hips. She pulled up causing then both to moan and slowly went back down. She kept repeating this just like in class, til she could move faster. Eventually she came riding him and changed positions so he could have a turn. Sex was as amazing as she thought it would be.<br />
<br />
An hour or so later after multiple positions and orgasms, they finally finished. <br />
<br />
This would be a pretty good ending for Dayna and maverick had it not been influenced by magic.<br />
<br />
As Chelsea and Damon were driving back home, she started getting hot again. She thought it was just hormones or some magic from prior, but then she felt it get stronger. She didn&#39;t want to tell Damon yet as it did feel good,but then it got to the point where she was breathing hard. <br />
<br />
&quot; Damon...somethings wrong. I  feel...I feel horny&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I mean I do to after everything but why are you breathing hard?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; I..I don&#39;t...know? I&#39;m not even thinking...about anything yet...but I feel as if..uhhhhmmm&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; chelsea?&quot; Damon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh fuuuuhhhhck....fuck...hmm..yesss....yesss&quot; Chelsea moaned.<br />
<br />
Damon obviously seeing something outside his control panicked and wished them home in his bed.<br />
<br />
He wished her clothes off to see if any physical changes occur. Nope. nothing. He observed her not seeing anything beside her gyrating and arching her back. What could be causing this? He wished her smaller to be able to help control this<br />
<br />
&quot; Chelsea I&#39;m going to wish that you were less horny. &quot; He said and she stopped breathing as hard but still felt something. <br />
<br />
&quot; daamooon. That helped but I still feel it, like...like someone is having sex with meeee!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then Damon thought he messed up. He quickly wished that he would know why she was feeling horny still and was informed he forgot a person who ended up having sex so Chelsea was receiving instead of giving pleasure this time. He realized they were two teenagers from class having a go at it but they were clearly going to finish soon. He waited until she came again and wished Chelsea wouldn&#39;t be connected to anyone and that the girl forget about the class.<br />
<br />
After sex she was so glad it was better than even just feeling it before. Being in control made it feel so much better.  She began to feel a tingling in her head as she compared sex she just had vs the classroom.  But slowly it changed to her assuming how sex would feel vs actually going all the way with her crush. She doesn&#39;t know what made her so confident at school to flirt back at him, but she&#39;s glad they finally did it.<br />
<br />
Little did she know what was to occur even after her memories were erased.</p>
