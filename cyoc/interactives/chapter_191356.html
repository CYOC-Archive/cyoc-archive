<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They met Andrea just as she left the guild. Her chest was as flat as ever. Maybe Alec was a breast kind of guy, because he missed seeing at least something on her.<br />
Alec stomach was telling him something was wrong, even if he couldn&#39;t read Andrea&#39;s face or posture. Hell, he couldn&#39;t even tell if she was impressed by his new duds.<br />
&quot;I see the funds made it to you okay.&quot; <br />
So she did notice. Alec thought.<br />
&quot;Looks good right? Ready for adventure!&quot; <br />
&quot;Quite. So did she tell you about the minotaurs?&quot;<br />
Alec nodded. &quot;Yes, they closed the borders but she didn&#39;t know anything else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, I know a lot of else, just not applicable in this case.&quot;<br />
&quot;Unfortunately I do not have much more to tell you. I have asked around. The minotaurs claim to have been slighted by some humans recently so they closed the borders and paused trade agreements until this gets resolved.&quot;<br />
&quot;So how long would that take? I assume you guys have ambassadors or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. We now have two and a half.&quot;<br />
Alec winced. &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Take it easy Alec. We&#39;ll figure something out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Figure what out? How to invade a...do they have a nation or is it a city?&quot; He stammered as he once again realized how little he actually knew of this world.<br />
&quot;I advise to not do anything rash. I still have some extra queries out that I am waiting on. I hope they will provide us with options and answers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. Fine. So now what? Are we going to sit here and twiddle our thumbs?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, let&#39;s go and arrange some transportation.&quot; Vivian said.<br />
&quot;I shall leave that part to you two. I need to acquire additional magical supplies. I can also have those witch items appraised. While I can check up on some other leads on the way there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to get horses?&quot; Alec asked as they made their way through the city. He could see it now, himself in his shiny new outfit atop a mighty steed.<br />
&quot;Probably. Horses are overrated depending on the situation so I&#39;m still weighing our options.&quot;<br />
&quot;Overrated? I&#39;m sorry, but my experience as a centaur tells me otherwise.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great. My experience as an adventurer tells me otherwise as well. If you leave them to explore a cave you&#39;re very likely to gained loot, but also to have lost your horse when you get back. If you want to do long distances and have a place to keep your eye on them they&#39;re fantastic but we just don&#39;t know what we&#39;re in for yet.&quot;<br />
They visited a few stables to check out the current offerings, fortunately there were plenty to go around at the moment. Alec let Vivian do most of the talking, he was also weighing his options.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day no deals were made quite yet. <br />
They were walking to their next destination when Alec spoke. &quot;So here&#39;s an insane thought. You&#39;re like a rogue class right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Class rogue? I mean I guess, why? Need something stolen?&quot; She said with a wink.<br />
He was half expecting her to have no idea what he was talking about, but to his relief it seemed to mean the same thing here as back in his world.<br />
&quot;So...How stupid would it be to break into the mage guild and get the milk from them?&quot;<br />
He was sure he saw her skip a beat before she answered. &quot;Insanely stupid. Monumentally stupid. Like &#39;you don&#39;t have enough magical punishment and you&#39;d like a second helping&#39; stupid.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean you can&#39;t do it?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m not really that kind of rogue. I&#39;m more of a &#39;I&#39;ll kill you in your sleep&#39; kind of rogue.&quot; she said in a mock scary voice. &quot;I&#39;ll put an arrow in the back of your head while you&#39;re picking flowers kind of rogue.&quot; Firing a mock arrow at his head.<br />
&quot;Besides I like to be on the good side of the mage guild for obvious reasons.&quot; She said gesturing at her still teenage form. &quot;Listen, I get that you want your plumbing fixed, but that&#39;s a terrible idea even for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, okay. I get what you&#39;re saying.&quot; &#39;but I&#39;m not letting that go quite yet.&#39; he added in his mind.  <br />
&quot;And don&#39;t try thinking something you&#39;re not saying. I&#39;m a responsible teen right now, I can recognize stupid ideas when other people have them.&quot;<br />
An awkward silence fell as they walked into the square and Vivian spoke to some people in a caravan.<br />
&quot;So here&#39;s another thought.&quot; Alec said as they walked away. <br />
&quot;You can&#39;t pay me enough for this.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I have a different thought. The honking frogs gave me tits, the balls weed gave me big balls. I have basic pattern recognition. Dick weed will probably grow a dick somewhere if it touches you. Why not just eat some weeds and be done with it?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not quite &#39;I&#39;m going to rob the mage guild stupid&#39;, but it&#39;s quite close. You know nothing of magic, herbs or alchemy. With my limited experience I&#39;d say the most likely outcome would be you get a temporary dick to go with your cunt.&quot;<br />
He winced as she said &#39;cunt&#39;. <br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s my current age, but if you want to experiment I don&#39;t feel like I want to stop you. Maybe converse with Andrea first though, for safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dusk came and with it Vivian guided Alec to a new hotel. It looked nice and all, but really didn&#39;t seem like that much of an upgrade compared to his previous hotel. The outside was mostly identical but with an extra pearly white paint job allowing it to glitter attractively in the setting sun.<br />
The inside was a little larger, but again not amazingly so. It&#39;s main draw was the sheer amount of adventurers that roamed the halls here. Apparently that was it&#39;s primary selling point, lots of adventurers to talk to.<br />
Andrea joined them carrying no news regarding her leads. <br />
<br />
Alec sat down on his bed in his new room. This finally showed a marked difference with the previous hotel. This bed was divine. He dropped on his back and nearly bounced back. Soft and supportive. The walls, the carpets everything was immaculate. <br />
The brightly lit bathroom was at least twice as large as in the previous hotel.<br />
Alec sat pondering about his next step. What was his best course of action. He needed one more ingredient, but it wasn&#39;t easy to get. <br />
He&#39;d thought about it some more, he could try and use Possession to steal it from the mage guild.<br />
But he could try to use his current ingredients to see what would happen or maybe he should just wait till tomorrow and then go out get milk some other way.<br />
