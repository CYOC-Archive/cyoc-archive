<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A crumbled the note landed on the table in front of Mike as he moped at his table. He un-crumbled the ball of paper as he pondered, “Where did this come from?” and began to read.<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so sad, sitting there. Here's a game to make you smile. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
“New friend?” he asked himself again looking around, “What is this some kind of a form to get story ideas? Let’s see here.” Pulling a pen from his hip pocket.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice? <br />
<br />
Mike didn’t even need to think for that one, as he wrote down “Most defiantly! Hand writing is very important” <br />
<br />
“I think I’ll use this to flesh out a character for my creative writing assignment.” Mike mused.<br />
Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
 “Yes but no more then any other color” Mike wrote in a beautiful flowery script. Reading his answer back, he failed to realizing his hand writing changed. <br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly? <br />
“My hair would be straight about mid back in length.”<br />
Mike felt a tickle on the back of his neck and in his scalp as his hair grew in length .But he just ignored it. Thinking it was his mind messing with him.<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color? <br />
“Well since I like red already but let’s throw a small twist on it.” he thought as he jotting down, “Red, because it’s the color of passion, love, and romance.”<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be? <br />
Again he didn’t need to think about it, since he always loved black hair. As he wrote his answer his brown hair darkened to the purest of blacks.<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be? <br />
Mike smiled to himself filling in Emerald Green. His eyes twitched a bit as their color changed.<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like makeup? <br />
“Yes, but in a less is more kind of way. Knowing make-up is meant to enrich natural beauty rather then cover it up.”<br />
He felt something being applied to his face as the sent of perfume filled his nose. “Wha…” Touching is lips he felt a glossy substance but it would come off. As he looked at his fingers his nails became covered in Essie: Flirt nail polish. “Th…this can’t be happening!” he said trying not to draw attention to himself, “I need get out of here!”<br />
As he went to get up, YOU MUST ANSWER EVERY QUESTION, OR ELSE. Appeared in big bold letters. Swallowing hard he sat back down and picked his pen back up. Then a thought hit him, “This is a chance I always wanted. I can see how the other half lives. And if this is happening then I’m going to be beautiful, if I have anything to say about it.” With a small smile he continued.<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty? <br />
Only to the point to keep my amazing figure.<br />
Mike felt his hips flare out, stomach flatten and waist pull in to give an hour glass figure. His legs seemed to lengthen and become graceful as this thighs and butt thickened. His army and hands became graceful, dainty, and elegant. <br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels? <br />
Yes, I love to wear heels. But it really depends on what I’m wearing and the occasion. Today I’m wearing a pair of cute wedges.<br />
He looked down at his feet as they shrank to a woman’s size 6 and his shoes sole grew thicker raising his heels a few inches. The rest of the shoes ripped apart leaving only white straps to hold them on. He took note to his toe nails covered in the same polish.<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt? <br />
Yes, I love wearing skirts and dresses. But they would be just a part of my very large wardrobe. I have a lovely white sun dress on today.<br />
Mike felt his shirt and shorts meld together as the turned bright white and felt as soft as Egyptian cotton. He blushed thinking, “I need to hurry up. I can only imaging how horrible I look right now.” <br />
Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry? <br />
Yes, nothing gudy. A ladies watch or a bracelet, tasteful earrings, and some times a necklace<br />
He felt to studs pierce his ear lobs as a silver lady’s watch formed on his right wrist. <br />
Question 12: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing? <br />
Of course, I’m wearing my pair of very cute glasses. That I look absolutely stunning in.<br />
His glasses morphed into an adorable set of women’s glasses the accentuated his beautiful face.<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be? <br />
I’d have perfect 36 C breasts<br />
Mike inhales sharply as his new breast inflated. He watched it awe as they grow and marveled at the new sensations he was feeling. He smiled at his breast when they stopped growing. “I know already I’m going to be beautiful.” Looking over him/herself so far. “No, I’m going to be more then beautiful. I’m going to be sexy.”<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl... would you be into guys? <br />
Duh! Of course I would be. I want to have a family and children of my own one day.<br />
Looking up Mike noticed all the cute boys in the room and blushed noticing some were longingly looking at her.<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you shave? <br />
Yes, I love caring for my body. I want to look good after all. Besides, who doesn’t love the look and feel of sexy smooth legs and skin? <br />
The tingling feeling creep across her body as her body hair pulled in as if it was never there to begin with. <br />
Question 16: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers? <br />
Thinking for a moment. She wrote, It depends on which I feel like wearing but today I’m wear silken bikini panties.<br />
Her underwear shifted as it hugged her new curves and crushed the last vestige of manhood as they became soft and smooth.<br />
Reading over the next question she giggled to herself and looked down into her lap. “well good-bye little buddy. I’m not sure I’ll miss you.” <br />
Question 17: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons? <br />
Not to sure if there was that big of a difference she just wrote down, tampons.<br />
Mike felt her last man bits squirm as they pulled in and waves of ecstasy washed over her as those bits changed. Biting her lower lip trying not to let the new feelings get to her, “ O, god!,” she thought, “Is this what it will feel like? Yeah I’m not going to miss you at all little buddy.” As the changes stopped and the ecstasy faded something soft slide into her new womanly bits as new memories filled her mind. Releasing her lip she smiled warmly at the new memories and continued the questionnaire <br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall. <br />
Well I’d want to smart and beautiful but not to smart.  So, I guess  8 &frac12;. <br />
No noticeable changes occurred <br />
Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing? <br />
She thought brefly then wrote her answer. “I’d have many kinds to choose from, but they all would be perfectly fitted and comfortable and always matched to my panties.”<br />
Her Grin widened as a silky material slid across her breasts and cupped them. Straps reaching over her shoulders and around her back. Breast lifted slightly and felt very comfortable. <br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?(Don't lie) <br />
I’d be 18 years old (my current age), about 5’5” and would weigh 120 Lb<br />
Mike shivered as her body shrank down to 5’5” and lost several pounds to fit her new weight.<br />
Question 21: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it? <br />
Well I already said it was to my mid back in length. But I’d like it to be cut even at the ends and to have cute bangs. Today it’s hanging free with a little hanging over the front of my shoulders.<br />
The only movement felt was when to locks of hair were pulled over each shoulder.<br />
Question 22: If you were a girl ... what would your name be? <br />
Jasmine Michelle Schmitz<br />
Question 23: If you were a girl ...how would you sound?<br />
 I want my voice to be as sweet and smooth as honey.<br />
Jasmine coughed a few times. Each time becoming higher and sweeter. When the coughing stopped she just had to test out her new voice. “He…hello. I’m Jasmine.” She squealed in delight. Looking back at the page she realized that was the last question as her answers faded from the page. She then read: If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don't matter.<br />
“Yes!” She shouts in her mind as her eyes good wide, “I want to be very happy!”<br />
Jasmine folds the page nicely and leaves the cafeteria. The first locker she came to she slipped the page in through the door vent. With a big bright smile she turned to gladly face he new life.</p>
