<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You know what? I’m in the mood to get a hair cut!” Ty said, while admiring his blond hair in the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
“To be honest with you, I could also use one!” Peter said, while putting the books in his backpack for school for the next day. Peter’s bedroom door was open, so he could see what Ty was doing in the bathroom. <br />
<br />
“Come with me, Peter. We’ve been home studying all afternoon. Why don’t we go to the mall?” Ty asked. Ty then walked into Peter’s room and grabbed Peter’s arm, while wishing for them to be at the shopping mall. In an instant, both Peter and Ty disappeared and re-appeared at the shopping mall. <br />
<br />
The two teens walked up the barber shop and wrote there names on a piece of paper that was on the front counter. When they took their seats in order to wait their turns, they noticed two other guys who were sitting there, who were from the high school newspaper. Peter and Ty joined Bruno and Rex.<br />
<br />
“Hey Bruno, what’s new?” Ty asked, as he took the seat next to Bruno. Rex sat next to Bruno, and Peter took the seat next to Rex.<br />
<br />
“Hey Rex, what’s going on?” Peter asked Rex. Both Rex and Bruno mentioned to Ty and Peter that they were there to have their hair cuts done as well, and that it was such a coincidence that the four of them happened to be there on the same day.<br />
<br />
There was one older lady there, who talked with a very heavy Texan accent. She walked up to Rex and Peter and asked them to take their seats in the chairs first. Then she had Bruno and Ty take their seats, just to the right of Peter and Rex. The lady started working on Ty first, although she was kind of rough on him because she felt like she was a little rushed. So Ty decided to have some fun with her instead. She used her clippers to cut some of Ty’s blond hair, and then she worked on Bruno after a few minutes. While Ty waited for the Texan lady to come back to him with the electric razor, he quietly made his short, blond hair grow back again!<br />
<br />
Another lady finally came over to help, and she started cutting Peter’s hair. When she finished cutting his hair, she continued to work on Rex.  In the meantime, the Texan lady found her razor and walked back to Ty’s chair and started to shave off his hair just above the neck and she trimmed his sideburns. But when she was done, she noticed that Ty’s hair seemed longer.<br />
<br />
“I could have sworn I already cut your hair on top, young man!” she said. She looked at his hair and shook her head for a moment, before she finally grabbed the clippers and started cutting Ty’s hair again!<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Peter saw what Ty was doing and decided to have some fun with it. He looked over and saw in the mirror that Rex was almost finished. While the lady wasn’t looking, he silently wished for Rex’s dark brown hair to grow back again to the original length it was when he walked in to the barber shop! When the lady finally came back with a clean towel in her hand, she was astonished when she noticed that Rex’s hair was even longer than before! <br />
<br />
Both Peter and Ty chuckled at their magical stunts, but Peter telepathically messaged Ty to stop growing the hair back, or else they barbers would charge them twice for the same haircut! Ty agreed and decided to let the hair cutters finish their jobs.<br />
<br />
When all was said and done, the foursome walked up to the cashier and they each paid for their hair cuts. But when they walked out of the barber shop, they decided to evaluate their new looks while looking at their reflections in the windows.<br />
<br />
“Guys, I don’t like my hair cut! How about you?” Peter asked the others.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, I don’t like mine either. What do you think? Whose idea was it to come here in the first place?” Ty asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“It was your idea, Ty! Golly, I could have saved eleven bucks!” Peter replied, while looking at his light brown hair in the window.<br />
<br />
“Next time, I’m just gonna ask Dustin to cut my hair!” Ty wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“I can cut your hair!” Peter responded. <br />
<br />
“So can I, Ty!” Bruno responded, while admiring his own black hair.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we just show our unity and have the same hair style?” Rex asked Peter.<br />
<br />
“I know! We’ll all have Mohawks, but different colors!” Ty said excitedly.<br />
<br />
“Oh great! I knew he was going to say that!” Peter said, while he rolled his eyes upward. And before anyone could say anything else, Ty wished for all four of them to become completely bald except for a straight, narrow line of hair which ran straight down the middle of their heads, from just above the forehead to the back, slightly above the neck. Then Ty made Peter’s light brown Mohawk turn blue, Bruno’s stayed black, Rex’s dark brown Mohawk was now yellow, and his own blond hair turned red!<br />
<br />
“Ack! Ty! I’m gonna kill you!” Bruno shouted, when he looked at his reflection in the window.<br />
<br />
“Holy cow! I look like a freak!” Rex gasped when he saw his reflection as well.<br />
<br />
“In knew this was gonna happen!” Peter said, while staring at his reflection.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry guys! I’ll change you guys back later!” Ty said calmly.<br />
<br />
“Ty! You owe me eleven bucks!” Rex warned Ty.<br />
<br />
“For eleven bucks, I will cut your hair myself, Rex!” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
Then Ty, Peter, Rex and Bruno continued to walk around the shopping mall, laughing at the fact that everybody else was staring at the four teens who were proudly displaying their colorful Mohawks in the mall.</p>
