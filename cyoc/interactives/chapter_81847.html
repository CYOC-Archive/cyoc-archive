<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">George’s family no longer existed.  Myrintha remembered them, just as I remembered my mother, but they didn’t remember George or that he was now Myrintha.  They didn’t even know themselves.  It was time for them to have new identities.  “I know you’re all confused right now,” I said to all three of them.  “But I’m going to remedy that right now.”  They all nodded and waited for me to continue.  “First of all, my name is Chrystalia.  These are my closest friends and advisors, Bozantum and Myrintha.”<br />
 <br />
The woman who had been George’s father interrupted and said, “Those are some weird names.”<br />
 <br />
I didn’t like the sass so I asked sharply, “How do you know?”  She opened her mouth but said nothing.  “Exactly,” I said.  “Now that you know our names, I will tell you what we are.  We are people who are going to change the world.  I have been given an enormous power which will allow me to remake the world as I see fit.  As such, I am going to be the goddess of this new world.  You are all going to join my close circle of advisors.  But I must insist that you refer to me in public as ‘my goddess,’ is that clear?”<br />
 <br />
“Yes,” they all said in unison.  I raised an eyebrow at them to tell them I expected more.  “Yes, my goddess,” they again said in unison.<br />
 <br />
“Very good,” I said.  “I know you are all a little confused right now and don’t remember anything.  That is not going to be a problem.  Just trust and have faith in me and you will be fine.  As for your names…” I turned to George’s mother first.  “You are named Ilithene.  You…” I pointed to the woman who was George’s father, “…are called Plerini.”  I turned to the man who had been Kelly last and said, “And you are Jucodon.”<br />
 <br />
“I like that name,” said Jucodon.  “Sounds tough.” <br />
 <br />
“I thought you’d think that way,” I said.<br />
 <br />
“’Ilithene’ sounds elegant,” said Ilithene with a smile.<br />
 <br />
Plerini looked less impressed.  “I think my name is kind of, like, dumb sounding.  But whatever,” she said.  I had to chuckle on the inside.  I thought it sounded silly.  I considered this another punishment for her past transgressions.<br />
 <br />
“So what do we all do now?” asked Myrintha.<br />
 <br />
“We’re not done forming our inner council,” I said.  “We need a few more people.  Normally, I’d let us all…get acquainted, but we don’t have time right now.  We have to move our base of operations for now.  First, you all need some clothes.”<br />
 <br />
“You don’t have clothes,” snapped Plerini.<br />
 <br />
“I am the goddess,” I said.  “I do not require clothes.”  I wished that Plerini would be slightly less combative.  I didn’t mind being questioned, since that was the point of me forming this group, but not at every single turn.  Especially not over what I considered to be trivial matters.<br />
 <br />
“Oh, OK,” she said promptly. <br />
 <br />
“Since we are all special people, we are allowed to wear special clothing,” I said.  “Like I said, I don’t have to wear clothes.  But as you see Bozantum here, this is all that he requires,” I explained as I gestured to his loincloth.  “That is because we are all exceptional people who have incredible bodies, which are meant to be shown off and admired.  Myrintha, my dear,” I said as I turned to look at her.  I conjured up another image in my head for what I wanted her to wear and wished for it to appear in my hands.  “Here you are, put this on,” I said.  She looked at the garment and gave me a questioning look.  “Just trust me,” I said.<br />
 <br />
The garment was nothing more than a silk nightgown.  But there were many distinctive features.  First, it was completely see through.  Second, there was no way to close or clasp it in any way.  This meant that it would always hang open.  The last distinctive thing about it was that it only extended down to her knees.  When Myrintha put it on, she was barely able to pull it over top of her breasts.  They did end up being covered, but since it was see through, her breasts were still clearly visible.  Since it did not close, the middle of her body, including her belly button and her pussy were fully visible.  She looked at herself with the garment on and then looked at me.  “You’re sure this is acceptable?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
“Absolutely,” I said.  “You look incredible.  Doesn’t she?” I asked everyone else.  They all made sounds of approval.  I turned to Ilithene next.  I wanted something for her that would show off her fabulous ass.  So I thought of a garment that had no back of any kind.  This way her entire back side would be visible.  As for the front, it would look like a strapless one-piece bathing suit.  Her shoulders would be bare and there would be ample cleavage on display.  It would also be partially see-through.  It would conform to her body exactly and it would never slip off thanks to the size of her breasts.  I wished for my creation to appear and I handed it to Ilithene.  She seemed confused as to how to put it on at first, but when she held it out in front of her she got the idea.  It fit her exactly as I’d imagined it would.  “Is it uncomfortable at all?” I asked once she had it on.<br />
 <br />
“Not at all,” she said.  She gave a little twirl and shook her ass a few times for us.  “Do you like that?”  We all whistled in approval. <br />
 <br />
“Simply ravishing,” I said.  Now it was Plerini’s turn.  I decided that her garment shouldn’t be quite as revealing as Myrintha’s and Ilithene’s.  If there was one part of her that should definitely be on display, it was her breasts.  They were pretty spectacular looking even though they looked excessively big on her.  Still, I thought, they were worthy of being on display.  So I conjured up the image of a dress that did not cover anything on her upper body.  It would be nothing more than the bottom of a dress held up by two thin straps that would run outside her breasts.  I did not make it see-through, however.  I wished for it to appear and handed it to Plerini.<br />
 <br />
She put it on without objection.  Once she had it on fully she smiled.  “Well I love how it shows off my tits,” she said.  Everyone laughed at that remark.  Plerini looked upset.  “Like, are you all laughing at me?” she asked.<br />
 <br />
“Not at all, my dear,” I assured her.  “We happen to agree with your assessment.”  She was satisfied with this remark.  All that remained was Jucodon.  His body was almost as perfectly chiseled as that of Bozantum, so I felt his clothing should be similar, yet different.  I considered myself above all others and that’s why I wore nothing.  I considered Bozantum to be above all males now, so no other male should have clothing as sparse as his. <br />
 <br />
I decided that Jucodon would have a loincloth similar to Bozantum.  His would be just a little bit longer and less revealing.  I also decided to create a garment that he would wear around his neck.  For Jucodon his neckwear would be a small piece of leather that would be cut into thin strips and yet still connected in a circular fashion.  As before I wished them to appear and had him put them on.  “Fits perfectly,” he said, obviously in reference to his sizeable cock.<br />
 <br />
Now that everyone had their attire, I was ready to leave George’s house behind for good.  Since I gave none of them any kind of footwear, I made the same wish to cover all of them as I had for myself and Bozantum.  I also made the same wish that no one would find anything wrong with the outfits any of my creations wore.<br />
 <br />
“Let’s go,” I said.  “Wonders await us.”</p>
