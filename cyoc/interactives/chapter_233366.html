<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny stared at her reflection in disbelief. Her mom had somehow transformed her into her younger brother. feeling her new dick snugly in her now boys underwear, where she has already looked and was not ready for it, with her nearly throwing up, seeing it and not believing she now has a dick, and knowing now seeing in the mirror it is her fucking Brothers dick, and She couldn&#39;t remember if Jack was 8 or 9 when he wore this dumb scout uniform, but now, here she was, staring at herself as a kid again. How had her mom managed to get her into this without waking her? And why on earth did she have to wake up in Jack&#39;s stupid uniform? As soon as she woke up, she knew something was wrong. She wasn&#39;t at all ready to see this body—her brother&#39;s body—under that ridiculous outfit. There was no way she was spending a minute longer in this body than she had to.<br />
<br />
She headed for the door, hating how small her brother was when he was young. Jack didn&#39;t hit a proper growth spurt until he was 12, and now her head barely reached the doorknob, which had been at her waist just yesterday.<br />
<br />
She could hear her mom downstairs, cooking, and the smell of pancakes wafted up. Jack&#39;s favorite, and now she understood why. The aroma was making her stomach growl, but Jenny was too focused on escaping. She needed to find her mom and demand answers. She easily maneuvered her new small body down the stairs. Jack had always been a fast kid, constantly getting into trouble for running in the school halls. But when she reached the kitchen, it wasn’t her mom. It was a man. A man who looked very familiar. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; she asked, unable to believe her eyes.<br />
<br />
The man turned around, smiling, and said, &quot;Good morning, Jack. I see you’re all dressed for the forest in your cool scout uniform.&quot; He laughed, clearly enjoying the confused look on Jenny&#39;s face, who was now trapped in Jack&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it would be good for you to have your dad back for a bit,&quot; the man said. &quot;I found one of his old shirts from when he was 28 in the back of the closet. And being a guy is quite nice, especially seeing Dan alive, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s head was spinning. She felt a lump in her throat. It was really nice seeing and hearing her dad again. She wanted to run and hug him, to feel him, but knowing it was her mom, she didn’t know what to do. Tears welled up in her eyes and she couldn’t hold them back. This was her dad, the man she had missed for the last eight years, looking at her with concern and love.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, honey, I’m sorry,&quot; the man said, quickly kneeling down and hugging her. &quot;I didn’t think about how this would feel for you and Jack. But think about it: you can have your dad back for at least two weeks while we’re camping. Well, sort of. I know I’m not really him, but I can be like him, okay?&quot; He kissed the top of her head, his familiar warmth and smell making her cry even more. &quot;And we can do lots of father-son stuff, alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
For ten minutes, Jenny sobbed, clutching the man who looked and smelled exactly like her dad. Eventually, she calmed down, realizing her mom thought it would be nice to have dad back, even if just in this way. Maybe she was right. Sure, it was still her mom inside her dad’s body, but the illusion was almost perfect. <br />
<br />
The man, noticing she had calmed down, said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you sit down and have some pancakes? You’re going to need your strength for today. And I should wake your sister, but maybe you should talk to her first and explain what&#39;s going on, okay, Jack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny reluctantly walked to the table, drawn by the smell of the pancakes. &quot;Dad, I&#39;m not staying like this,&quot; she said, sitting down. &quot;It’s funny, okay, but I’m not going to be my brother as a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
She knew there was no point in arguing further now. It was 8 AM, and her mom must have used the medallion to transform her around 10 or 11 PM last night, meaning she’d have to wait another three hours to change back. She took a bite of the pancake and found it delicious. No wonder Jack loved these so much. She found herself wolfing them down, barely stopping to breathe.<br />
<br />
But her new dad—or mom in dad’s body—interrupted her thoughts. &quot;Sorry, Jacky, but you’re staying like this for the next two weeks. Your sister will be you as a 9-year-old. I think it will be good for both of you to see what it&#39;s like. Trust me, you’ll love running around the forest as a boy. And I’ll find something your sister likes to do. As for the medallion, I’ve hidden it. I’ll get it back once our little holiday is over. And remember, you’re young enough now that I can give you spankings!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny was shocked. she did not want to be stuck like this feeling the small dick and ball she now has, She wanted to protest, but she remembered how her mom used to spank her when she was younger and knew she would do it again, especially in such a strong body. Her dad had been quite strong when he was alive. She realized she had been shoveling the pancakes into her mouth without thinking and had finished them all. She let out a burp and was about to say something when her new dad came over, ruffling her short hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go wake up your sister and explain that I’m her dad now, okay?&quot; he said gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jenny muttered, hopping off her chair. Her legs hadn’t touched the floor the whole time she was sitting, and she was glad to get away from her mom-now-dad. She needed to think. Maybe her brother, now in her body, might have an idea of what to do. She ran upstairs and into her brother&#39;s room, where she saw a girl who looked exactly like her when she was 9, staring into the mirror, looking like she was about to cry.</p>
