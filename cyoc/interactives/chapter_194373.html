<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erica now happily made her way towards her desk, Ethans serum had worked wonders.<br />
<br />
At 19 the brunette woman was overflowing with energy as she practically floated through the office. It only improved her mood that she had noticed some of her coworkers checking her out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never knew you like me fellas,&quot; she thought with a grin. Thinking back Erica had always been a bit of a wallflower. If she were judge herself she would say she was cute but bot drop dead gorgeous. She wasn&#39;t like Carolyn the sorority girl or Melissa the sexy secretary. Brown hair that descended just past her shoulders, C cup breasts that had begun to droop at 40 and a rather ordinary face. Erica felt she was just another face in the crowd.<br />
<br />
That had changed now, Ethans serum had made her more than 20 years younger. Ericas face was now adorably cute, giving her a girl next door quality. Couple that with a thinner waist, curvier hips, firm breasts, and brunette hair that hadn&#39;t looked this healthy in years and Erica felt she could take on the world. Still, she wanted to get a better look at herself.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for her Ericas boss was out for the day. Quickly she now grabbed the spare key from her desk, unlocking his door before locking it once more. Smirking she made her way towards the full length mirror he had in his office. As she now posed in the mirror she couldn&#39;t help but fantasize about herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really your the captain of the football team,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;And you want to go out with me!&quot; Erica blushed, laughing girlishly as she gazed at her appearance. Maybe when she started going to college again her day dreams would become a reality. &quot;I better start seeing if I can enroll in some classes first,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
Melissa paused for a moment as she studied herself. Her skirt and blouse may have been a bit roomy but they were still functional. What she was curious about though was her legs. As she had gotten older, she had hated now fat her thighs had become. Now, covered by sheer panty hose, they appeared flawless. &quot;Mght as well take a look,&quot; she grinned. Stepping out of her heels, Erica now removed her pantyhose, gasping at her flawless milky legs. They looked perfect. Not as long as Carolyn&#39;s but certainly fantastic looking. &quot;Now more nylons for me,&quot; she smiled as she made her way towards her bosses computer.<br />
<br />
Stretching Erica now began to scan through colleges, seeing if it was too late to enroll. Unknown to her, she was still growing younger. The changes were subtle, Erica less like a college student and more of a high schooler. Soon enough a pretty and innocent looking brunette teen of 16 sat at the desk.<br />
<br />
Erica remained unaware as she continued her decent through high school. As her feet grew smaller, her heels began to grow larger. It started slowly, her heel pooping out of her shoe before she flexed her ties bringing it back into place. As the girl went from 15 to 14 though her heels finally clattered to the floor, the teen gazing at them curiously.<br />
<br />
Erica pushed back from the desk, raising an eyebrow as she now tried to put her foot back into her shoe. &quot;Huh they&#39;re big,&quot; she whispered. Shaking it off she now tried to fit her feet back into them once more, chalking up the looseness to the fact she had removed her pantyhose. Placing her feet firmly on the floor, Erica continued to scan through colleges as she went from 14 to 13.<br />
<br />
The changes were picking up speed as puberty began to reverse itself. Ericas breasts were growing smaller, her face rounding as she inched closer to childhood. At 12 the girl paused, noting the cuffs of her blouse inching over her hands. Not to be deterred she simply rolled them up her arm as she continued her search.<br />
<br />
Erica was now firmly in her preteens, puberty vanishing as she grew shorter. Ericas legs now began growing shorter, her feet gradually lifting off the ground, carrying one of her heels with it. As she hit 10 and sped for 9 the heel finally lost hold of her diminutive foot, clattering to the ground.<br />
<br />
Shaken from her web search, Erica glanced down only to shriek like the little girl she had become. &quot;Whats happening to me? I&#39;m SHRINKING!!&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a moment for Erica to process it that she wasn&#39;t getting smaller, she was getting younger. The 8 year old girls small feet now dangled several inches from the floor, swinging idly. Jumping from her chair Erica gasped as her skirt and panties puddled around her. The office seemed much larger than when she had entered.<br />
<br />
Erica now sprinted towards the mirror as fast as her tiny legs would carry her. Skidding to a stop in front of the mirror the girl could only gawk at her appearance.<br />
<br />
Erica couldn&#39;t be more than 7 now. The girls blouse acting like more of a dress now as it brushed her knees. Ericas chest was completely flat, her face round and innocent with large eyes framed by her dark hair. Erica now squeaked in shock as the girl in the mirror grew smaller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erica? Erica? Are you in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan,&quot; she asked, her voice sounding small and weak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Erica its me,&quot; Ethan replied. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica paused looking first at the door before looking at her reflection. &quot;No,&quot; she stated, a bit of anger in her young voice. &quot;No Ethan I&#39;m not okay! I look like a six year old!&quot; Erica let out a small yelp as the girl in the mirror grew smaller. Ericas face rounded more as her blouse now descended past her knees. &quot;Check that now I&#39;m five.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Erica but their appears to be some...complications with the serum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica could only roll her eyes as she cast an incredulous look at the door. &quot;Ya think,&quot; she grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m working on getting the others right now before we head back to the lab,&quot; he said. &quot;I can fix this Erica. Will you be alright by yourself for a few moments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; she replied, wincing at the childish tenor of her voice.<br />
<br />
Ethan told her not to worry as he now sped off towards whoever was left. Erica was now left staring at her 5 year old self as she sighed heavily.  She had wanted to go back to school, she just didn&#39;t expect to be going back to Kindergarten.</p>
