<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the road, you stare in the forest through the bus window after you and others have been on the tour for two hours. You look back at the others; Tom and Isaac play video game that connect to the bus’s TV as Sam, Leon and Jung. Dan and Uthman are reading a novel on their phones at the back of bus as Gabe in wolf form sleeps on the floor with them. While Carl is doing push up on the floor in bedroom as Qadeer sleeps in his bed. Eric sit in front seat reading the map for Rob who is driving the bus. And Jung who sits with you, is listening his music on his smart phone. There is nothing much after your group drove past resident of Gay Park, except the forest and Gabe was sure that his former pack was not around here anymore. Because of Enforcers are the strongest group and the right hand of the master, no matter how strong of Andreas and his pack are, that still be the problem to fight head on. And there aren’t many cars driving on the street, too. <br />
“It’s so refreshing to see new things and something you don’t see much, isn’t it?” You hear Jung’s voice and look at him who is smiling at you. You smile back and say “Yes, you’re right.” Both of you look at other brothers as they’re doing their own activities as Jung is moving closer to you and holding your red rubber hand. There is no secret between you and Jung that you two have developed the feeling more than brother neither biologically real brothers. ‘It’s not that bad to live like this.’ you think. ‘I wish and you, dad and mom are doing fine too, Max.’<br />
After driving so long, your group camp at riverside town for a day. This town is built alongside the river and it leads to the big lake where so many houses are built on it. This is more like the riverside Village in Bern, Switzerland, but what’s different are so many waterways in town and so many bridges for crossing them. Each home in riverside has their own boat, too. This town is mixed area and people in this town and visitor wear clothes, too. Twelve of you have to wear our own clothes. And without saying, after living without wearing cloth more than two months, you feel weird, so are other seven older brothers of this group. At least, Gabe, who still in his wolf form, can walk around naked without any problem. Since you and others arrived here around 5 P.M., the town fills with people on the street to have a dinner, on the boat riding in a river, lights on the street and some birds fly back to their nest in the green mountain as background of this town along with pure lake and sunset. View of this town is beautiful and unique at the same time. And obviously people in the town stare at your group, too. Well, you and your brother are most attraction around here at this moment. Thirteen athlete mid-teenage boys (12 plus a wolf) in different color, full rubber suit are wearing clothes and walking around the town. And all of your group’s pants aren’t good enough to hide the shaft of your own manhood.   <br />
“Look like we attract all of the people here” Jung says with a smile on his face as people, who stare at you, are murmuring. <br />
“Yes, dozen realistic rubber dolls walk in the town. It’d be some groundbreaking, wouldn’t it?” Eric replies as Qadeer and Uthman start to feel embarrassing. <br />
Without care, your group continues to walk around the town before having a dinner. “Say, what the risk of staying in this town?” Carl, who was police-in-training, skeptically asks and everyone looks at him “there are no way this is normal town, aren’t there? So what a catch?”<br />
Leon looks around and says “it doesn’t have any suspect things in this town. Maybe this town is like safe zone.” <br />
Rob shakes his head and replies “there are no safe zone in the Pleasure Island. I guess there must be human traffickers or kidnappers here at least.” But Gabe interrupts “I smell fish around the town.”  <br />
As you understand your silver wolf brother said, you ask “you mean there are mermaids and alike here, are you?” And Gabe nods his head.<br />
Tom says “If it’s mermaids, they either drag you down by force or use their voice to hypnotize you to the lake and turn you into a fish or follow mermaid. That’s what I heard.”          <br />
Some of you look at the beautiful and clean lake as we are walking around. You think ‘Ohhh, this clean and beautiful lake hides dangerous things in there.’ <br />
In the end, we brought the egg-sharp lantern from local shop before, your group have a dinner at some local fish food restaurant after a discussion about how danger of this restaurant in kind of area. ‘But you come here, you need to try it once.’ You think and luckily the pet (Gabe) is allowed in this restaurant. The restaurant is good, which you all have to pass the fountain at the center of this town, your group and customers are enjoying the delicious fish dishes and good relaxing music. To be specific, the music makes you feel relaxed than you are comforted, as if it’s trying to hypnotize you. When you look at your brothers, you know that they feel the same. “This is ironic. If we enjoy the music too much, we’ll get caught” Isaac says while eating. <br />
“Don’t talk like it, Bro” Sam grumblingly says. Everyone knows one of your clay little brother’s hobby is to listen music for relies some stress because as a closet gay, he could consult anyone or asks anyone for help. Recently Sam has played some music instruments, and he is really good at it, too. <br />
“Let’s not think too much, we will leave here tomorrow anyway.” Eric says as he looks at the customers who are enchanted by the music. Some of them have already drooled and their eyes are in a daze. <br />
Rob looks at Gabe, who is eating big fish on the floor and asks “Gabe, are there any mermaids here?” The young silver wolf looks up and sniffs his nose, before he replies “Just two, the singer woman and the employee at cashier.” ‘OK, the singer is not strange but the cashier one is strange.’ You think as you look at two of them. Singer, who is a very beautiful woman with long shine bright blue hair and blue-green eyes like the sea, is aged around mid-twenties and has smooth white skin like a pearl. She looks like a siren, the mermaid (in west folklore) sings a song to hypnotize people on the sea in the legend. Now you notice that singer’s skirt is too long for her legs, it must be to hide her fish tail. And the man at a cashier, he is the eye catching, as if he is a good-looking idol that can make some woman shame in his feminine figure. And the merman at cashier uses the counter to hide his lower part. Think again, you can understand why the merman is the cashier. The reason is to attract the people who walk pass the restaurant. <br />
“You know, it’s kind of funny. At first peoples’ eyes us like we are elephants in the room, but now they don’t even care about it.” Isaac says as he chuckles. “Right. Who even thought that dozen rubber boys in clothes walked into the restaurant for a dinner?” Tom replies as same manner. <br />
“Is this normal for us who turns into rubber can walk around like this?” Qadeer, who is new to this, asks as Uthman nods as if he want the answer.<br />
Rob the eldest replies “Yes, It’s normal. Everyone, who lives on this island long enough, knows that there are no strange if you see rubber boys, some satyr or nuked girls walk around on street.” <br />
“How is the food, Dan” Leon asks his second younger brother, who eating with delight manner like a robot. The answer he got from his indigo brother is “It is edible.” After you and others are dumbfounded why your former magic doll brother, everyone is laughing out loud.<br />
“My, what a branch of lovely kid, we have here.” The voice makes us stop laughing and look at another table. You see the guy in his forties with adventure style clothes, smirks at you all. <br />
Rob cautiously asks “Who are you, mister?” and the man replies “My name is Raphe. Kids. I’m just a traveler, who have stuck in this island for a long time, and tries to survive without getting changed.”<br />
Carl, who haven’t talk until now, asks “So you are going to say that you know more than other. And that’s why you aren’t affected by her music now.” “Bravo kid, let’s me guess you were a police or a detective who got changed, weren’t you?”<br />
We are shocked by Raphe’s assumption, while he smiles wider as his guess is correct. Eric little bit annoyed, asks “Alright, Old man. You still didn’t say what you want from us.”<br />
“I’m amazed and interested in all of you, kids” Raphe points his finger at you and others in the circle. “Just by your appearance, you all should be older than your look and got turned into this form. But that’s not the main point I’m interested. What I want to know is how you all still have free will, even though your mind and your appearance completely turn into a kid. You even have a werewolf in your little group.” Raphe seriously says.<br />
You and others, expect Gabe growls at Raphe and Dan, are shocked. In your mind, you are in a panic and think ‘This guy is a real deal. But I don’t know what to answer him.’ But Rob regains himself and replies “We were just lucky that we ran away before we completely changed.”  Raphe gives the look and says “So the yellow one is a leader.” “I’m an eldest brother.” Rob interrupts, but Raphe continues “Sorry, Kids. But I just wanted to the method to increase my chance to survive, that’s all.” Raphe stands up and looks at the window. “And the last warning, I think you can guess what’s going on in this town. What you should be aware is not only just this restaurant, but also this town at night too. Oh, the music tone has changed” Raphe walks to pay a bill at the cashier and walk out while you and others now notice that music indeed changes from relaxing one into somethings arousal. And some customers, who didn’t sleep by the music, has panted like they are on aphrodisiac drug. Women start to pucker their thigh, to cross their own hands around for rubbing their own breasts, to pin their own nipper while inserting another hand’s fingers in their vagina, and to moans. Men are rubbing their erected dicks in their pants. Some of them don’t even bother about their decent anymore, showing their own assets. All of you know, without doubt, what’s going to happen next.   <br />
“We need to go, before they start their mating season.” You seriously say and everyone agrees with him. All of you pay the bill and goes out. You briefly look back at cashier and people in there. Indeed, the merman at the cashier smirks at you and move his mouth as if he says “Good luck to escape his town” as customers, who still awake, fuck their own mate.<br />
Outside of the restaurant, the mist is covering the town and you still see the view of the town clearly. “Man, if I stayed there any longer and saw those dicks, I would go on too.” Eric complaints as his dick now throbbing in his pants as well as all of you and others, who agree with him. <br />
Carl seriously says “Does anyone remember the way back to our bus? Rob.” Rob looks around again and sadly says “Sorry, Carl. I don’t think I can remember the way out with this thick mist. What about you, Gabe? Can you find the way?” <br />
“And where is the old man, Raphe going?” Leon curiously asks as you see no trance of Raphe nearby. But Gabe frustrated and says “No, I can’t smell anything but fish in this mist.”<br />
“At least, we still have this lantern to light up.” Sam says as he holds the egg-shaft lantern up.<br />
On the way back to the tour bus, all of you are walking around as Gabe and Rob walk in front line you, Isaac and Leon are next line. Qadeer, Uthman, Dan and Sam, who have the lantern as center of the group, while Jung, Eric, Carl and Tom are on the back line. “Man, just the first day of vacation and it’s already got us a good time.” Eric quietly jokes about our situation as he watches over out backside. <br />
Jung quietly laughs and replies “think it as a survival in horror town.” <br />
“You guys are too relaxed.” Sam complaints as he sighs.<br />
You pat Sam’s shoulder and says “there are nothing wrong to be calm or relaxed, Sam. If anything happens we will help you.” “Thank bro.” <br />
“But I have to say that people who sleep probably are safe.” Carl says his opinion as he has observed.<br />
When Rob sees Gabe sniffs his nose, he signals us to stop and be quiet. When we don’t make a sound, we hear a moan nearby. All of you hide in some house’s corner and peep. What you and your brothers see is two mermaids are rapping two men passionately while men are trying to struggle out and bagging the mermaids release them. Both men can’t do anything but moan as two mermaids wrap their thin beautiful arms around men’ body and arms, warp their fish tail around men’ leg, and move their hips to pump their vagina at men’ dicks. But different is one of the men starts to grow and change while another one is not changing. Skin of man, who is growing, is lightening and his body thinner, or you should say the man is more feminine. His legs start to merge into one as some part of his body is growing scales, especially legs-turn-into a tail. He is growing fin at side of used-to-be upper thigh, his back and end of his new tail and he is developing gill at his lower neck, too. The more time passes, the less protest and struggling. But comparing two of men, changing one is more cooperating than another; he even starts to be lead one in this fucking session. That makes you wonder what difference between both men makes one changing into mermaid but another isn’t. The mermaid releases her grip to let new merman fuck her to his heart’s content, while another mermaid puts more press in her grip as if she want her man releases all of his seeds in her womb. Then the man and mermaid stop move like they finish, so the mermaid releases him and press her hand on her stomach. And another couples have just finished as merman pulls his long big spire dick out of mermaid’s vagina as he kiss her deeply. Finally, three of them jump in the lake and leave the poor man in his misery state. <br />
“Finally, they go.” Leon says and sighs out loud. Qadeer worries the man and asks “What are we going to do with him?” “Let’s check him up” Isaac suggests.<br />
After your group walk to the man and check him. You find that the man is still human apparently. “I don’t understand why he doesn’t change, but his friend changed.” You ask.<br />
Jung touches his chin and skeptically says “maybe this guy was raped by a mermaid that had the eggs in her womb.” Everyone looks at him “I mean that the mermaid has a bigger stomach than another one that changed the man into a merman and she actually touched her stomach, too, as if she cared about her eggs in her womb.” <br />
“That’s correct, brother. That mermaid is on her period. That’s why she needed the human sperms to fertilize her eggs in her womb and not changed this man for not changing nutrients in sperms.” Dan dutifully explains. Uthman curiously asks his indigo brother “So It means mermaids can only mate with humans to reproduce, right?” <br />
“Not quite. Mermaids on period needed male sperms to fertilize her eggs. It can be human sperms or merman sperms (milt), but human sperms are more affective.” <br />
“Why do they care? Mating with who isn’t matter as long as it feels good.” Gabe says aggressively. <br />
“You know Dan need to attend communication skills club.” “Yes, social skills class for Gabe, too.” Tom and Isaac says make you other laugh as Gabe angrily protests “who care what others think about what I do.” And Dan replies “that’ll be good experience.” <br />
Rob, who stops laughing, says “alright, guys stop. We need to move this guy and go back to our bus.” But Leon suddenly asks “Where should we take him to?” as he points at the man, who lying on the ground. “He is out cold and out of juice now, that’s for sure.” Carl reports as he sits down to check the man. “I don’t think it’s a good idea, guys. He will scream at us after he opens his eyes.” Qadeer says but Jung cheerfully replies “I think that’s everyone’s reaction after got raping” And everyone agrees with him, except Gabe and Dan who don’t seem to care.<br />
“I will carry him? I don’t know where we should take him to. But I think we should take him with us until we find a place to hide him.” You say. Everyone looks at you and Jung, who concerns about you, asks “Are you going to be okay?” And you replies “No problem.” <br />
Despite of your body as a mid-teenager rubber boy, you can piggyback carry him without problem. ‘Good to have good muscle body.’ You think proudly. As your group moves around through the mist, your group encounters with mermaids few times. Either they crawl on the road, swim in a lake, or fuck each other. But thank to Gabe’s nose, we can hide before mermaids see us. The more time passes, the thicker mist is to the point you can’t see what is outrange of lantern’s light. “Man, this is really a survival in horror town, isn’t it?” Jung says to light the mood. “Yes, this is so thrilling. But this is an R-Rate movie, you get raped, maybe vored instant of getting killed.” Eric says with cheeky smiles. <br />
“I’m amazed that you can find it funny in this kind of situation.” Qadeer, who slightly smile, says. “I kind of agree with them, we need to be cautios, but not stressed ourselves too much.” Rob says as he securely smiles at his forest rubber brother. That makes not only Qadeer, but also Uthman feels relieved.<br />
Sam looks at you and asks “What about you, Alex? Are you Ok?” You look back, pat your clay rubber little brother with faintly smile on your face and say “It’s Ok. Our bodies don’t have muscle just for show.” “Yes. I hate to admit, but I have never had this much muscle before.” Uthman says as he touches his arm muscle with proud face. <br />
“Right. Advantages of his body are strong muscle, hyper stamina for sex, huge dick, high body-changing resistant, and still human figure.” he raises his finger every advantage he says. “But there are some kinds of disadvantage too; easily horny sometimes, too much attraction and mid teenager boy.” Isaac complains. “But the best of all is you have the freedom to think and to do anything.” Both of them say at same as everyone completely agrees with them.<br />
But your conversation is stopped because of Gabe’s growling. Rob seriously asks “are mermaids nearby really dangerous?” Gabe growls louder is really to confirm it. So you and others carefully move around. Then you suddenly smell something make you nauseated. It’s not just you and your brothers and the man on your back now has gloomy face, too. The farther your group continues to walk in this direction, the more you hear the moan sound and feel something awful. <br />
At center of the town where a big fountain is, what you see is so happy and terrified; happy that you see the fountain that means you almost arrive at the bus and terrified that there are a merman at the fountain along with women shakily lying on the group near him. The merman is muscular more than another merman that you’ve seen so far and he is biggest one. He has two large fin on his back and some small fins at the ears, both sides of his lower tail, ankles and both of thigh that waving around his throbbing big spire dick. He sits still at the fountain as those women are clinging to the ground, moaning and touching their maidenhood. You don’t understand what’s going on here and why the smell makes you feel sick. “What is the smell? It makes me want to nauseate.” Leon uneasily says as he covers his mouth. Everyone here has the same reaction without the man on your back start to pant, except Gabe, who still growls, or Dan, who doesn’t show it. <br />
“It’s his pheromones.” Everyone looks at Dan, who says “That merman has released his pheromones to make females go on their period and to make terrorist for threaten other males who come in.” <br />
‘So this smell is his pheromones.’ You disgustingly think as you see those women are fucked themselves while that merman watches them with a sneaky smile. “But it’s strange why that merman hasn’t fucked them yet.” Carl curiously asks. You think the same thing too. “Because his pheromones contain some milt in it. With method, that merman can make women pregnant without inserting his genital in those women’s. Even though comparing to direct his milt into those women’s womb, that method has so much lower chance for those women to be pregnant.” Dan explains as you look at the merman’s throbbing dick as if sprouting some invisible things out.  <br />
“So what are we going to do?” Sam asks. And Rob seriously replies “we should help them, we need to pass this fountain to go to our bus and I don’t think that’ll be a good idea to find another way in this misty.” And looks like, everyone agrees with his idea.<br />
Rob, Eric, Gabe and Leon volunteer to knock the merman out. Rob, Eric and Leon turn their arms into tentacles with hooks at their end. Don’t want to waste a time, Gabe rushes to strike at the merman first, and the merman, who is shocked, swings his big fish tail at Gabe. But Gabe bites his tail back. The merman feels pain, screams as he swings Gabe out of his tail, but Gabe sinks his fangs and grips on the merman’s tail strongly. While the merman is busy with Gabe, other three use their tentacles to bind the merman’s arms, neck, stomach and tail. To stop merman’s screaming, Rob pushes one of his tentacles in the mouth. This merman tries to free himself, but his effort is in vain. Gabe takes the chance, releases his grip and inserts his hands in the merman’s sheath, which causes the merman struggles more and makes a sound louder. You and the reminders have moved the women to the nearest house and put them together after you place the man the ground near the lantern when Sam puts it on the ground. Those women are so wet in their pants, but at least they are calmer now. Back Rob and other’s side, Gabe moves his arms up and down as he bites the merman’s dick.<br />
Gabe now is an animal in heat, lunges all length of his erected silver canine dick in merman’s butthole which are below of merman’s sheath in one go. The merman, who can’t endure the anally penetration, is struggling stronger. That’s the alpha in-birth for you, Gabe completely dominates the merman as he has released his pheromone to overwhelm merman’s pheromone. To the point, the merman starts to wimp as the bitch. But the problem is your silver wolf brother releaseing too much pheromone makes you and your other brothers feel horny. “Damn it. Gabe, control yourself. You make us horny.” Tom complains as he holds his erected white rubber dick. But Gabe doesn’t respond to Tom’s comment and still fucks the merman faster. “He really goes wild, doesn’t he?” Isaac asks as he moves closer to his white rubber twin brother. It’s not just twins, who seeks each other’s body. Jung and you start to rub each other’s dicks as well as others after putting down pant zippers. Leon, Rob and Eric, who are nearer than you, their rubber hard dicks are leaking precum while they are badly binding the big merman because of Gabe’s pheromone. Gabe howls in pleasure as he is thrusting his dick in and out, the merman, who is being abused, starts to feel a pleasure from thrust that he is receiving. After merman summits to Gabe, three brothers release their grip and rubs their own dicks. The merman, who is free, has no strong to do anything but let Gabe anally fuck to his heart’s content. The merman and Gabe have moaned in rhythm until Gabe pierces his knot in merman’s butthole. With more impact and deeper of his thrust, the merman feels sensitive through his whole body makes him cum. A load of his opaque milt shoots out of the merman’s dick like a fountain broken and splashes all on the ground. The merman, who still sprout his milt on the air, shakes his body stimulates Gabe’s canine dick that tie with his butthole. Gabe, who can’t hold back the sensitive rubbing his silver dick, pumps his gooey silver cum in the merman’s butthole. Suddenly wave of pleasure flows in his butt, the merman sprouts more milt more after another. All of you have seen the activity and feels hornier to the point that you have leaked your hot red juice from your large rubber dick many times as much as others. At the end, the merman is knocked out after cumming too much as Gabe’s dick still strike in his butt. <br />
For yours and others’ part, don’t satisfy just masturbation. But all of you don’t have much time, because firstly you are still in danger and secondly you are staying at the center too long. So all of you close your pant zipper and prepare to go back to the bus. As for those women, they are sleeping, after effect of the merman’s pheromone died down. <br />
But you are shocked by what you see. The man, who had helped, now is merging his dick with the egg sharp lantern. You, Jung and Carl runs to help him and pull the lantern out of his dick, but all is in vain. “It’s completely stricken.” Jung says.    <br />
“What’s going? Hey, you snap it out.” You shout, depressed. The man, who likely is hypnotized by the lantern, doesn’t listen and moves his hip faster. After few second, he shoots his cum in the lantern makes it grow. “This doesn’t look good.” Sam worriedly says as he looks at the man is fucking the lantern. “We need to do something” Qadeer says, but Uthman interrupts “yes, but how?” Now the lantern has already merged all of the man’s dick. Dan, who has stayed still until now, turns his arm into three branches tentacle and insert them in the man’s nostrils and mouth. In few second, the man stops moving. “How can you do that?” You ask out loud and Dan, who turn his hand backs to normal, answers “I pumped my pheromone in him through my tentacle to surpass the egg&#39;s hypnosis.” You are amazed your indigo rubber brother. While Tom and Isaac are checking the man, your two older brothers and Leon tries to help Gabe pulls his dick out of the merman’s butthole. Tom pushes the man too hard, makes the man’s head hit the ground. The man is out of trance and groans in pain. <br />
The man, sits and looks around with frustrated feeling on his face. The last thing he remember is he and his friends, who came to this town with him, was raped by the mermaids. The man jumps up and looks around again. “Who are you guys?” He asks loudly, tremblingly points his finger at all of you. “We are just a group of kid, who carry you after you were out of juice.” Jung friendly says with a sincerely smile on his face. The man doesn’t feel less anxiety or reduce any his doubt, and you can’t blame him after what he’s faced until now.   <br />
“Look. If we wanted to harm or fuck you, we’d done it already.” You don’t want to beat around the bush, say as you sigh out loud. The man thought a few second, before nodding his head as he considers what you said. Suddenly the man realizes that he only a torn shirt, his face is redder as he quickly covers his private parts. Then he freaked out as he sees something round is swallowing his dick. “WHAT THE HELL IS ON MY DICK?” he shouts loudly while he is pulling the lantern out of his dick. “Don’t try, bro. we have tried, but it doesn’t even budge.” Jung says with a sympathetic smile.  <br />
“What am I going to do? And what’s going to happen to me?” The man, who doesn’t know what to do anymore, asks hopelessly. Then all of you hear something coming in your way. Carl says “we need to move now, guys.” Agreeing with your brother, you pull the man, who is in a panic, to run away with your group while Leon, Eric and Rob are helping Gabe pull his dick out of the merman’s butt. But Sam asks “What about those women?” <br />
You have forgotten those sleeping women, become worried, but those are seven of them. If you bring those women with you, all of you will get caught for sure. “I think they should be safe.” You and others look at Uthman who speaks. “I mean, what we see so far, the mermaids haven’t attacked the ones who had already slept, right?” Uthman says but you can hear a little doubt in his voice. As far as you know, you wish that Uthman’s theory is correct as you all run away from the fountain closer after Gabe pulled his dick out. <br />
After your group ran away, the mermen crave out waterway near the fountain. They come to check the big merman as if the one is the treasure. They are frustrated and ague each other about something, before they carry the big merman back to the waterway. There are two men jump down the roof. “Man, did you see Raphe? That rubber wolf fucked the shit of out that royal merman as if it’s his bitch.” One of the men, Raphe’s partner happily says as he is laughing. “Just like I said, those kids are interesting, they still have a free will after turning into rubber dolls.” Raphe, who smirks, replies as he uses the big spoon to scoop some of colorful gooey cum from the ground and puts all of them in the bid flask. “And you want them, don’t you?” Raphe’s partner asks as he smirks back at Raphe while helping Raphe gather the sample substances. And Raphe replies “that’s what’s in my mind, but I need to watch them a little longer. And Gary, get me that royal merman’s milt, too.” “Yes, my boss, you are really a slave driver.” Raphe’s partner, Gary chilly comments.<br />
Your group have finally arrived at a parking lot where your tour bus is and you all relieve to see the bus. On the bus, you see the same light of lantern from another side of your bus. For your group’s safety, you, your brothers and the man go inside the bus and watch it from the window. You are more shocked what you see as well as some of your brothers and especially the man. The big mermaid lays eggs, which looks much like the egg sharp lantern that is now swallowing the man’s crotch, with lustful face. She even makes an arousal sound every time she lays an egg. There are many small eggs and two human sized eggs lie on the ground. But what you focus on is the content inside the human sized eggs and the eggs is bright you can see its content; there is a man cuddle himself in each of those two eggs. And the naked man outside the bus, whose body is being absorbed by the big egg as he is hugging the egg and moving his hip in and out of it. If it continues like this, the egg will be bigger until suck all of that man’s body in. <br />
You look back at another victim in the bus as his face is pale and says in horror “I’m going to become one of them, isn’t it?” You don’t know how to cheer him up, but Rob, who hasn’t talked to him yet, asks “How can you still control yourself? From we have seen, you are supported to mindlessly fuck it egg by now.”  The man scratches his hair with both of his hands in frustrated, says “How could I know? All I remembered are; I was raped and then I woke with this thing already on my dick.”  <br />
Carl taps his ship and replies “Maybe because Dan injected his pheromone at you, that’s why.” You say “It must be that reason. Now you think about. Didn’t Gabe use his pheromone overwhelm that merman’s pheromones? It should be the same.” The sibling nod their head and look back at the man. Rob, who smiles, says “Sound like you are going to stay with for a while. My name is Rob, the eldest next follows is Eric, Alex, Jung, Leon, Carl, Tom, Isaac, Sam, Dan, Qadeer, Uthman and Gabe. We are brothers” Every siblings raise their own hands up as Rob calls their names. “Nice to meet you.” All of you say at the same time. The man, have been depressed and doesn’t anyone else to help him in this situation, feels grateful that you all help him and introduces himself. “My name is Brian, thirty one years old. I came here with his friend, Cross, who turns into the merman. Thank you for saving me and nice to meet you all, too.” You’re glad that the man, Brian feels better now. Then Brian suddenly points his finger at your silver rubber wolf brother and asks “How the wolf is one of your family?” Gabe shrugs and change his wolf form into werewolf form. “Because I’m a werewolf, idiot.” Gabe, who smirks at Brian’s shocking face, mockingly says as you and others are gigging. “Then we need to release our pheromones to help you not be hypnotized, guys.” You, who have a naughty smile on your face, dearly say as you look at your rubber brothers, who have the same expression on their face, except Dan. <br />
Brian, who is confused by your siblings’ behavior, now is redder, because you and your brother start to strip. Brian now feels frustrated and embarrassed as he has watched all of you are showing your big dicks and pack of muscle bodies. Brian thinks he is quite a handsome guy, but he has to admit that your siblings and your bodies are better than him at his teenage. Finally, Brian gathers his courage and asks “Wh..Why are guys naked?” And your green loudmouth brother, Eric replies “Bro. normally we don’t any clothes, but this town restricts that everyone has to wear clothes.” Brian tries to understand, but fails, so he asks again “And you are OK with that, I mean going naked on street.” the forest rubber brother, Qadeer and Gold rubber brother, Uthman are so embarrassed because they just changed around couple days ago. But Sam, who sympathy with those two younger brothers, nervously replies “You will get used to it.” “And there are some places of this island where you need to be naked to go there, too.” Rob adds. After hearing the answer, Brian is dumbfounded by unreasonable of this island. You and others chuckle as you all now nude. Rob brings the towels to Brian and Gabe for sleeping on sofa in large living room. All of you go to sleep on their own beds while Gabe is sleeping on the floor and Brian is sleeping on the sofa. You don’t know what’s going on outside the bus as the light is still there. But it doesn’t matter to you as long as your brothers are safe and sound. So you plainly release a little bit of your pheromone for Brian as you sleep. Finally, you lose your conscious.<br />
---<br />
As all of you sleep, Brian has problems; one is that he is naked and he can’t complain about it to your group because all of you are fully nude and don’t have clothes same size as him, and the second is that he is so horny that caused by the pheromone. To the point, he starts to press his both hands on his eggs and fucks it like he fucks a male sex doll ass. After moving his hip for a while, Brian starts to notice that his sexual orientation has changed from a perfect straight guy to gay. This change should terrify him, but he doesn’t care as he moans and shoots his cum in the egg. The more time passes as he has cum, the bigger egg becomes as it’s absorbing him in it. But the difference is the egg now is darker. Brian, who still fucks the growing egg, doesn’t care about the difference, but the egg is changing. At first, the egg has soft skin like a water balloon, but now it has sticky and gooey skin like a latex. No matter how thing is going to happen to him, he still fucks the big egg. <br />
In the morning, you sleep soundlessly, hear someone screaming makes you wake up. Then you look around. You are shocked that there is human size egg is where Brian supposed to sleep. You can’t help but shout “guys, we have a problem.” After all of your rubber brothers waked up, you all check the egg. And you notice that you can’t see anything in Brian’s incubator unlike the two eggs that you saw outside the bus yesterday. Speaking of outside, you see the residents picking the small eggs around the parking lot, but the big eggs anywhere. “Look like our theory is wrong.” Qadeer says. “What are we going to do with him now?” Sam, who looks at his older brothers, asks. Rob lets out a long sigh and replies “We can’t do anything for now.” But Yellow brother is interrupted by a crack sound and he looks at the egg that is hatching. The shell is breaking, and the white liquid is leaking out from the cracks. After that, what you and others see is a cyan (green blue) color skin child merman, who is around your age, is stretching and yawning. The kid merman looks at your group and lazily says “why do you all look at me like that?” <br />
You don’t know what to say at this point, since the victim seems to not know what’s happened to himself. But our Chinese blue brother voluntarily answers “Brian, don’t you know what happened to yourself?” “What are you talking about, bro?” Brian confusingly asks back, then he looks down to see his own body. ‘He is going to freak out’ all of you think. As you expected, he screams in a panic after he looked his own body. <br />
Nothing is much to say, Brian turned into a muscular merman kid. His skin is the cyan like an ocean blue along with fin, which has fish scales around, on his back moving like an ocean wave. There are fins at the edge of his fish tail and on both sides of his hips that looks like mini hands covering his crotch. He has grills at his lower neck and ocean blue eyes and short hair. Let’s just say, Brian is shocked and amazed at his new body very much as he touches his body “My body is a rubber and fish scales on my body is also rubber.”<br />
But you asks “Brian, except of your body, are there anything else change?” Brian tilts his in confused and Rob kindly explains farther “Alex means your mind or your memory changed or not, because we are more childish after we changed.” Brian thinks a minute and answers “My name is Brian, thirty one year old merman. I just came back to this hometown with my cousin, Cross yesterday and some mermaid asked to fertilize her eggs. So I helped her while Cross went back home with the mermaid’s friend. After that, I met you guys who let me stay here. So here we’re” All of you feel horror and more as Brian is telling about his story.  <br />
“But Brian, you were perfectly human before today.” You say, but Brian is dumbfounded, nervously replies “But it can’t be true. I was born a merman.” “Brian please, takes a look at this.” Carl interrupts as he gives a thing from Brian’s torn cloth pocket. Brian is more shocked as he looks at the thing that sky-blue boy gave him. It’s his picture as human with two old humans standing with him and another picture is him and Cross as human, too. Brian is shaking, becomes horrified, so he can’t even urge the word when he opens his mouth, you know that he wants to know ‘how’.<br />
“I thought that you were shocked that changed into a merman.” Leon skeptically says, but Brian shakes his head in denial, says “I was shocked that body turned into a cyan rubber kid.” Everyone becomes silent for a few minutes. Gabe bakes “Why are you guys so down? This guy is still here, isn’t he? Is this good enough? He can do anything that he wants too, can’t he?”<br />
Now all of you laugh and Rob proudly smiles, rubs Gabe’s head as Gabe’s struggling against it. But Sam, Jung and Leon rub his body, too. “You guys stop. It’s trickle.” Gabe’s trying to push his brothers back, but all in vain, as Eric wipes his imagine tear, says “Our wolf boy has grown up.” Gabe’s more frustrated while you and other siblings are laughing. “You can go with us, Brian.” You suggest and Brian now feels better, replies “Thank you, guys. And please take care of me.” Everyone is happy to have a new family member. You notice that Qadeer and Uthman are more relaxed to be near Gabe and Dan shows more of his emotion. Rob stops rubbing Gabe and asks “Alright then, we should have a breakfast here before we go or we should go and find the place to have a breakfast. What should we do?” In the end, we decide to have a breakfast here, because we don’t know how long we are going to meet next town.<br />
In the town, Rob, you and Sam voluntarily go to get the breakfast at a hotdog stall nearby. People in town continue their own lives like nothing happened at night, it’s weird. But you can understand this is a norm of this island. While going back to the bus, you hear someone talking to your group “Oh my, you kids are still alright. I’m quite worried that you kids didn’t survive the night of this town.” Three of you look at your right side and Raphe smirks, is lighting a cigarette as he sits on the bench. “Thank to you, we could escape, but that isn’t what you are waiting here for, right?” Rob cautiously says as you and Rob are on guard in front of Sam. “You are really smart, yellow bro. I just want to ask you kids two or three questions.” Raphe relies as he is clapping his hands. Rob looks at Sam and you, and says “What do you want to know?”<br />
“First: How did you kids turn into rubber dolls?” Raphe asks, causes you and Rob is redder. Let’s just say both of you too embarrassed to answer that question. Few minutes pass by, any of you don’t say anything, and Rob shyly says “We turn into this after wearing a condom.” Raphe, after hearing it, laughs out loud. <br />
Raphe pants after laughing so long, and hoarsely asks “Second: where is the condom right now?” Now you come to think about it ‘I completely forget about it until this guy asks about it.’ Since you were the one who found in the haunted house, Rob lets you answer. “I found it at haunted house near the first city that I came to this island. But I left them at the port around two months ago. So I don’t know if it’s still there.” <br />
Raphe taps his chin, thinks something and then asking “Last question: What’s happened the man that escaped with you?” Rob, Sam and you are terrified by how Raphe knows, but Sam timidly asks “Did you follow us last night?” Raphe smirks, says “Yes, I was really enjoying the show that your silver werewolf performed with the royal merman last night. Now please answer my question.” Since Raphe saw everything, that means he knows what Brian were supported to turn into a merman. But he wants to know what is we did to help Brian. Rob swallows his saliva, carefully answers “He’s safe for now.” Raphe nods his head as if he understands what Rob says, you’re completely sure that he do, and he says “thank you, kids. See you next time.” With that, Raphe stands up and walks away. You can&#39;t think anything, but you know one thing. You will definitely see him again as he said. <br />
At the bus, Rob, Sam and you tell others what we talked with Raphe – which makes all of them disturbing – while having breakfast. After that, everyone prepares to go on the road, and finally Rob starts the tour bus to drive to the next town.</p>
