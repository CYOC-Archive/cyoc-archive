<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and his dad arrived at the beach. They stripped down to their underwear, not having brought swim trunks. Jeff’s dad knew his package was gonna look small in his son’s briefs he was wearing but if Jeff didn’t know any better he’d say that his dad almost wanted to be caught with a small package. For a man who was always bigger in terms of penis and testicles, it might be kind of erotic to be the smallest one in the room, so to speak. His little penis stood erect in the tighty whities.<br />
<br />
Jeff, on the other hand, was bulging insanely in the underwear he took from his dad’s drawer. His dad was slender but he was even more slender, which made the bulge look even bigger. There they strode across the beach. A fifteen year old with his dad’s big equipment and a 35 year old with a below average package. They felt all eyes on them.<br />
<br />
They laid on the beach next to one another checking out the guys that passed. Sure there were plenty of attractive women on the beach too, but neither of the two men had any interest in women since their sexual encounters with one another.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jeff’s recently ex girlfriend spotted them on the beach. She came over with her dad. Judging by the lack of a bulge in her bikini front, she had purchased the other machine and went back to having a vagina.<br />
<br />
“So you’re gay now? And you honestly expect me to believe that,” Jeff’s ex said to him.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ve always been gay but I didn’t realize until I met someone who sparked that in me,” Jeff said, blushing. His father knew he was talking about him and couldn’t help but smirk a bit.<br />
<br />
“So who is this mystery whore man who turned,” she asked. She wouldn’t’ve guessed in a million years that it was Jeff’s father right next to him that was his first gay experience. Jeff could still feel the wondrous sensation of his dad’s big penis inside him from when he had a vagina.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I don’t like the way you’re talking to my son,” said Jeff’s dad, “Your dad is welcome to stay, but you can leave young lady.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s ex hit the road but her father oddly stayed. “Sorry about her. She doesn’t get that sexuality can’t be helped. I’m gonna have a talk with her when we get home. I’m Gabe. I’ll gladly accept your invitation to sunbathe with you. And nice underwear. My daughter said she’d only come to the beach with me if I wore actual swim trunks. Said she’d be mortified if I went in my undies,” Gabe laughed.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s a shame,” said Jeff, “but I actually brought some extra pairs if you want to change now. What’s she gonna do, walk home? Besides, she’s not sitting with us anyway.”<br />
<br />
“I guess you’re right. I’ll take you up on a pair of underwear,” said Gabe, “and this might be kind of inappropriate, but you have a tremendous package! I’ve never seen one so big. Let alone on a fifteen year old.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks gabe. I don’t think it’s inappropriate. Dad is always telling me the same thing,” Jeff said, winking at his dad.<br />
<br />
“Boy, he sure doesn’t take after you,” said Gabe, looking at Jeff’s dad’s small package.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s dad blushed profusely. His little penis that had gone back to being flaccid immediately became hard, “Yes, I don’t really know where it came from. Sometimes I feel like he should be the dad. You know, the one in charge.”<br />
<br />
This conversation started to make Gabe hard as well. The thought of a dad being submissive to his big dicked son was kinda hot. He shyly retreated to the changing room with the briefs he got from Jeff and returned shortly after. Gabe’s package bounced in the briefs as he walked towards them. It was in between the sizes of Jeff and his dad’s package.<br />
<br />
“Now this is much more comfortable,” said Gabe, scratching his balls a bit through the cotton before laying down with them. Gabe’s daughter had their beach bag and consequently all of their towels. There was no other choice than the three briefs-clad men to share the two towels they did have. They made the space work by spooning each other. Gabe could feel Jeff’s massive boner pushing against the middle of his ass, but instead of complaining, he almost seemed to be grinding on the boy’s package imperceptibly. Jeff’s dad was a little spoon to Gabe, feeling his boner on his backside.<br />
<br />
The men laid like this for hours, not giving a single fuck about passers by who were staring.<br />
<br />
Gabe’s daughter eventually came over, red-faced, to collect her dad. She was mortified that he’d changed into tighty whities and even worse, that he was spooning with her ex boyfriend and his father in public! He reluctantly left with her and secretly gave Jeff and his dad a wink. He’d left his number on a piece of scrap paper from Jeff’s beach bag. Jeff and his dad looked at each other knowingly before heading home, eager to hook up with Jeff’s ex girlfriend’s father.</p>
