<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cameron rubbed his head, a brief jolt of confusion running through him as he eyed the cat, enjoying his orange fur and the hypnotic swish of his tail. As he gazed at the tabby, confusion soon gave way to clarity. Elliot was..Elle. They hadn&#39;t just &#39;hooked up&#39; before, they were married! <br />
<br />
Without asking, he grabbed the tabby&#39;s thinner arm and whisked him over to a corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what the fuck!&quot; replied Elliot, confused yet sightly aroused by being manhandled by the thickly muscled tanuki. <br />
<br />
Reaching a corner out of earshot of the other counselors Cameron turned to Elliot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elliot....fuck...I mean Elle. Listen. We have to go find somewhere private. Something weird is going on. Our minds are all....messed up. This isn&#39;t us. This camp is...doing something to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what the fuck you are talking about man&quot; The tabby replied.<br />
<br />
Glancing back and forth to see if Soren, or any other counselor for that matter was listening, Cameron turned back to Elliot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, can you just trust me? I need to talk to you somewhere private. This is important&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay....I guess&quot; Elliot replied, glancing at the large paw that was tightly grabbing his bicep. The raw power of the grip sent shivers down his spine to the tip of his tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me&quot; replied Cameron as he led the way outside. <br />
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sam opened his eyes in a haze of confusion. Since he wasn&#39;t staying with coach, the team captain had stayed up late with his teammates, drinking and partying  and trying to make the most out of staying at this god forsaken camp. Sam was the biggest guy on the team and, coupled with  his status of captain, he made a habit of bossing his team mates around. He relished power and control and wanted nothing more out of life than to prove he was the alpha. On the field, he was by far the best batter and no one ever questioned his unique utility to the team&#39;s success. In class, he was equally successful, in large part due to his penchant for wielding his father&#39;s wealth and own physical presence to bully teachers into giving him As.  A senior- he already had a scholarship lined up for the top business school in the country, and he was driven to use his dominating personality as a force in the business world.<br />
<br />
His raw masculine drive for power and status and dominance over his teammates,  however, were the furthest things from his mind right now. As he looked around, nothing seemed right. Under his body he felt what appeared to be hay and in front of him he saw not a cabin full of beds but a tall, flat wooden wall. His stomach loudly growled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Better give me my oat bag soon&quot; he idly thought as he sat up to examine his surroundings. The wooden wall, it seemed, was not alone. On all four sides of him he was surrounded by low wooden walls that seemed to create an enclosure around him. A stall. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he saw his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;no...no...fuck....no this...this is wrong&quot; he thought as he gazed down at a  large, furred horses body. His body. Scrambling to his feet, he turned his heavy head to look himself over, in the process not quite realizing just how easily he took to standing up on four legs. He was massive. As he eyed himself he took in the rippling muscle and sleek, shiny black fur. &quot;I&#39;m an Arabian&quot; he mused, as knowledge of his own breed, knowledge he&#39;d never had before, flowed into his mind.&quot; From his neck a long cascade of wavy hair flowed down his side. It was longer than your average horse and its sheen and wave suggested he was well groomed. Despite his size, the look gave him an almost....feminine quality, a quality that elicited an angry whinny from the newly changed Arabian.<br />
<br />
At the sound, he heard a rustling next to him and up stood what appeared to be a Clydesdale. While Sam was large, this horse was almost monstrous. His thick, rippling muscle and tree like legs stacked him over a foot taller than Sam and his sheer width required what looked like a double stall. The horse snorted, and seemed to be looking around in confusion...a similar confusion as Sam.<br />
<br />
Oddly, as Sam stared at his stall neighbor he somehow knew the horse  had been his team.mate Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just great, I&#39;m stuck in here with that fucking nerd.&quot; he thought<br />
<br />
While Sam had been the physical star of the team, Matt was the brains of the operation. A co-captain, Matt engineered the team&#39;s tactics and many felt his raw intelligence was the real reason for their success, not Sam&#39;s excellent batting. This made him a rival. Same hated Matt from day one, something that wasn&#39;t lost on Matt. Matt, a force in his own right, brushed off Sam&#39;s jealousy. While smart - Matt had a massive ego. He KNEW he was the smartest on the team and his grades and tactical abilities had many believing him a tactical genius. The military academy took notice, and had offered him a sweet heart scholarship complete with a stipend, no amount was too little to secure his tactical abilities. Matt prized his brains and frequently flaunted his knowledge, making others feel dumb and belittling people who couldn&#39;t understand the world in the unique way he could. He especially relished dominating  thickly muscled and comparatively dumb jocks like Sam. Matt was certainly not the cream of the athletic crop, his thin frame, while well suited for endurance, was ill-suited for strength. He&#39;d had to use hid mind to get where he was and knew that to maintain his status, he had to push around those bigger than him to make it clear his mental abilities were a match to their strength. <br />
<br />
Matt turned his now massive head and looked with confusion at the horse he somehow knew to be Sam. Confusion was something new to Matt. While he&#39;d pieced together he was a horse, for some reason his brain just seemed to be moving ....slower. It was as if being in this heavy, muscular, equine body.....the type of body he&#39;d never had...was putting a clamp on the speed of his thinking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck&quot; he thought, the words seeming to flow through his mind like molasses &quot; I don&#39;t want to be some dumb brute. And I definitely don&#39;t want to be stuck in this stall with Sam of all people&quot;<br />
<br />
As he looked over the Arabian next to him, an odd scent drifted into Matt&#39;s nostrils, causing them to flare. The scent was heavenly, intoxicating and complex. His already muddled thoughts swam as he let out a wicker of enjoyment and  thrust his head in the direction of the heavenly Oder. Oddly, he found, the scent was flowing from Sam....from the back of Sam. Mat shifted  turning around to face Sam&#39;s backside and get closer to the scent which he increasingly found not only enticing but also....arousing. Slowly, his equine member began to engorge and his eyes dilated in need. Without thought, he pushed his muzzle over the divider drawing mere inches away from Sam&#39;s backside. That&#39;s when he say it. A twitching, aching vagina stood between Sam&#39;s legs and was emitting a steady supply of that glorious scent. <br />
<br />
Whether Sam knew it or not....it appeared he was a  Mare.<br />
<br />

<br />
As Soren busily prepped for the day&#39;s full roster of activities he heard a piercing whinny travel over the camp. Glancing towards the Camp&#39;s stables that they used for their horse riding lessons, he grinned. &quot;looks like our team captains have finally woken up.&quot;</p>
