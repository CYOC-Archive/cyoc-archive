Lily yawned and stretched as she woke up.  She had slept terribly.  She didn&#39;t know if it was a result of the experiment or because she spent all night on a hard metal slab, but her whole body felt achy and sore.  <br />
<br />
As Lily sat up, she felt a pressure on her chest, weighing her down.  She looked at her chest and saw that her breasts had enlarged again overnight.  She wasn&#39;t too surprised.  She was afraid that her milk production might have been permanently increased.<br />
<br />
Great, she thought.  So I am going to have to milk myself every day?  Just great....<br />
<br />
As Lily swung her legs off the side of the bed she noticed something else.  Her feet were touching the ground while she was still sitting in bed.  Previously her feet dangled over the side when she sat on the bed.  Somehow her legs had gotten longer!<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t all.  Her legs were thicker, too.  The fabric of her shorts were ripped, revealing wide legs filled with a mixture of fat and muscle.  She hopped up off the table.  It groaned a little at the loss of the weight had been bearing.  She stomped over to a mirror, her large bare feet slapping loudly on the concrete floor of the lab.  Her whole body had grown bigger, from her head to her toes. Her arms bulged with mass.  She wasn&#39;t fat, but the many added pounds of tissue had definitely given her a very curvy figure.  She was chunky, but in all the right places, with wide hips that gave her an exaggerated hourglass shape.  Lily turned and looked at her rump, bulging in the confines of her shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God! My ass is huge!&quot; said Lily.<br />
<br />
Turning to the mirror, she realized her breasts were even bigger than she thought.  She had placed them at a DD when she woke up, but that was she thought she was still a petite 5&#39;4&quot;.  Now that she realized she had to be at least six feet tall, her breasts had to be proportionately bigger, maybe even in the JJ range.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really am a cow now!&quot; wailed Lily.<br />
<br />
Victor walked into the lab, still a little groggy and dazed. We had a mug of coffee in his hand.  Igor grabbed frantically on the sleeve of his lab coat and pointed at Lily.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Igor?  I am too tired for games this morning......whoa!&quot;<br />
<br />
Victor stopped speaking when he saw Lily.  He dropped his mug in shock. It shattered on the floor of the lab.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear God!  There must be a leak in the containment chamber.  Quick, Igor!  Seal the room!  We have to keep it from spreading,&quot; said Victor.<br />
<br />
Igor motioned frantically, but Victor ignored him and bent down to examine his machine, searching for any sign of damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Victor.  It was me, &quot; said Lily, still sobbing a little. &quot;I used the machine on myself last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Victor paused, halting his spastic actions.  He slowly stood up, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; he said solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry!  I didn&#39;t mean to do this.  I didn&#39;t mean to ruin your experiment and well.... everything, &quot; said Lily, before breaking into sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, it&#39;s okay, dear,&quot; said Victor, as he rushed over and patted her.  &quot;It was my fault.  I should have known it was too great a temptation. But we can still complete the experiment today, no harm done...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No harm done?  I am a freak!  I look like a reject from some pervert&#39;s milk maid fantasy!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I think you look quite charming.  There is nothing wrong with being a little....curvy and full figured,&quot; said Victor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charming, huh?  Do you think this is &#39;charming&#39;?&quot; said Lily.<br />
<br />
She squeezed one of her breasts.  A stream of milk shot across the room, mixing with the coffee already spilled on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, &quot; said Victor, rubbing his chin again.  &quot;Now that IS interesting.  But it&#39;s nothing that we can&#39;t manage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean you can reverse this?&quot; asked Lily hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I am afraid not. You see, the device stimulated the milk ducts in your breast tissue, causing them to grow and multiple at an astounding rate.  Apparently, this also stimulated the release of other hormones that caused your body to grow and....um, develop, kind of like a second puberty, if you will, &quot; said Victor.  &quot;But the device can only stimulate growth.  There is nothing in science or nature that can reverse growth or development.  Nature doesn&#39;t work backwards and you can&#39;t un-break an egg. I suppose we could use radiation or surgery to remove the excess breast tissue and the milk ducts within it.  But it would not do much good.  The changes to your skeletal structure - the extra size and length of your bones - are irreversible. You could perhaps reduce your weight a little by diet and exercise, but not by much or it would be unhealthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s hopeless,&quot; said Lily sadly, plopping on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say that.  This is still a young science and I am learning as I go.  Each day I make tremendous gains in knowledge about lactation.  It is possible that I might be able to alter your milk production, make it a little more manageable.  Certain hormones might be able to slow or even halt it entirely.  But it will take time and I will need help.  Your breast tissue will allow me to increase the speed of my research by leaps and bounds.  But I wouldn&#39;t just use you as a guinea pig.  I really do need another assistant, someone who is not afraid to take a few risks in the name of science.  What do say?&quot; asked Victor.<br />
<br />
Lily popped up, a smile plastered on her face.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Victor. You got a deal,&quot; said Lily as she shook his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that is some grip, &quot; said Victor, shaking sore his hand.  Victor found himself looking up at the now taller young girl with a little more respect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, Victor. Guess I am still getting used to being like this, &quot; said Lily, blushing a little and acting coy. Suddenly, Lily&#39;s clothes fell apart with a loud rip.  She did her best to cover her nudity.  &quot;Whoops!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Igor! Stop gawking and get this woman some clothes,&quot; said Victor. &quot;I think my dear mother may have left something behind that might fit her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Igor returned grumbling with a pair of large lederhosen.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this some kind of joke?&quot; asked Lily, holding up the foreign garments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, my dear.  But I am afraid this is the only thing I have that will fit your  .... unique body type,&quot; said Victor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great. So now I don&#39;t just look like a milk maid, I look like a German milk maid,&quot; said Lily. &quot;Could I be any more of a freak!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually this is the traditional clothes of my people.  My grandfather wore those everyday while he worked on the farm.  And, I must say you look quite fetching in them,&quot; said Victor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Victor,&quot; said Lily, blushing a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough, chit chat.  We have much work to do and very little time. First, I would like to draw some blood and maybe get a sample of your breast tissue.  Then, we need to test those mice.  My investors expect to see results very soon.  Igor!  Fix us some breakfast while we work,&quot; said Victor.<br />
<br />
&quot;No milk for me,&quot; said Lily with a smile.</p>
