<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was now fully Jason in all his current form and mannerisms.<br />
<br />
He was smoking and drinking and becoming the total slob that Jason was <br />
and Ryan had discovered as he had changed. Jason had kept this part of <br />
himself hidden but when he went home he found himself doing very un-<br />
Ryan like things.<br />
<br />
Left to his own devices Jason would drink to excess, smoke like a <br />
chimney and eat like a condemned man. And so he did.<br />
<br />
When he returned to the test site the next week for his checkup he had <br />
become a chain smoker and was half drunk stumbling into the office.<br />
<br />
So what's up doc. Ryan/Jason slurred, giggling at his little pun with <br />
the doctor.<br />
<br />
Get undressed we need to make some measurements.<br />
<br />
Ryan/Jason did as he was ordered but getting out of his pants almost <br />
had him taking a header into the examination bed.<br />
<br />
Woa! Jason said trying to stabilize himself.<br />
<br />
Ok now I see drinking and smoking has really settled in.<br />
<br />
Yea yea. I hear that all the time. But then as he was saying that <br />
Ryan/Jason tried to remember who had said that to him. It seemed as <br />
though people had said that to him for years but he hadn't smoked <br />
before he started this test. And his drinking was limited to <br />
occasional nights out with the boys but now he seemed to do it when he <br />
woke and didn't end till he passed out.<br />
<br />
Ryan/Jason stood up and the Dr made some measurements. Chest 42 <br />
inches, Waist 38 inches, neck 17 inches, biceps 12 inches, legs 18 <br />
inches, weight 198. Jason was in fairly good shape but that 38 inches <br />
concerned the Doctor. It should have read 36 but that wasn't too off. <br />
The other measurements were spot on.<br />
<br />
Come back and see me next week.<br />
<br />
Ryan/Jason got dressed and stumbled out the door and went home.<br />
<br />
When he returned the next week he had changed a bit. He seemed to <br />
tolerate the drinking a bit better now and even though he was drinking <br />
more he wasn't stumbling around like he had the previous week. He was <br />
smoking just as much as he had the previous week. And his shirt no <br />
longer fit. He hadn't tucked it in because it wouldn't fit and the <br />
last two buttons couldn't even fit together exposing the bottom of a <br />
wife beater t-shirt that rode up almost to his belly button.<br />
<br />
Ok you know the routine get undressed.<br />
<br />
Ryan/Jason did and the change was noticeable. Apparently Jason, left <br />
to his own devices would be a fat chain smoking drunk. But he had <br />
enough money to keep himself in good shape and his place cleaned up. <br />
Ryan/Jason was showing what Jason would become if he didn't have those <br />
controls. Ryan's chest measurements had grown a bit, but his waist had <br />
gone up to 44 inches. Ryan/Jason's but had grown to be fairly rounded <br />
And what was once a furry chest going down to a furry set up abs now <br />
became a furry chest going down to a budda belly with a treasure trail <br />
into his crotch. His weight had gone up to 233 pounds.<br />
<br />
You need to cut down on the eating and drinking and while your at it <br />
you smoke way too much. The doctor told Ryan/Jason going in one ear <br />
and out the other. Here I need to give you some supplements to try to <br />
control your cravings.<br />
<br />
The doctor poked a needle into Ryan/Jason's voluminous ass and sent <br />
him on his way telling him to come in the next week.<br />
<br />
He had gone home and it seemed that the supplements had controlled him <br />
for a bit. His drinking went down to a manageable case and a half of <br />
beer a night and his smoking was no longer a chain smoking frenzy, but <br />
his eating increased. It seemed as though his drinking and smoking had <br />
his hands doing something besides eating and over the next week he had <br />
been eating more than he had ever thought possible. When he had gone <br />
in for his checkup he was wearing sweat pants and a very large Hawaiian shirt.<br />
<br />
As he waddled into the Doctors office his feet in flip flops, the only <br />
shoe he could wear since he could no longer bend over to tie his shoes <br />
were at 45 degree angles to his belly. He waddled down the hallway <br />
having to rest against the wall several times before he made it to the <br />
examining room. He sat down on the doctor's chair with a noticeable <br />
groan.<br />
<br />
What happened the doctor asked.<br />
<br />
Well I think I got the smoking and drinking in check but that left <br />
plenty of room for eating.<br />
<br />
The doctor helped him off with his shirt and pants and made some <br />
measurements. Ryan's belly was 53 inches and his weight had gone up to <br />
312 pounds. In a week?<br />
<br />
We got to get your eating in check.<br />
<br />
The doctor gave him a prescription and gave him some samples before he <br />
left.<br />
<br />
Now fill this and it should help you with your eating.<br />
<br />
Ryan went home and had his roommate fill the prescription. But his <br />
eating was no wear near controlled. It seemed as though it was in <br />
overdrive.<br />
<br />
When he returned the next week for his appointment he was now well <br />
over 450 pounds. The doctor was astounded by the growth. It seemed as <br />
though it was accelerating. <br />
<br />
What happened?<br />
<br />
I don't know I took those pills you gave me.<br />
<br />
As Ryan/Jason took off his shirt and sweats the bottle fell out of his  <br />
pocket and the doctor looked at the pills. It was the label for the <br />
prescription he had given him but the pills inside were totally wrong. <br />
They were a powerful appetite stimulant.<br />
<br />
Where did you get this filled? The doctor asked.<br />
<br />
I don't know my roommate Percy filled it for me it was just too hard <br />
for me to get to the pharmacy.<br />
<br />
Ok Ok.<br />
<br />
I need to talk to your roommate next week could you see if he could <br />
come in with you. The doctor hadn't told Ryan/Jason about the pill <br />
switch but he did tell him that he needed to stop taking them.<br />
<br />
I am going to need his help to get your appetite under control so tell <br />
him we need his assistance and that I need to discuss the particulars <br />
with him.<br />
<br />
So Ryan went home and told Percy that the doctor needed to see him at <br />
the next appointment.<br />
<br />
Ryan told Percy the lie that the doctor had come up with once he had <br />
seen the pills.<br />
<br />
When the appointment came around Ryan/Jason had leveled off and was <br />
slightly over 500 and he and Percy walked down the hall way to the <br />
examination room.<br />
<br />
The doctor made his measurements and was pleased with the slowing of <br />
his growth.<br />
<br />
Well it looks like maybe we have turned the corner on this. You have <br />
still grown way too much but at least it has slowed down.<br />
<br />
Can I talk to you Percy alone.<br />
<br />
Percy followed the doctor to an adjacent waiting room and asked Percy <br />
what he was doing to Ryan/Jason.<br />
<br />
What do you mean?<br />
<br />
I know you have been giving him this appetite stimulant. Why have you <br />
been doing that?<br />
<br />
I didn't do it you have no evidence.<br />
<br />
Oh don't I?<br />
<br />
The doctor pulled out a tape showing Percy encouraging Ryan's <br />
excessive consumption. That wont hold up in court. You can't prove <br />
anything but that I have been helping my roommate. <br />
<br />
You know your right I have nothing that will hold up in court. But I <br />
am annoyed someone is playing with my project and giving me this <br />
almost useless data.<br />
<br />
Percy tried to push past the doctor feeling a prick in his butt cheek <br />
as he went by and when he awoke he felt different.<br />
<br />
Ok Percy glad your awake. Ryan/Jason went home several hours ago. I <br />
told him you needed to get all the information for your diet. And <br />
while he has been gone I made a little change to you. I hadn't planned <br />
on going this way but you gave me an idea and I have been working on <br />
this alteration for the past week since I had found out what you were <br />
doing.<br />
<br />
The doctor held up a mirror to Percy and looking back at him was John <br />
Goodman or a reasonable facsimile. His clothes didn't fit and he was <br />
strapped down with an IV in his arm. You know that appetite stimulant <br />
you gave Ryan well this one is quite a bit stronger and giving it to <br />
you this way it will stay in your system for over a month.<br />
<br />
When it wears off you will be bigger than Ryan.<br />
<br />
The Percy part of him was screaming in fear but the John Goodman part <br />
was fine with the weight. He had come to terms with his weight long <br />
ago and now that was part of Percy's makeup.<br />
<br />
Percy went home and found his roommate taking up most of the sofa and <br />
he sat down next to Ryan/Jason. Who are you he asked. It's me Percy he <br />
responded.<br />
<br />
What happened to you. <br />
<br />
I thought it would help if we both went on the diet together so I <br />
asked the doctor to make me big and he was able to do this. Percy <br />
didn't want to tell Ryan what he had done.<br />
<br />
Oh ok.<br />
<br />
Ryan/Jason leveled off at 508 pounds but Percy/John kept going up and <br />
up.<br />
<br />
When they waddled in the next week they Percy was still a bit smaller <br />
than Ryan but gaining quickly.<br />
<br />
Please stop this doctor.<br />
<br />
It will stop in three weeks but it is slowing down. I figure you will <br />
settle out at about 700 pounds and it looks like Ryan has stabilized.<br />
<br />
Don't fuck with me boy you might get your due.</p>
