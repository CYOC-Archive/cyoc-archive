<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greta and Jean appeared back in their palace and Jean immediately went to kiss Greta but Greta had a frown on her face. Seeing it Jean asked, &quot;What's wrong my love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something just doesn't seem right,&quot; Greta said shaking her head. &quot;I think a little investigation is in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Dana said it isn't our world so there's no reason for us to get involved,&quot; Jean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true,&quot; Greta said nodding. &quot;However I think we should still investigate on the off chance that it will involve us eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may be right,&quot; Jean conceded. &quot;I know you have someone in mind for the job. Are you sure you want to use her though? They just had their second child and this investigation could be dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's the only one besides us that can handle this task,&quot; Greta said sighing.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a young woman of about twenty-five appeared before them carrying a four year old girl. The girl looked around then squealed, &quot;Auntie Greta, auntie Jean.&quot; She wriggled out of the woman's arms and ran up to them.<br />
<br />
Jean bent down and picked the child up asking, &quot;How's our little Mara doing today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great auntie Jean,&quot; Mara said with a wide grin on her face.<br />
<br />
The woman looked at Greta and said, &quot;You don't summon me unless there's something urgent you need me to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right Lisa,&quot; Greta sighed. &quot;You remember Astara and Dana right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I forget them?&quot; Lisa asked rhetorically. &quot;They almost took over our world. Please don't tell me they're trying it again. I don't want to get that close to becoming a man again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not trying to take over our world again yet,&quot; Greta said with a faint smile. &quot;No what they're doing is playing with another world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought we wouldn't get involved with conflicts on other worlds,&quot; Lisa said looking puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ordinarily we wouldn't but someone from that world came here by accident,&quot; Greta said sighing and shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you helped her,&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;What do you need me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you to find a sorceress,&quot; Greta said. &quot;Her name is Igna and she kidnapped a prince by the name of Eodor. The messenger told us that she overheard some of Igna's plan. She evidently want's to change everyone on her world to female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that isn't bad,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Maybe we could help the new females cope with the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She also heard the name Astara and we witnessed Dana coming to the aid of an impostor Eodor,&quot; Jean said shaking her head. &quot;You can be sure she has her own plans for that world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you think this Igna has allied herself with Astara?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be a reasonable conclusion,&quot; Jean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I want you to do is find Igna and Prince Eodor before they fall victim to Astara,&quot; Greta said. &quot;It might be possible to learn about Astara's plan from Igna. At the very least you could prevent that world from falling into her hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you pick me though?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are more of an anomaly than we first thought,&quot; Greta said. &quot;Remember that you saw and heard us on that first day. You even felt me in your mind. You even showed resistance to Astara's magic when she tried to take over our world. You can also sense world energies and open portals. That makes you the only one other than us that's suited to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok what world do I need to go to?&quot; Lisa asked sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look in the crystal ball at the messenger that came here,&quot; Greta said.<br />
<br />
Lisa did and saw Miggs as she was when she first came here and her form after the goddesses got through remaking it. She quickly learned that world's energy signature and cast her mind about preparing to open a portal. She paused as she sensed two people in the World of Chaos with that energy signature. One of them had the taste of a magic user about them. Looking up she said, &quot;I think Igna might be in the World of Chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greta and Jean looked at each other looking worried. Mara had been listening to everything and she saw the worried looks on Great and Jean's faces. She looked at Lisa and said, &quot;Don't go Mommy Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa came up and stroked Mara's hair saying, &quot;I have to go. Something is wrong and it's up to me to find out what. You be good for your Auntie Jean and Auntie Greta while I'm gone. And don't give your Mommy Hermione any trouble either. Help her with your sister Sara. I'll be back as soon as I can.&quot; She kissed Mara's forehead and stepped back. With a flick of her hand a sword appeared on her waist. Taking a deep breath she made a little gesture and stepped through the resulting portal.<br />
<br />
Once Lisa had stepped through Mara began to cry. Jean made shushing sounds and said, &quot;It's alright little one. She'll be back.&quot; She silently added, 'At least I hope so.'<br />
<br />
'She'll probably surprise us yet again,' Greta said silently nodding to Jean.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:<br />
<br />
Igna and Eodora were wandering around in the World of Chaos. They each knew they had to find a portal out of there. Eodora had been thinking since the portal dumped them here. Now she voiced her thoughts. Looking at Igna she said, &quot;It was quite a coincidence that the portal opened up beneath us just as you jumped from the tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why I thought you had something to do with it,&quot; Igna said. &quot;Though I know you wouldn't have trapped yourself here along with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not trapped here,&quot; Eodora said with conviction. &quot;We just have to find a portal out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will we still be the same when we get out or will we even survive long enough to find a portal?&quot; Igna asked clearly scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we'll survive,&quot; Eodora said. &quot;I'm sure that portal was created by Astara.&quot;<br />
<br />
They heard a shriek somewhere which abruptly ended. Both girls hugged each other for a moment looking around before setting off again. Igna was surprised that nothing had happened to them up to this point as they had been in the World of Chaos for quite awhile now. Being eight they were limited in how fast they could cover distances which was a problem if something came after them. When something did come after them Igna wouldn't be able to cast any spells leaving them defenseless.<br />
<br />
They continued to wander and Igna thought that they had been in the World of Chaos for an hour when a portal appeared before them. They looked at each other and started running toward it. Before they got to it Lisa stepped out of it and the portal disappeared. They stopped as Lisa looked at them then she asked, &quot;How did you girls get here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A portal opened beneath us and we ended up here,&quot; Eodora explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you two been here?&quot; Lisa asked moving her hand toward her sword while looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I think we've been here for an hour,&quot; Igna said starting to look around herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you two better stay with me and I'll try to get you back to your world,&quot; Lisa said smiling. &quot;My name's Lisa. What are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Princess Eodora and this is the Sorceress Igna,&quot; Eodora said making the introductions.<br />
<br />
Lisa was about to ask another question when she heard several things moving close by. She drew her sword and said, &quot;I'll ask questions later but right now we need to get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Igna and Eodora nodded but before they could move several demons surrounded them. Lisa prepared to fight but she didn't know if she would be able to take all these demons.</p>
