<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff had to be careful not to tear his stitches while “dilating”, while part of him was still unsure about his surgically altered anatomy, he knew the last thing he needed was to have his neopussy fall apart on him, barely a week after surgery.<br />
<br />
He lied to his parents about the procedure. After all, he was almost 19, a full blown adult and was going off to college at the end of the year. In fact, he told no one at all. He remembers being deeply in the closet and after what he did to Rhett, it didn’t even feel right to tell him. Somehow, the truth would eventually come to light, but that wasn’t his problem right now. To everyone else, he was just visiting his friends in the big city for two weeks, little did they know what he was giving up while he was there.<br />
<br />
In this universe, he traveled all the way to Portland, Oregon to have them cut off his balls and invert his dick. Health insurance covered some of it, but Jeff had to make sure they didn’t disclose anything to his parents. They may have been the policy holders, but Jeff was 18 and he had a right to privacy. Sadly for Jeff, this meant he had to take on about half the bill as debt —about $25000 all in.<br />
<br />
He packed for surgery day, ready for his new life, and his new big secret. The imminent fate of his dick was exciting, and Jeff felt incredibly horny after checking into the hospital. He’d discovered a lot of things about himself by jerking off (namely that it never felt right to have a dick attached to his body) but never really had sex with another man, or really anyone for that matter. This was his dick’s last chance.<br />
<br />
Luckily for him, the his room at the hospital was empty. No patients. Everyone else had surgery scheduled for today, so all they were doing was wheeling beds in. This gave him plenty of time to do whatever he needed to get through the surgery without making waves. One of the nurses caught his eye, he was short but fit, obviously gay by looks of his bleach blonde hair and was wearing tight blue scrubs with almost certainly nothing underneath. If only his hard dick hadn’t been sticking out of the front of his boxer briefs, he’d have tried to hit on him straight away. The nurse understood though, winking at Jeff he said, “why don’t we take care of that before you go under?”<br />
<br />
Before Jeff knew it he was lying face down on the bed, breathing heavy from sheer adrenaline. The nurse tugged the blue scrubs down around his ass and shoved Jeff’s head between his legs “Take a smell.” The nurse ordered. “Bet if yours was even half as good as mine you’d think twice about cutting it off.” The look of approval he gave was enough. Jeff plunged his mouth around the stud’s thick shaft, licking and sucking like a wild animal until the door opened and interrupted them.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Davies we’re ready for you now.” He was greeted by a hospital orderly who apparently was the one to give him instructions. “I see you’re already prepping our patient, nurse Jones.” The orderly had apparently not noticed her coworker hide his dick back in his scrubs. Jeff, though, was still at full mast from the excitement. While he waited for the team of doctors to show up, he tried to imagine all the blood and guts to calm his erection to no avail.<br />
<br />
As he expected, it took only a few minutes for the team to arrive and all eyes were on Jeff. One of the doctors introduced himself first, didn’t look too much older than Jeff, probably late twenties.  “Sorry to keep you waiting Mr. Davies, I understand how you must feel.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll have the nursing staff set you up with more… comfortable undergarments when I’m done with you.” The doctor paused slightly glancing over at the tented bedsheets. “Though you’re likely to have different problems.”  Jeff nodded. What else could he say?<br />
<br />
The Doctor went on to explain, “We usually suggest to patients undergoing surgery like yours that they consider shaving their pubic hairs, especially if they haven’t done so yet, so we have better access to remove the hair follicles after you go under. I’m reading here that you’ve already had complete electrolysis, is that correct?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked back down at the sheet covering his groin to avoid looking the doctor in the eye, “Y-yes sir.”<br />
<br />
“Well, let me be frank Mr. Davies, I’m assuming that your reason for having this operation is to enhance sexual pleasure. I can’t promise you’re going to be sexually satisfied afterwards, and I suspect your desire may be more seeded in compensating for sexual dissatisfaction caused by your repressed sexuality.”<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t believe how crude the doctor sounded.<br />
<br />
“I have no means of judging your… condition. Be advised though that this operation is irreversible and extensive. And recovery will be painful.”   He emphasized this last part.<br />
<br />
A part of Jeff knew that if his parents found out about this they’d kick him out of the house, he could kiss his hometown friends goodbye, too. But if he was so wrong about himself why would anyone want him not to change? Plus what was the alternative? To live a miserable life wondering if he’d regret not cutting off his penis forever? He knew he could deal with the pain if the outcome was worth it. <br />
<br />
Forcing himself to stay calm, he looked the doctor in the eye, letting him know that he wasn’t intimidated. He saw recognition on the man’s face and then just flat out respect. “Thank you Doctor. I’m ready to start whenever you are.”</p>
