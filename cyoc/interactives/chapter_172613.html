<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We could get in touch with your sister?  She&#39;d help you, right?&quot;  Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, maybe.  It&#39;s been awhile since we&#39;ve talked.&quot;  She sat up an let her legs dangle from the edge of the table.<br />
<br />
Josh tried to ignore how cute she was.  &quot;Well, just wish you were at her house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...should I take you home first or...&quot;  She chewed on her lower lip.<br />
<br />
Josh sighed.  &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll come with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dude.&quot; She smiled at him, and he thought his heart skipped a beat.  &quot;I wish Josh and I were at my sister&#39;s front door!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a flash of light, and they were in the hallway of a nice looking building.  There was a door in front of them, and a golden number &#39;8&#39; was attached to it.  Faint music could be heard on the other side.  Corey looked to Josh, then back at the door.  Tentatively, she reached out to knock with the knuckles of a tiny fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might need to knock louder than that.  Here.&quot;  Josh rapped on the door.<br />
<br />
The door opened, and a positively tiny girl opened it.  She was wearing nothing but a very skimpy bikini, and was about the size of a ten year old girl.  She had blonde hair done up in twintails, and while small, she had noticeable breasts, and a nice figure (nice enough that the bikini wasn&#39;t wasted on her, at least).  &quot;Oh, hello!  My aren&#39;t you both cute.  What can I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I&#39;m uh, here to see Tamara.&quot;  Corey stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you are!&quot;  She looked over her shoulder.  &quot;TAMMY!  Got some cute ones here!&quot;<br />
<br />
A woman wearing a silk kimono came into view.  She was tall, easily 6 feet in height, maybe taller.  She had long haid that fell down past her shouldrs, and dyed a pretty violet color, with eyeshadow to match and bright blue eyes.  Her skin was very fair, and her garment didn&#39;t hide her fabulous figure.  There wasn&#39;t an ounce of flab on her either, you could tell she kept herself very fit.  She wasn&#39;t wearing a bra and her breasts were evident under her kimono- easily D cups.  &quot;Oh hello there, I...I don&#39;t think I know you.&quot;  She smiled, but looked confused, her voice a pleasant alto (a sharp contrast to the perky soprano of the first girl).<br />
<br />
Corey bit her lower lip.  &quot;You know me, but you won&#39;t believe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sized Corey up.  &quot;Actually you look familiar...Mikah, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
The shorter girl laughed.  &quot;It&#39;s the best damn Tsukiko-chan cosplay I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tall girl snapped her fingers.  &quot;That&#39;s right, she&#39;s the magic girl who&#39;s always hitting the guy she likes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh snickered.  &quot;No offense, but you&#39;ve just described soooo many anime girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The boy speaks truth.&quot;  Mikah grinned.  &quot;So what are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Josh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m....Corey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamara&#39;s eyes seemed to get very big, and it made her look younger (Josh guessed her to be in her early 20&#39;s).  &quot;No...Corey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me, Tommy...I mean...Tamara.  Sorry about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, Josh was amazed at how Corey, who&#39;d never read a manga or seen an anime in his life, perfectly mimicked one Ranma Saotome.<br />
<br />
Tamara dashed forward, her kimono opening (and giving Josh a very good look at a stunning female body...) to pull Corey into a hug.  &quot;Little bro...I missed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, given their relative heights, the way Tamara had leaned over to embrace her &#39;little brother&#39; had pushed her rather impressive (and unbound) bosom into Corey&#39;s face.  Seeming to realize this, Tamara stepped back.<br />
<br />
Corey was blushing like crazy.  Mikah just giggled, while Tamara closed her kimono.  &quot;Sorry about that, bro.  Let&#39;s get you out of the doorway, come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamara sat down on a couch, gesturing for the two to have a seat.  Mikah, who was shorter than even Corey, just climbed up to perch in Tamara&#39;s lap.  Tamara idly stroked the tiny girl&#39;s hair as she talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, Corey.  I forget that I haven&#39;t always been a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey mumbled something.  Josh gave her a nudge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean..it&#39;s ok...it&#39;s good to see you...Sis?&quot;  She tried out the word tentatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, girl or not, I&#39;ll always be your big brother, Corey.  So when did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh and Corey explained the story, much to the other girl&#39;s amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh is right, that does seem very specific for STS (Sudden Transformation Syndrome).  And sudden, though that&#39;s not unusual.  It took me months to finish going from male to female, and technically, the process is still going on.  Originally I wasn&#39;t any shorter as a girl, but I&#39;ve lost a few inches since then.  As near as anyone can tell, I&#39;m still getting more feminine and girly, it&#39;s just a very slow process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I could still be changing?&quot;  Corey frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no way to tell, but we can bring you to a specialist.  They might be able to tell you more, though since you have magic...&quot;  Tamara trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;If your change follows, or tries to follow, physical laws and biology as we know them, you can be diagnosed and treated to some extent.  If, on the other hand, your change flat out tells physics to go fuck itself, there might be nothing that can be done.  We know a girl who has a plasmic form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A what now?&quot;  Corey blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a slime girl, basically.&quot;  Josh supplied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but she&#39;s metamorphic, so she can look like an ordinary girl.  Lucky bitch.&quot;  Mikah grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you have STS too, is that why...&quot;  Corey trailed off.<br />
<br />
Mikah giggled.  &quot;I look like jailbait?  Not exactly.  See, your sister here, she&#39;s a Vector.  She transmits her transformation to others like a damn STD.  If you have sex with her, you become more girly and young looking.  Do the math.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey&#39;s eyes got big (well, bigger).  &quot;Oh you&#39;re...Tamara&#39;s girlfriend.&quot;  She blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind us saying so, that&#39;s hot.&quot;  Josh added.<br />
<br />
Mikah just laughed, while Tamara blushed girlishly.   &quot;Well, actually, I&#39;m her boyfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey gaped at her.  &quot;Wha...what?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, that has to be hard to accept, bro.  I like girls and boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey shook her head as if to clear it.  &quot;No, I mean...I figured...it&#39;s just...you&#39;re a man?!&quot;  She pointed at Mikah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not anymore.  When we figured out what was going on, I...could have broke up with her, and just gone through life as an androgynous looking guy.  But I love Tamara too much.  So...we&#39;ve had a LOT of sex.  So not only did I turn into a girl, I&#39;ve continued becoming smaller and more feminine, until I&#39;ve become the loli girl you see before you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael, or Mikah as she likes to be called now, might continue to get smaller, but the more she changes, the slower the changes occur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh felt himself growing hard, and tried not to draw attention to that.  &quot;Still, if people can change just by having sex with you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamara blushed again.  &quot;Yes, I...there are a lot of people who have sought me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey felt light headed.  &quot;Wait, so...you&#39;re a hooker?&quot;  She immediately clamped her hands over her mouth.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamara looked mortified, but Mikah just cackled and kicked her legs.  &quot;Oh that&#39;s good, hahahaha...your brother thinks you&#39;re a prostitute!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically...it&#39;s not wrong.  But I don&#39;t see what I do as sex for money.  I&#39;m offering people something they could never have normally.  Men who want to be girls.  Girls who want to be pretty.  I&#39;m actually a licensed sex therapist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sex is kind of a bonus.&quot;  Mikah grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...it can be enjoyable.&quot;  Tamara admitted.<br />
<br />
Corey took a deep breath and let it out.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Sis.  I guess I&#39;m just like our old man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamara stood up so fast that she almost dumped Mikah on the floor.  &quot;Don&#39;t you DARE say that!  You are NOTHING like that man!&quot;<br />
<br />
Corey shrank back in fear of her older sibling, and Josh found himself doing the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy.&quot;  Mikah grabbed the taller woman&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...fuck...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;  She seemed to deflate, and Mikah gently pushed her back onto the couch.  &quot;I&#39;ve had a lot of therapy because of our father.  As you can see, I still have a lot of issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I am like him, though.  Just ask Josh.&quot; Corey seemed to find her dainty feet very interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh?&quot;  Tamara looked at him.  &quot;I think I remember you, aren&#39;t you...oh.  Oh God.  You&#39;re Paul Gregson&#39;s son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.  I don&#39;t really want to rat Corey out, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been bullying Josh since grade school.&quot;  Corey still didn&#39;t look up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  I know who put you up to that.&quot;  Tamara got a hard look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t matter.  I did it.  I&#39;m a terrible person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude.  Ok, I know I said I didn&#39;t forgive you, but...&quot;  Josh turned to face the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you dare!  You&#39;re taking pity on me because I look like a cute girl!  But I&#39;m not!  I&#39;m still the asshole that pantsed you in front of Mary Ann Caldwell!  I&#39;m the one who stole your clothes in P.E. so you had to walk out of the shower naked!  I&#39;m the one who knocked out your front teeth!  I&#39;ve tormented you, bullied you, and made your life hell!   So...stop!  Just stop!  Stop being nice!  You should HATE me!  I wish I was never born!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a flash of light, and she was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!!!! COREY!!&quot;  Tamara gasped in horror, and slumped to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait!&quot;  Josh held up his hands.  &quot;Listen!&quot;<br />
<br />
And sure enough, they heard the sounds of a girl sobbing.  &quot;Her magic works just like the real Tsukiko&#39;s.  When she said that in the light novels, she ended up in the bathroom crying her eyes out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikah managed to pull Tamara to her feet (an impressive feat given the well over 1&#39; height difference between the two women).  &quot;Go to her.  Now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tamara numbly headed to the bathroom, and they could hear her knock on the door.  &quot;Corey?  Please let me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened, and they could hear Corey crying, then the door closed.<br />
<br />
Josh looked to Mikah.  &quot;I...I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikah smiled softly at Josh.  &quot;You know, as a guy, being sensitive, open about your emotions, we&#39;re trained not to.  Either by society, our peers, or our parents.  Anything about us that could be seen as feminine, just gets locked away.  But turn a guy into a girl, and all that hits you like a tidal wave.  The female hormones don&#39;t help, but it&#39;s really just that we&#39;re also programmed to think it&#39;s ok for girls to be emotional, and it all comes out.  The good and the bad.  I used to think girls were huge drama queens.  Now I know guys are too, we just don&#39;t admit it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She said something about killing herself earlier.  I commanded her not to.  I hope that worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Commanded?  So what, you&#39;re her Kenji?&quot;  Mikah looked at him oddly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like that, we&#39;re not in love or anything.  He&#39;s...er...she&#39;s...&quot;  He fumbled for words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.  And yet, she&#39;s bound to you, just like in the show.&quot;  She gestured to his shirt.  &quot;I wonder if you didn&#39;t do this somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, no, I wouldn&#39;t do that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not consciously, but what if you had the power to change people?  Wouldn&#39;t you like to make Tsukiko real?  Wouldn&#39;t you want revenge- sure sounds like Corey&#39;s treated you like shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t change someone else into Tsukiko!&quot;  Josh snapped.<br />
<br />
Mikah didn&#39;t flinch.  &quot;I don&#39;t believe that for a minute.  I was a guy too, you know.  You&#39;re a teenager, probably never got a girl to take you seriously for more than five seconds.  You had this dream girl, a waifu, right?  You know everything about her, you&#39;d kill to have her in your life...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!  Yes I would!  I don&#39;t care that she&#39;s violent, or crass, or pigheaded!  She&#39;s perfect!  She doesn&#39;t let anyone push her around, and she&#39;s beautiful!&quot;  Josh didn&#39;t know why he was crying, but suddenly Mikah was there, holding him.  She smelled really nice.  Like a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, honey, don&#39;t cry.  I shouldn&#39;t have pushed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Josh couldn&#39;t stop for some reason.  &quot;...I wouldn&#39;t do that to Corey...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you.&quot;  She lay her head against Josh.  &quot;You&#39;d change yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh froze.  He&#39;d never even dared to THINK that.  He turned his head to stare down at the tiny girl.<br />
<br />
She just gave him a sad look.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to say it.  Because of Tammy, I&#39;ve met a lot of people like you.  Hell, I&#39;m one of them, though I didn&#39;t realize it at first.  Tammy helped me find the girl inside me.  And I wouldn&#39;t go back for anything.  Now, this isn&#39;t something you have to decide now, but you know what Tammy can do.  So just keep that in your head, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But..I&#39;d have to...&quot;  Josh stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have sex with my girlfriend.  Yes.  And lots of it.  But that doesn&#39;t bother me, because she has a huge heart.  She cares about almost everyone she meets.  It&#39;s so bizarre whenever her Dad comes up, because that&#39;s not my Tammy.  She doesn&#39;t hate.  She loves.  But I&#39;m the one she wants to be with.  That&#39;s so unbelievably special.  So no, I don&#39;t mind it if she has sex with other people.  Because what we have, is too awesome to let petty feelings get in the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mikah.&quot;<br />
<br />
She squeezed him tight.  She was really strong for a girl of her size!  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Big Sister Mikah is here for you, Josh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re neither big or a sister...but thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph.  I very much am both.  Boy those two are taking awhile.  You hungry?  Thirsty?  Want to fool around in bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh gave her a level look.  &quot;Don&#39;t tease.  I have a friend at school who does that all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s teasing?  You&#39;re a cute boy.  Oh does that shock you?  Well it shocked me at first too, even when I became a girl, I figured, that wouldn&#39;t change the fact that I love women.  Then one day I ran into a guy and I couldn&#39;t get him out of my mind.  It was the worst feeling ever- like something was wrong with me.  Or that I was somehow cheating on Tamara.  But we talked, and she explained it was perfectly natural.  Of course I&#39;d want to know what it felt like.<br />
<br />
Really, it was pretty stupid of me not to think to talk to her- she&#39;d gone through the same thing, after all.&quot;  Mikah shrugged.  &quot;So she rounded him up, and she was right there with me the whole time.  And it was great.  10/10 stars.  But it didn&#39;t change how I felt.  Tammy is easily 11, 12/10.  Every time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a lot to think about.  But uh, yeah, I could eat, if that&#39;s ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been a great friend to Tammy&#39;s brother.  That makes you family in my book.  Let&#39;s see what we got.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon, Josh was devouring a ham sandwich, and washing it down with sweet tea.  Mikah ate as well, but in total contrast to her brash personality, she ate slowly, with dainty little bites.  Josh would have expected her to devour her food, and belch afterwards.<br />
<br />
Then the bathroom door opened, and Tammy led Corey to the kitchen.  Both of them look liked they&#39;d been crying their eyes out, and Corey was very quiet and subdued.  They ate in silence, then Tammy took Corey to bed, leaving Mikah and Josh to sleep in the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you can take the couch, and I can take the loveseat.  Or, we both could take the couch, because I&#39;m a cuddle bunny, and I don&#39;t sleep well if I&#39;m by myself.  Or, we do that after we have sex.  Your call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really want to have sex with me?&quot;  Josh frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t toy with your emotions like that.  I think you&#39;re cute, I&#39;m almost always horny, and you do it for me.  So if you can ignore the fact I was born a guy, yes, I&#39;d love to fuck your brains out.  Tammy won&#39;t mind, and as long as you remember that no matter what happens, she&#39;s the love of my life, everything will be copacetic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about Corey?&quot;  Josh blurted out, then stood there, his mouth opening and closing, but no sounds coming out. <br />
<br />
Mikah grinned at him.  &quot;What do you know?  Freud was right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t...that&#39;s not...&quot;  <br />
<br />
Mikah took off her bikini (which left nothing to the imagination to begin with) and lay down on the couch.  &quot;Shh, come here and ravish me.  We&#39;ll both feel better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;ve never...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh.  I know.  It&#39;s ok, I&#39;ll be gentle.  Now take your clothes off.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so he did.<br />
<br />
Later..</p>
