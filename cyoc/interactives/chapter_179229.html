<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexandria sat up from her lying position, bringing her small hands up to her face. She gave her sleepy eyes a gentle rub before removing her hands and blinking a few times. Alex had hoped that the whole regression situation might have just been a strange dream, but this confirmed her fears, it was real. As she sat up she could hear the diaper between her legs crinkling. The noise sent an irritating tone to her ears as it constantly reminded her of what she currently had to deal with in life. <br />
<br />
Alex looked around her room to see that everything was still the way it normally was. The only odd thing about her room was that the blinds had been pulled down which left it pretty dark inside. The young girl got into a crawling position and began to move forward to get to the end of her bed.<br />
<br />
“That’s right, mom and I just came from the store.” A grumpy expression overtook her sleepy face as the memory of the trip came back to her. “I wanted to use my phone to text Sam about this, but mom forced me to take a nap. All because she thought I was being ‘cranky,’ whatever she means by that.” <br />
<br />
She glanced down from the edge of her bed towards the wooden floor beneath her. With her current size, there was no way for her to get down without hurting herself. Alex plopped back down on her diapered rear and crossed her arms, giving a pouting expression as she had to wait for her mother. <br />
<br />
Minutes went by and no one came to her room, could her mother not hear the squeaks from the mattress from when she crawled on it? “Mooooooooom,” Alex let out a loud wail, hoping her mother would hear the desperate cry of help and come to save her from the height of the bed. <br />
<br />
Not even a minute passed before the door swung open to reveal the girl’s mother. Mrs. Moon looked into the room with worry on her face as she eyed her small child. “What is it sweetie, is something the matter?” Her mother spoke with a kind but intrusive tone as she wanted to know why her daughter had shouted moments ago.<br />
<br />
“I want to get off of my bed mom, I’m done resting.” Alex continued to sit with her arms crossed and a grumpy look on her face. She had her eyes shut and her head was facing away from her mother, off towards the wall. <br />
<br />
Her mother raised an eyebrow and walked over to the bed. She looked down at her daughter and eyed her posture and expression. “That nap was to help you with the attitude problem missy. From what I hear and see, you still have an attitude and you’re not ready to give that up quite yet.” <br />
<br />
Mrs. Moon lifted her daughter up and positioned the girl, so she faced the shoulder. She gave Alex a diaper check to see if she had gone while asleep and hadn’t noticed. Upon feeling the back of her diaper get tugged upon, Alex grew irritated.<br />
<br />
“Mom, what the heck are you doing?!” The small girl looked up at her mother with her face nearly red from embarrassment. “I already told you that I’m not a bab-“<br />
<br />
“You are soggy sweetie,” her mother replied with a serious look on her face. “You need to stop protesting and arguing so much. I know you want to be a big girl like you were, but your body just doesn’t agree with you.”<br />
Alex’s arms went into a crossed position over her chest yet again. Her mother laid the girl down on the bed and began to change her out of the soggy diaper. The diapers that they had gotten at the store sat at the end of the girl’s bed, already opened from earlier.<br />
<br />
As the change went on, Mrs. Moon began to speak calmly to her daughter. “As I said earlier, I called your father not too long after he left for work. I’m sure you’re wondering why I called him.” <br />
<br />
Alex nodded as stared off at the wall to her right while still wearing a grumpy look. “It clearly must be important if you’re reminded me, so sure, why did you call dad?”<br />
<br />
“I called your father and asked him to pick up more supplies, as I said earlier. Although I never mentioned what those supplies were.” The woman reached down and grabbed a bottle of baby powder that sat next to the package of diapers. “You’re not going to like this but what I asked him to get is necessary for your safety while you’re this age.”<br />
<br />
Alex groaned and rolled her eyes, her eyebrows slanted down as she took on another angry look. “Even more stuff to embarrass me with? I don’t need all this mom, I am twenty and you know that!”<br />
Upon hearing Alex’s reaction, her mother rolled her own eyes. She shook her head slightly and grabbed a new diaper from the pack beneath her. “The more you fuss, the more I treat you like your physical age. I said this to you earlier and I don’t want to keep repeating myself, but you don’t seem to learn.” <br />
<br />
She lifted Alex’s rear and brought the front of the diaper against her waist. Before Alex could even attempt to react, her mother secured the tapes in a position that kept the diaper snug. “Your father will be bringing home new furniture for your room and that is final, any further fussing and I will be forced to take action.” <br />
Alex mumbled and continued to wear a blush. She sat up once her mother had finished the change and looked down at her new diaper. While she hated to admit it, the fresh diaper felt much better than a clammy soaked one. “Whatever…” Alex pouted as she was once against lifted up, her arms still crossed over her chest. <br />
“You were never this cranky when you were actually a baby. Then again you didn’t have a teenage mind back then either. Oh, what am I to do with you, Alexandria Moon?” Alex was carried downstairs by her mother who cradled her all the way. Once downstairs she brought the girl into the living room and set her down on the wooden floor. <br />
<br />
“Sit here and be good, please. I’ll let you watch whatever you want on TV or use your laptop for a while if you remain good and as I said before your nap if you need anything just call.” Mrs. Moon started to walk towards the kitchen, wanting to get dinner ready. <br />
<br />
A smirk came across Alex’s face as she looked over at her mother. “Leaving a helpless in a room all on her own? Mom, that is quite bad parenting!” <br />
<br />
Her mother turned around and glared at her daughter. She looked down at the girl and took a few steps over to her. “Are you saying that you’re a helpless baby, hm? I think that if you want to prove that you’re mature enough to be treated like a twenty-year-old, then you can start by showing me you’re capable of being left alone for a while.” <br />
<br />
Mrs. Moon’s words were not met with protests this time. Instead, all that could be heard was a grumpy “hmpf” from Alex. Once her mother had left the room, she looked around at what could be used to entertain her. The TV was currently off with the remote being placed on the coffee table which was too high for Alex to safely grab. A bookshelf was snug against the TV stand with many books that Alex had previously read or planned on reading. She got up onto her feet and began to toddle towards the bookshelf, falling after only a few steps. <br />
<br />
“Oh, come on, I can’t even stand for more than a few seconds now too?!” Alex angrily said quietly to herself. She continued to crawl towards her destination. Once at the bookshelf, she reached out and pulled a book off from the lowest shelf. She set the book in front of her and opened it up to the first page. It was a book that collected many well-known children&#39;s stories. Although her ability to read was also affected, much of the book consisted mainly of pictures and very little text. <br />
<br />
She sat on her diapered rear for a while and then swapped to lying on her belly. Her mother hadn’t put the dress back on her since it was taken off during her first change. She lay on her stomach with diapered rear sticking up. Her feet began to kick by themselves as she focused on the book more and forgot about the real world.<br />
<br />
The front door of the home clicked open as a man stepped inside. Alex heard the noise and looked up from her book to see who had come in. “Dad is home,” the young girl smiled as she got up from her book and made her way towards him, toddling over. She was about to fall when he father swiftly scooped her up into his arms and gave her a pat on the head. Alex blushed, looking up at her father as she took in what she had just done.<br />
<br />
After some greetings, her father set Alex back down by the book and went into the kitchen to see her mother. The two went outside and came back in a few minutes later while carrying something up the steps. Alex watched occasionally, unable to see what they would bring in. While it annoyed her that they went out and bought new things for her current size, she was too focused on finishing the book. It was then that Alex glanced up at the clock to see that it was now six in the afternoon, two hours had gone by since her mother left to make dinner. <br />
<br />
Various boxes had been brought up the steps to, where Alex assumed, her room. She shut the book in front of her and crawled over to the bottom of the steps. The young girl looked upstairs as her parents were just coming down. <br />
<br />
“Yes hon,” her dad looked down at Alex as he wondered what she was doing. “Are you just being curious? I know we took a lot of stuff up and were in your room for a while.”<br />
<br />
“Aha,” Alex exclaimed, a smirk coming over her face. “I knew you went into my room with all that stuff, what was all that?” <br />
<br />
While her mother went back towards the kitchen to finish dinner, Mr. Moon bent down and lifted his daughter up with two hands on her waist. Alex pouted a bit but didn’t want to be scolded by her father after having her mother do it to her numerous times earlier. <br />
<br />
“We replaced all your adult furniture with baby versions while you’re like this. We cannot have you rolling off of your bed at night and getting hurt among other things.” The man ran a hand across his daughter’s head and smiled at her.<br />
<br />
Alex opened her mouth, ready to shout about what her father had just said but her open mouth was met with a finger over the top of it. “No fussing now, your mother told me about how you’ve acted today and I’m not happy about it. We are doing our best to adapt to you being young again missy.” He set the girl back down on the floor, glaring down at her. “It would be much easier if you just cooperate. We needed all those supplies for your comfort and safety, be happy you have such caring parents. “<br />
<br />
The small girl grumbled a bit, crossing her arms again as her father began to head up the stairs. After some time, her father came down and the three had dinner together with Alex getting a plate of mashed potatoes and some baby food. She wasn’t happy about her dinner, but the food was put into her mouth without her being able to stop it. <br />
<br />
Once dinner had ended Alex’s parents brought the girl to her room. Everything she had, apart from the dresser, had been replaced with a baby version. The bed was replaced by a crib, her trash can was gone and instead, a diaper pail sat in its place. A small changing table sat near the crib and even some of Alex’s old plushies and toys were scattered about in the corner and in the crib. <br />
<br />
With a quick change first, Alex was put to bed. While she didn’t feel very tired, sleep soon overcame the young girl, her body clearly needing the rest. In mere moments she fell asleep, one arm wrapped around an old plushie of hers and the other being used as her thumb was stuck gently in her mouth.<br />
<br />
Then.....</p>
