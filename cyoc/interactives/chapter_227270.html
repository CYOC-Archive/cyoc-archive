<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doing his best with the gas pump, Jason filled up John&#39;s car, shocked at the four-digit price. By this point he knew best not to give John any flack about it, seeing he&#39;d already gotten his money&#39;s worth just by being around him. He tried to pay at the pump, before seeing an “Out of Order” sign on the credit card slot. He went back to the passenger window, knocking on it to get John&#39;s attention. John was on his phone, proudly taking pictures of his softening monster cock. He lowered the window, “what is it Jason?” he let out, putting emphasis on his new plaything&#39;s name. “I&#39;ve got to go in, machine&#39;s broken.” “Okay, make it fast,” he groaned, rolling his eyes as he went back to his phone. As Jason stepped away, John remembered pulling out the shorter man&#39;s phone. He fished the item out of the driver-side door. <br />
<br />
Jason entered the convenience store shirtless, face smeared in precum. The clerk looked at him with a smirk, lustfully staring at Jason&#39;s sculpted body. Jason, despite having savoured John&#39;s precum for the last half-hour or so, had been left thirsty from his workout. He went to the back to get a drink, finding the post-workout beverages on the tallest shelf, easily within reach. Stretching out an arm, he suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He blinked a few times, becoming aware he wasn&#39;t able to reach that shelf by himself, being only 5&#39;5”. Trying to stand on the tip of his toes, he stretched his bulky arm out, the elusive beverage being too far from his reach. He&#39;d need to ask the clerk for assistance, maybe get a stepping stool to help out.<br />
<br />
Step by step, Jason walked briskly towards the register, his shorter height always requiring him to walk with more effort than he&#39;d like. As he turned the corner of an aisle, he felt a warm caress in his gut. His heavy steps shook the ground as he waddled towards the front of the store, taking the entire width of an aisle to himself. Traps be damned, Jason lowered his gaze, his view partially blocked by his thick shelf pecs, his hard nipples out of sight, but sensitive to the store&#39;s cold gusts of AC. Stomping towards the register, his gait widened as his powerful lats and blown out biceps kept his thick arms locked at a 45º angle. His tight shorts molded around his colossal hamstrings, his half-hard package protruding through the front of the stretchy material, pushed further into view by the overdeveloped glutes his thong passed between. Every movement of his bulky quads rolled against his potent balls, constantly teasing the short wide king into passive arousal. Breathing heavily, Jason made it to the cash register, putting his girthy calloused hands on top of it. “Hey bud, I need you to grab me something,” his voice boomed out. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, give me a sec,” the clerk answered, making his way around the employee counter. The staff member was a tall man, at least a head and a half taller than Jason himself. “What&#39;s the rush,” he nonchalantly asked Jason, eyeing the fireplug with lust. Looking up at the mixed Asian man standing in front of him, Jason answered, “I wanted one of the protein drinks at the back, but do you have to put them up so high?” No later was his rhetorical question voiced, Jason felt a subtle pang in his crotch. “I tried fuckin&#39; tiptoeing, but I guess you dumbasses can&#39;t do shit right,” he yelled out, testosterone coursing through his body as he boiled with rage at the idea of this worker&#39;s incompetence. “Woah, chill out man, it&#39;s just a fuh- goddamned drink,” the employee replied back, rolling his eyes as he started walking towards the back of the store, “what flavor did you want?” Jason waddled behind the cashier, slowly trailing him, his cantaloupe sized-balls and thick 19 inches soft cock leading the way, massaged by his own quads. His package bouncing along the way, pre-cum started dripping through his tautly stretched shorts. “Fuck man, I couldn&#39;t even fuckin&#39; read those stupid ass labels, they were. Too. Fuckin&#39;. High!” The irritated yet composed employee, already at the shelves with the drinks, started listing out a few flavors, “okay, so, there&#39;s uh... Gropi- Grape and goji...” Jason, visibly aroused, with his half-hard cock threatening to rip his shorts, finally caught up to the stressed clerk, “I don&#39;t have all day shithead, read them fuckin&#39; faster!” “Patience, man, patience. Okay, so you&#39;ve got Coku- Cuke&#39;s Cum- Cumcuber Melon too, and like Lay me- Limeade, happy? What&#39;s your pi-” the tall man tried to ask. Jason glared at the cashier, “you can&#39;t even fuckin&#39; read either? Worse than useless I fuckin&#39; swear, I could do your stupid job better! Fuckin&#39; look at me!” <br />
<br />
Jason huffed his chest, ready to give more flack to the tall clerk. His throbbing monster cock was asking for release, and he knew he had to get back to John quick for more fun and relief. “Fuck, get me all of them! Shithead!” he roared. The clerk jumped at how sudden the sound was. Sharp clouds took over Jason&#39;s mind, and light tingling covered parts of his body as he sheepishly looked up at the employee, admiring the tall mixed East Asian man&#39;s bland face. He felt fingers tweak his fat nipples, loudly bringing him to his knees. His monumental soft cock flopped around in his shorts, blood rushing in to stimulate the flow of precum that signified his arousal. “Hnnnnngghhh, pl- please, I want cumcu- Cum- Cucu-” he panted out. The clerk smirked, “I guessed from the tats.” Pulling harder on Jason&#39;s tits, the employee pushed his stiffening bulge in the chasm separating the meaty tattooed pecs. The right one adorned with the letters “ESTZ”, and the left one featuring “CUM DUMP”. Jason was blissed out, precum pissing out of his perma-soft hose-length cock. He was being tit-fucked by a mixed Asian convenience store clerk, who he now just wanted to suck more than he could piece the words to say. “Fish it out,” the cashier said, biting his lower lip.<br />
<br />
The less-than-mobile Jason rotated his arms to pull down on the man&#39;s pants, limited movement making the mouth-watering task of pulling clothes down arduous. Once he had his sausage fingers holding onto the cashier&#39;s waistband, he slowly lowered them, his prize now touching his skin. “7 inches of prime Eastaze&#39; meat. Happy, uh, big boy?” the cock&#39;s owner asked Jason. He nodded, drooling over himself, “yeah, please, I- hnng- I need it-” His shorts were getting wet, sticky, his appetite for this ordinary Asian man&#39;s sub-average dick consuming him. “Fuck, haven&#39;t gotten sucked in so long,” the man lamented to himself, “make it worth my time.” He moved his hard cock towards Jason&#39;s mouth, teasing the wide man&#39;s wide chin by smearing a trail of precum on the way. “Go.” What felt to Jason like ambrosia graced his tongue, the mere taste of cockhead shaking him to his core. His floppy cock throbbed slightly in his moist, gummy shorts, a gush of precum seeping through, puddling on the floor. Hands grabbed the back of his head, running over his buzz-cut. “Shit, that must feel good if you had that tattooed,” the clerk snarled, pushing himself inch by inch into the moaning cumdump. Jason moved his hands across the man&#39;s legs, anchoring his wide hands on the employee&#39;s undeveloped ass, each cheek fully covered by his thick fingers. He groaned and moaned, milking the short cock filling him, tonguing it vigorously while squeezing the ass he firmly held onto.<br />
<br />
“Fuh- fuck man, you&#39;re guh- going too- I&#39;m-” the clerk blurted out, unprepared for Jason&#39;s experienced mouth. Gripping Jason&#39;s head with all his strength, he pushed his face fiercely against his groin, smashing Jason&#39;s nose against his pubes. His cock shook, violently shooting his load within Jason&#39;s throat. Feeling the cock expand and throb inside him, Jason&#39;s pleasure center were assaulted. His balls pulsed, and more blood rushed to his groin, feeding the muscles pushing out a torrent of cum. Howling muffled, Jason felt his sizeable load travel down his python of a cock, before gushing out into his saturated shorts 20 seconds later, seeping through and leaking onto the floor. His own short orgasm finished, the clerk kept slowly facefucking the groaning Jason with his softening cock, “yeah, big slut, let it out, breathe me in.” Jason&#39;s grunts lessened as his balls emptied out, the lake of cum on the floor emanating a strong pungent smell. Letting go of the worker&#39;s ass, Jason reflexively flexed his arms, showing his body off by force of habit. Slowly, the soft cock filling his mouth pulled out of him, leaving drops of cum on his tongue. He kept his posture as best as he could, visibly shaking and breathing heavily from the taste. Hands groped his biceps. “Fuck, you&#39;re built man. Aight&#39; bitch, so what pump, and what flavors?” the clerk asked, feeling Jason&#39;s rock-hard arms with a grin. “Hmm- P- Pump fo- four. And I&#39;ll uh- one of each. Please,” Jason replied, smelling remnants the cashier&#39;s bush sweat on his face and his load on the floor. The clerk let go of his arms and pat his head, grabbing three drinks before walking to the front of the store, “neat, leave your mess, I&#39;ll clean it up later.”<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Tapping his foot against the floor liner, John leaned against the driver-side window, sighing. “What&#39;s taking him so fucking long?” He scrolled through his phone, browsing social media to make time pass. “Oh fuck,” he laughed to himself. It had just dawned on him, “bet the clerk was Eastaze&#39; or some shit.” He licked his lips, looking down at the book resting on his cock. He grinned as he tried to imagine what the newly modified Jason was now like.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Knees moist, Jason lifted his wide frame off the floor with a loud groan, “hmmrrggg, fuuuuck!” A late splurge of cum was dislodged by the movement, joining the sticky puddle with a loud plop. Jason licked his lips, relishing in the mixed flavors of cock and sperm covering his mouth. He tried to adjust his damp crotch, only able to lightly graze the front of his gym shorts. “Guess I&#39;m not eatin&#39; my fuckin&#39; cum this time,” he thought to himself, bittersweet his glorious bulk bound him from such pleasures. Heading to the front of the convenience store, steps announced by his gym shorts squelching and dripping, Jason fished out his wallet, damp from the cockjuice he&#39;d produced. “Waterproof gym shorts the shit-eater sold &#39;em as uh,” he muttered to himself, partially enjoying the sticky feeling as he waddled through an aisle. The closer he got to the cash register, he started to feel flustered, his groin heating up as he caught a glimpse of the clerk&#39;s unremarkable face. His balls revved up as he approached the counter. “So, pump four, 3 of those, and a fat load from these,” the employee grabbed his undersized package smugly, winking at Jason, “the SLUT&#39;s total&#39;s twenty-two fifty.” Flustered, Jason slowly counted out twenty-six humid 100 yuan bills, “here&#39;s the- there&#39;s a bit more, for you...” He sheepishly smiled as he handed the cash, “th-thanks.” He bit his lower lip as he looked down, turning around and slowly waddling towards the store&#39;s exit, shorts still dripping. <br />
<br />
“Fuck, can&#39;t believe John&#39;s had to wait for that fuckin&#39; small of a dick,” Jason berated himself mentally. As he approached the exit, another man tried to enter the store right as he made it to the door. “Outta my way, dumbass,” Jason barked as he pushed the man aside. “What the fuck man? Chill out!” a voice answered, the man already outside of Jason&#39;s limited field of view. Raising his hand backwards, Jason flipped the man off, swaggering towards John&#39;s car. Once his gaze met John&#39;s through the wind-shield, Jason&#39;s put his hands together, bouncing his tattooed pecs. “Fuck yea bro!” John shouted out, before swiftly stashing the book away.<br />
<br />
Jason opened the door to the passenger side, carefully getting into his seat. The car&#39;s suspension creaked under his weight, the right side noticeably closer to the ground than the left one. “Dude, I&#39;m so- so sorry man... He just- Eastaze- I couldn&#39;t resist,” Jason regretfully looked at John through the rear-view mirror as he closed his door. His colossal ass barely fit into his seat, the two watermelon-sized cheeks pushing him forward, just like his legs did to his balls, both of which did the same to his cock. John lustfully looked down at his new toy&#39;s crotch with a wide smile, “hey bro, no need to be sorry for that. From the look of it, it was a good time.” “Yeah, it was kinda okay...” Jason trailed off. Placing his right hand on the soaked gym shorts, John wet his hand as he started driving. Whimpers escaped Jason, “hnng- he just- he was-” John, focused on the road, placed his moist hand on Jason&#39;s &#39;DUMP&#39; pec, caressing the muscular mound, teasing the fat nipple adorning it, “keep going, big lug, what happened?”</p>
