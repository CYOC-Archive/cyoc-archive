<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Well she could have one of her lovers come over, maybe Charles or Daniel. She was in a polyamorous relationship with a few people but- wait a minute that felt conflicting to what she remembered having with Jeff... oh shit... maybe she HAD been changed and didn&#39;t know! Jen opened up her profile and tried to check her transformation history, but all she got was a pop up message that said &quot;Function only available from host terminal.&quot; Host terminal... well that would have to be Jeff&#39;s computer right? Then she would have to get into his room somehow. She had to know immediately, she could worry about getting some good dick later... she hoped. But then again...<br />
<br />
At school Jeff and his two best friends had the same home room for first period with their math teacher Ms. Simmons. Ms. Simmons was a bit of a stiff lipped... well you know. Not a lot of kids liked the old codger. At 72, she should have retired already but just seemed to keep going even though it felt apparent that she didn&#39;t much like children or teaching for that matter. No one was even sure she liked math really. At 5&#39;6&quot; she sould have been a figure in the classroom but her hunch dropped her down to a much less intimidating 5&#39;2&quot;. As Sophie swayed her her large pendulous hips into class, everyone turned their head to watch. The boys, for pleasure. The girls, a mixed bag of curiosity and envy. And for Ms. Simmons, out of pure vitriol hatred. As Sophie bent down to take a seat in what was a comically small desk for her, tents were made in every boy&#39;s pants in the classroom, she was the hottest girl in school, the smartest as well and the baddest bitch in town. Popular kids in any age group didn&#39;t fuck with her, and that meant they didn&#39;t fuck with Jeff or Jorge either. Ms. Simmons despised Sophie. She was crude, rude, and an absolute waste of potential. She aced every test, never got an answer wrong, but never turned in her home work. Her opinion was that &quot;homework is a miserable failure of a shit system based off of outdated dehumanizing puritan philosophies, so no, I didn&#39;t do the fucking homework&quot; verbatum. That was the first detention that Ms. Simmons gave the harlet and its been a nonstop trainwreck ever since. She&#39;s taken to just ignoring the girl at this point since the principal wouldn&#39;t properly expel her. She was certain that weak chined do nothing had let her off the hook after a quick &quot;happy ending.&quot; <br />
<br />
Once the class had settled down and everyone was seated, Ms. Simmons began roll call. Her wrinkled and flappy arms swung swiped up her pencil and readied itself to fill out her clipboard. She strolled through the classroom with her vericose veined stilts she called legs and began the call ans response. &quot;Jeffery Alderman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here!&quot; Jeff perjected.<br />
<br />
Immediately Ms. Simmons felt a strange ting start in her ear which moved further throughout her body in a pulsing sensation. She continued roll call, and as she did, she found moving to be easier, less burdening. Her legs felt stronger and better shaped. She ran her hands across her face as she finished and her skin felt tighter on it. &quot;Class open your books-&quot; she stopped herself... was that her voice? It felt so... young. Hearing herself she felt a wet warmth in her neather regions she hadn&#39;t felt in year, like rain on a parched desert scape. Yes of course that was her voice, who else could it be? &quot;On second thought... Talk amoungst yourselves for a moment.&quot; She walked over to the door opposite the entrance, that lead to a hall which the teachers used to walk from classroom to classroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk amoungst yourselves? That&#39;s a first&quot; A young blonde girl named Anna stated bewilderedly as her teacher left the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that was weird.&quot; Jeff responded. The girl sat behind him and generally minded her own business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the bitch is finally having a heart attack.&quot; Piped Sophie, a pen dangling from her healthy lips.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a strange wave wash over the classroom. &quot;Hopefully not, Ms. Simmons as always been really cool.&quot; He said, not believing a word he just said but it felt right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah she helped me out when my water broke.&quot; Anna said her voice huskier and sultry now. Jeff looked behind him and saw a stunning blonde amazonian who was having a really hard time fitting in her chair, and getting her tits to stay inside her tanktop. He could have sworn she was an average blonde girl, 12 years old but he remembered now... Yeah Anna was held back two years, she was 14. She had a baby a year ago in this same class, it was all over school. One of the teachers got her pregnant and was later arrested. She swore she still loved him, but she also just loved having sex whenever it was available. Everyone was surprised she didn&#39;t have more kids but it was honestly a matter of time. She was 6&#39;5, had tits the size of his head, with an ass that looked like a Pixar mom&#39;s. She was gorgeous, even had the beauty mark mole and was infact in talks to become a model, she was just trying to convince her parents to let her drop out of school to do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well shoot!&quot; A woman&#39;s voice called from the hall. &quot;Terribly sorry about that class, I just needed to take that call.&quot; It was Ms. Simmon only, waaay better. She was an absolute MILF although she looked younger than she was. 36 years of age with knockers that would knock you out if she turned too quick. It was common practice for boys to ask to use the restroom during class so they could go jack off in the bathroom with her imagine in their heads. Her ass had a tendency of knocking things too... knocking things off her desk that is. She strutted up to the board, her tight pants looking as if it could rip open any moment. She looked to the class, then turned to the board and SMASH! &quot;Oh shoot, not another mug. I swear this desk is waaay too close to the board.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got you a new mug!&quot; One very red boy jolted from his seat holding a &#39;best teacher&#39; mug he had pulled from his backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why thank you Tyler, I appreciated that young man!&quot; All the other boys pulled their hands from their backpacks and shot Tyler dirty looks, mad that they weren&#39;t fast enough with their own mugs. &quot;Alright you cuties,&quot; her long wavy salt and pepper locks framed her well preportioned face &quot;Its Valentine&#39;s Day coming up so I want you all to properly get eachother&#39;s names so we can make eachother some Valentine&#39;s cards ok? So come on out of your seats, lets mingle, we&#39;ll just forget about any lessons today ok?&quot; She winked and smiled at the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok!&quot; The class called back enthusiastically, infected and infatuated with her smile.<br />
<br />
Ms. Simmons&#39; now towering figure swayed on back to her desk, knocked over some papers with her ass and sat back down to do some grading.<br />
<br />
Jeff followed suit collecting names of all his classmates. There were 13 girls and 10 boys and his class so excluding himself and his friends, that would be 20 valentines oh and one for Ms Simmons as well. He first wrote down Anna&#39;s name of course, but to be honest he really didn&#39;t know everyone else&#39;s names, a tad embarrassing perhaps but he usually just focused on his work in this class. The second names he wrote down was for Maria. She was a chunky hispanic girl and not very tall either, only about 4&#39;4&quot; really. She had short greasy black hair and not much in the way of looks, but she was nice and kept to herself. But as Jeff started talking to her it was as if she looked different in this light. She was actually taller than he thought, at least 5&#39;11&quot;. She wasn&#39;t chunky either, she was curvaceous and precocious. Her hair was long and healthy, soft to the touch and wow, she had some serious breasts and a definite case of &quot;high beams&quot; they tented her t-shirt. And was that an accent he was hearing? A thick Columbian accent, he could have sworn she was born here but no biggy. She had the face of a super model but without the fake touch, and she was by no means quiet, she was absolutely bombastic and animated in her movements which only accentuated her thicc ass and tits which jiggled with each motion. He also seemed to have a fixation on standing quite close to Jeff when they were talking, and touching his arms here and there. The more they conversed the more Jeff realized he did know this girl, and before he started dating Alyssa he had a major crush on her. He always thought it was cute when she&#39;d accidentally slip into Spanish when she was passionate about something. He had to move on, talking to Maria felt like cheating on Alyssa. &quot;Well it was nice talking to you Jeff, maybe...&quot; Maria pulled a note from her pocket &quot;We should do it more often?&quot; And with a flick of her wrist handed it to him. Her hands were soft and much larger than his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah... Sure thing Maria.&quot; As he moved to the other side of the room to add more names, he opened the note to see a lipstick stained kiss mark immediately inside with Maria&#39;s phone number inside. When did he get so popular with women? And mainly beautiful women who were way over developed for their age. Infact... Why was this so common? He understood his family, that was just genetics but so many people who aren&#39;t related, that was just weird...<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok and your name?&quot; An indian girl Jeff didn&#39;t know made the first introductions before he could even speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh, Jeff and yours?&quot; He felt unfocused. She looked to be about the same height as him, with deep brown hazel eyes that gleemed in sharp contrast with her darker features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Divya. You hang out with Sophie and company right?&quot; She spoke with an odd formality. As she looked st Jeff she could have sworn they were the same height but must have been mistaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Sophie and Jorge are my best friends.&quot; He replied. No she was definitely taller than him, infact he wasnt even sure she was in his grade now that he thought about it...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s nice Jeffrey. Its good to see you working on the assignment Ms Simmons has given you, carry on. If you have any questions just ask.&quot; Divya or Ms. Khatri walked off, in her heels, her tight business skirt holding on for dear life as her generous assets threatened their very exsistance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you uh... Miss.&quot; What a strange thought? Ms. Khatri was the teacher&#39;s assistant of course, she was in her early twenties if Jeff recalled correctly, and just like Ms. Simmons, she was blessed with massive breasts, hips, and ass. She was very professional but nice once you got past all that. He lost count of how many times he woke up from a wet dream about <br />
her, but who could blame him when she was so hot. Well back to it, he still have 18 more people to work through.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was at the edge of climax for the 5th time in a row. She had caved and called Charles, Daneil, and Jeff&#39;s sister Jamie over to have a four way and she was in heaven. Lucky for her that after interacting with Jeff, Jamie had graduated highschool early due to her high intellect and she had grown even more. An absolute goddess, 7ft of pure sin in such a young package but it was all legal as far as she could see. Jamie had won a court case to be ruled as a legal adult based off of the fact that she was more intelligent than the judge himself, and she was definitely a genius when it came to sex. As much as she loved Charle&#39;s and Daniel&#39;s massive cocks pennitrating her mouth and her ass, it was Jamie&#39;s tongue that was sending her away to bliss. By the time she finally ran out of energy, she had almost forgotten her delima. Part of her didn&#39;t care if she had changed or not, she loved this world she lived in, and as far as she could tell, this is how it always had been. But another side of her felt that it was off, another side wantwd to know the truth. Perhaps after a nap she would know how to proceed...</p>
