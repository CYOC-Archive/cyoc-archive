<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Cleaned up some errors and might flesh out a bit more. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh’s muscular asscheeks bounced as he sauntered to the door.<br />
<br />
I eyed them appreciatively. What if I could do something more extreme? Maybe…I thought of a few fun things I wanted to try on people. Why not test it out on Josh, since he was here?<br />
<br />
“W-wait!” I called.<br />
<br />
The handsome Texan paused and turned, a smirk on his lips. “Got something on your mind, hoss?”<br />
<br />
Shit. How would I get him to stay here long enough for me to change him? I thought quickly.<br />
<br />
“Uh, aren’t you forgetting something?” I said.<br />
<br />
“Forgetting something?” Josh frowned, patting his pockets. “I have my walllet…”<br />
<br />
“Uh, what about your keys?”<br />
<br />
“Got ‘em right here.” Josh grinned, shaking his pocket, making his keys jangle. <br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” I asked, waiting for him to check his pockets again before writing ‘Josh forgot his locker key under his desk’.<br />
<br />
“Well I’ll be!” Josh snorted. “I done forgot mah locker key. Good catch, hoss!”<br />
<br />
I blushed as Josh went searching around the room. Then I shook my head. I needed to concentrate on the change I wanted to make, not on Josh’s bulbous ass and handsome face. I put pen to paper and hesitated. What should I make him into?<br />
<br />
Josh Stanlin…. maybe… Josh Stallion? Bro’s already hung like a horse. Maybe I can make it a bit more literal?<br />
<br />
“Oops, found it!” Josh announced, picking up his key from under his desk and rising up-and bumping his head on the bottom edge of his desk. “Ow! Darn it all!”<br />
<br />
I was running out of time. While Josh was rubbing his shaggy hair, I started writing. ‘Josh Stanlin, my roommate is an anthropomorphic stallion.’ I watched as the notepad glowed briefly before the words sank into the paper.<br />
<br />
“Gosh darn it, now I’m feelin’ all itchy.” Josh snorted rather convincingly.<br />
<br />
I looked up to see Josh rubbing his hair, which was growing longer, the dusty brown color shifting to a dusty gold mane. His other hand was scratching his face, the auburn-colored stubble growing denser and thicker. In fact, all across his body-his arms, hands, what chest I could see-was growing thick and dense. Slowly, his tan skin was crowded out with a dense pelt of reddish colored hide.<br />
<br />
Josh grew taller as he stood up, his spine creaking and cracking as his vertebrae lengthened and tugged him further up. The top of his stretching and warping ears touched the ceiling. They flicked and he shook his head in irritation, his majestic mane flowing back and forth with the movement. <br />
<br />
I watched in fascination as Josh’s face began to extend and elongate. The protrusion of his nose melted and shrank away, merging with his upper lip as his mouth sunk lower. His entire head lengthened as the muscles of his neck thickened to support it. Josh took a deep breath through stretching and flaring nostrils, his chest heaving and swelling within the confines of his shirt.<br />
<br />
His coat was growing dense and glossy. I watched his muscles roll and bulge, growing larger than they had been moments before. Creaks and cracks filled the room as his musculature and skeletal system shifted and adjusted to a bigger, more equine body. His feet adjusted to a digitigrade stance and his toes merged into hooves. <br />
<br />
Josh turned and I could see his backside bulging as a hairy tail sprouted from the base of his spine. Then his crotch shifted and adjust, stretching his jockstrap to its limits. It grew so large, it made his too-tight shorts sag, revealing the straps of his jock and exposing the meaty base of his equine shaft. <br />
<br />
The newly equine Texan settled into his new form, his shirt stretched tight over his massively muscular torso. <br />
<br />
“You alright, roomie?” Josh drawled and clopped heavily over to my side of the room, his fetlocks brushing the floor, and came to a stop in front of me. “I told ya if ya keep starin’, yer gonna make me all hot and bothered.”<br />
<br />
I gulped, looking up at the handsome horse man, my heart fluttering in my chest. He was perfect! The burnished copper hide, the dusty gold mane, his overly-tight shirt and shorts. Josh was…kinda gay looking, actually.<br />
<br />
Flustered, I re-checked my entry into the notebook. <br />
<br />
Nothing I wrote ever indicated turning Josh gay, yet, uh, he was currently standing in front of me, his half-hard junk in my face. As I watched, he unzipped his shorts, letting his fat equine cock flop out. The air was filled with barnyard musk and the smell of sun-warmed hay and sweetgrass.<br />
<br />
“I was gonna go to the gym and workout, get all lathered up, but maybe you can help me out, hoss.” Josh reached down and stroked his massive cock to full hardness. It bobbed seductively in front of my face. Some pre spurted form the tip and splattered against my cheek.<br />
<br />
“Well? It ain’t gonna suck itself.” Josh’s rubbery muzzle curled into a grin. “I know you want it.”<br />
<br />
And I did want it. My mouth watered as I stared at that pulsing shaft. I was mesmerized by it. <br />
<br />
Josh’s hoofletted hand gently pressed against the back of my head, pressing his cock into my mouth.<br />
<br />
The blunt equine tip was hard for me to wrap my mouth around but slid in easily after words. It tasted musky and warm. The veins gently pulsed with the beat of Josh’s horsey heart. Pre trickled acorss my tongue, sweet and sticky like nectar.<br />
<br />
Josh whickered in pleasure. “There ya go, hoss. Try to take as much as ya can.”<br />
<br />
I took more of his black equine cock until the flat head of his dick bumped the back of my throat, making me gag.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright. Ya just ain’t used to it,” Josh said softly, stroking my head, though I could hear the disappointment in his voice.<br />
<br />
Thinking quickly, I surreptitiously took out the notebook, hiding it from his view in my lap, and wrote: ‘I can easily take all of Josh’s cock. I’m a natural at sucking his dick.’. The words glowed for a moment as the ink set in.<br />
<br />
With a gawking noise and a pop, the flared head popped straight down my throat. His hand pressed down insistently and I found inch after inch of hot, musky shaft sliding down my throat. His damp, musky pubic fur rose to greet my nose. I inhaled, my cock hard as I took in his masculine scent.<br />
<br />
I felt my neck muscles thicken and move on their own, sliding against Josh’s equine shaft as I began to suck expertly. Josh whickered and moaned as his hot length, lodged deep in my throat, was massaged by my lengthening orifice. A surge of panic shot through me as I realized the notebook wasn’t just turning me into Josh’s favorite cock-holster, but transforming me into something else entirely. <br />
<br />
My body tingled, my spine cracking and popping as I began to grow taller, Josh’s cock sinking deeper and deeper into my gullet each time it slid out.<br />
<br />
“There ya go sweetheart.” Josh groaned happily. His head rolled back and his hand pressed my face into his crotch in encouragement as I resumed bobbing. “Ya take my dick like a champ.”<br />
<br />
I blushed, bobbing on the hot Texan’s cock, my throat massaging his shaft. My hands, the fingernails of which were darkening and thickening into hooflets, automatically moved, one rolling Josh’s pendulous balls while the other reached around and fingered his puffy anus. Josh rewarded me for my efforts with a delighted moan and a gush of sweet precum down my throat.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, that’s it Kevin,” Josh groaned, “That’s that premium gawk gawk. Fuck… your throat is so tight, hoss!”<br />
<br />
Josh began bucking into my mouth, snorting like a beast. I could feel my body strengthening, muscles piling on top of muscles, my shoulders spreading wide. There was a sudden pressure in my head. Two little nubs pushed out from the side of my expanding cranium. It was uncomfortable, placing a binding pressure on my brain. They lengthened, curving out and forward, my two new horns entering the side of my vision.<br />
<br />
I felt Josh grab onto my horns and earnestly pull on them as he pistoned into me. <br />
<br />
His thrusts were coming fast and hard. Each smack of his crotch into my face seemed to flatten and every time he pulled back, my jaw creaked forward as though trying to keep him inside my throat. Josh fucked my lengthening muzzle like a cocksleeve. I could feel something in my brain shorting out with pleasure, each slam bringing my thoughts to a halt, every time he pulled out, my brain restarting, though slower, thoughts foggier.<br />
<br />
Josh was wordless now, snorting and whinnying in pleasure, pumping his hips like his dick was a piston. Precum poured down my throat, my own snorts and muffled moans of bliss lost amongst my perfect stallion boyfriend’s. His balls smacked my chin rhythmically.<br />
<br />
Then, abruptly, he pulled out, huffing and panting, his rusty hide lathered in sweat.<br />
<br />
The room stank of barnyard musk as I caught my breath. I snorted and shook my much larger, heavier head. I felt something thump on the bed behind me and turned to see a long, bony tasseled tail. I picked it up, feeling it twitch in my massive grip. <br />
<br />
Behind Josh, I could see my reflection in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Staring back at me was a huge, muscular bullman. His hide was black as midnight and he was built like a brick shithouse. His muzzle, while handsome, was brutish, with a lust-addled expression on his face. His eyes were blue and a little dull. As I moved a massive hoofletted hand to scratch my tousled headfur, the fact that it was my reflection fully sank in.  <br />
<br />
I was wearing similar attire as the overly-muscled horse in front of me-sleeveless shirt, tight jean shorts.<br />
<br />
Around us, our room was shifting. Both of our beds had been shoved together and a country song was playing on Josh’s computer. I shifted in place uncomfortably as my underwear transformed into a jockstrap that strained to contain my pendulous tangerine-sized balls.<br />
<br />
Though my thoughts were slower and more sluggish, I still managed to realize that I was transforming into whatever the notebook had decided was ‘someone who was a natural at sucking off an anthro horse’. Apparently, that person was a slutty, yoked anthro bull.<br />
<br />
Josh was pulling off his clothes, kicking them away with his hooves.<br />
<br />
“Come on, hoss, take off those daisy-dukes and spread those legs.” Josh winked. <br />
<br />
I pulled my shirt up over my massive chest, tossing the thin, flimsy material onto the floor and peeled my shorts off my legs. My own hooves were cloven. Taking a moment, I took in the sight of my mountainous form. <br />
<br />
My equipment began to enlarge as I watched. I let out a deep lowing sound as my balls swelled, pumpping an insane amount of testosterone into my body. Coarse hairs curled over my chest and down my thick abs in a trasure trail. I felt my cock jerk, growing longer and redder, tapering to a point as it became bovine. Increasingly muskier precum spurted from the tip of my newly enlarged dick with every inch it grew.<br />
<br />
I laid back in our bed, head spinning with lust and hot testosterone.<br />
<br />
“Let’s see if you’ve been training…” Josh reached beneath me and suddenly I felt something huge straining the ring in my back entrance, thick and hard and rubbery. <br />
<br />
“W-what!” I gasped, breathlessly as I realized how big it was.<br />
<br />
With a little wriggling that had me squirming in pleasure as whatever it was rubbed against my prostate, the object popped free with a *schlop*. <br />
<br />
I watched in amazement and horror as Josh removed a foot-long, girthy horse dildo, slick with lube and stinking of musk. My hole felt empty and the cold air made me try to close my anus, but the muscles must have been stretched so long that they barely even closed. <br />
<br />
“Nice an loose, hoss.” Josh smiled, his hooflet prodding my slack anus.<br />
<br />
I moaned as he played with my hole. My nipples and cock were hard as rocks. Josh continued playing with my rear, bringing his cock back to hardness as he fingered me sensually. I moaned as his hooflets brushed my prostate, his touch electric.<br />
<br />
“That’s my big ole’ heifer.” Josh’s grin was savage, his eyes sparkling in delight. “Give me a moo!”<br />
<br />
“Mrooo!” I lowed in a bassy rumble.<br />
<br />
I spread my legs as Josh played with my bulbous asscheeks. He gently set my tail aside, exposing my winking puckered donut. Josh pressed his flared cockhead against my entrance.<br />
<br />
“Ya like my big quine cock in your hole, huh heifer?” Josh grinned. &quot;Like the song says, save a horse, ride a cowboy.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a grunt, he plunged his flared cockhead into my ass. <br />
<br />
I snorted and kicked my legs as that fat cock stretched my ring tight. Inch after throbbing inch of Josh’s horse shaft slid into me, filling the emptiness that had been there since the dildo was removed. Precum streamed form the tip of my bull dick as it brushed past my g-spot. <br />
<br />
“J-Josh,” I moaned in pleasure and relief, feeling my mate claim me. “Oh! Ngf, fuck!”<br />
<br />
Josh finally bottomed out, his heavy balls slapping against my furry asscheeks.<br />
<br />
Then he started thrusting. Each buck and roll of Josh’s hips sent my massive, muscular ass cheeks rippling. Loud *thwaps* echoed through the room as he fucked me right. I squeezed and clenched around the stallion’s mighty rod.<br />
<br />
Josh snorted and started humping my hungry hole harder.<br />
<br />
I could feel something build within me, a radiant warmth that made my hard cock throb. My mind came to the realization that I was about to have an orgasm. Josh kept thrusting and I felt myself slowly give up as the pleasure never seemed to end.<br />
<br />
“I-I…I’m gonna cum!” I exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Me too,” Josh gasped<br />
<br />
With a whinny of pleasure, Josh slammed his cock deep inside me. Warmth flooded my bowels, dripping around Josh’s cock. Josh slowly fucked his cum in deep, and I felt my own cock erupt, splattering my chest and muzzle in creamy yellowish goodness.<br />
<br />
Josh collapsed on top of me and we lay together our chests heaving. A few moments later, the after glow began to fade. <br />
<br />
“Good fuck, hoss.” Josh smiled<br />
<br />
Josh stood and put his clothes back on.<br />
<br />
I followed suit.<br />
<br />
“Alright, let’s go hit the gym. Gotta maintain those muscles, right sweetheart?” Josh grinned.<br />
<br />
I nodded, my mind a mess of vague memories, and followed him out of the room.</p>
