<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jeff woke up, he was no longer in his mother&#39;s lap. He was lying on his back in his crib. For some reason, he still had some milk in his mouth that tasted kind of weird. He also felt the top part of his onesie was wet. When he touched his face with his hands, he realized it was moist and sticky too, as was the mattress around his head. Slowly, Jeff realized that he had puked in his sleep. He was horrified. Immediately he spit out the rest of the milk in his mouth and started to cry.<br />
Soon, his Dad appeared. &quot;Oh my god! Poor Jeffy, did Mommy forget to burp you again?&quot; he said, laughing, and disappeared from Jeff&#39;s little field of vision again. &quot;I could have suffocated on my vomit and all he does is to laugh!&quot; Jeff thought angrily. The anger made him cry even louder than before. His father returned with a towel and started to wipe the puke out of Jeff&#39;s face. &quot;Shhh, it&#39;s okay. Just let me clean you up.&quot; But Jeff kept crying until his dad had brought him to the changing table and removed his soaked onesie.<br />
His Mommy came into the room. &quot;Is everything alright?&quot; she asked.&quot;He puked a bit&quot; his Dad said. &quot;Poor Baby. Guess I should have burped him, but he was asleep and I didn&#39;t want to wake him up.&quot; his mother said. &quot;Em didn&#39;t puke as much, did she?&quot; his father asked. &quot;Nope. I&#39;ll ask Dr. Bober what she thinks tomorrow.&quot; his Mommy replied. So they had an appointment with Jeff&#39;s old pediatrician. He had always liked her, but sincerely hoped she wouldn&#39;t stick a thermometer up his baby butt. At the moment, said butt was being wiped by his mother while his dad started to clean the crib. Apparently Jeff had pooped in his diaper without even noticing. This was almost as bad as the vomiting, and he felt so embarassed and dirty he was close to crying again - but at least he would be bathed and cleaned now. His Mommy lifted his butt and replaced the poopy diaper with a new one. &quot;Wait, what?&quot; Jeff thought. Mommy continued to dress him and Jeff realized she wanted to leave him this way, with his face and chest all sticky from his vomit. &quot;This can&#39;t be possible. Clean me!&quot; Jeff thought and started to cry as loud as he could, kicking his legs and flailing his arms. But Mommy just buttoned up the onesie in his crotch, put pants and socks on him and then took him up to her shoulder. &quot;What is it, darling?&quot; she cooed, walking around and rocking him slightly. &quot;Are you hungry? You&#39;ve lost a lot of milk, haven&#39;t you? Luckily I have more for you.&quot; To his surprise, Jeff actually felt hungry even though he had just thrown up.<br />
Still he kept crying while Mommy sat down with him in her lap and bared a breast. But as soon as she brought his face close to the nipple, he couldn&#39;t help it - his instincts forced him to suck. The breastfeeding calmed him down again and he enjoyed his mother&#39;s warmth and comfort, but he still felt grossed out and embarassed by his baby body. Also, he wanted to be in control of himself again. He needed to get Emily to change him back - but how?<br />
At that moment, he heard someone coming into the living room. Facing Mommy&#39;s breast, he couldn&#39;t see who it was. &quot;Hi, Mom!&quot; Emily said. &quot;Hi Mary&quot; someone else said to Jeff&#39;s Mommy. &quot;Oh, hi Carla, how are you?&quot; he heard his mother reply. Jeff&#39;s situation had become even worse - Emily had brought her best and most annoying friend with her. Jeff remembered how Carla&#39;s family had moved into the neighborhood while his mother was pregnant with Emily. Carla&#39;s mother had been pregnant too, and the two women had immediately become friends. They&#39;d given birth to their daughters in the same hospital ten days apart, gone to the playground together and later enrolled them in the same school. Now Carla and Emily went to the same ballet course, went swimming together every week and in Jeff&#39;s opinion both of them were incredibly spoiled brats. He just hoped they were going to leave him and Mommy alone now.</p>
