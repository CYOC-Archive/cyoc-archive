<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny decided he needed to stagger the transformation of the nerds as well, probably over the course of the next two weeks, to make it less glaringly obvious. People were already talking a bit about the differences in Terry and Gabe. He didn&#39;t want anyone to think something strange was going on to such a level. So he went ahead and started loading profiles. It was easy enough to do considering Danny went to that school and had a yearbook consisting of the names and faces of the students. He started picking out people from the school to change, making sure he did so in different ways.<br />
<br />
Wouldn&#39;t be good to just change everyone into the same kind of beefcake types. He&#39;d need to make sure there was some variance. So he went ahead and started transformations - some of the nerds getting to become more toned, jacked guys, others becoming more stocky, linebacker types. He needed to fill out the roles considering that most likely Sasha was going to keep going even as her usual lovers ended up no longer quite so into her.<br />
<br />
It was a lot of work, but it was also a lot of fun. The role reversal aspect alone kind of turned Danny on. He was honestly enjoying the idea of taking people who sneered at him behind his back and just giving them what they thought he was like, evidently.<br />
<br />
He was gonna need to check in on some of the nerds at school to see how they were taking to it. As well as checking up on Sam as well. He didn&#39;t care as much about Sam considering he didn&#39;t ever really interact with him, but it should be fun to watch how he took to the change.<br />
<br />
Danny listened in as he heard Jin go up to his room, and once he was done with the changes, Danny locked his computer on a screensaver and then went out to go see. He heard the sound of a shirt hitting the ground, so he thought his brother might be a little more conscious than he might&#39;ve thought...and then as he went he peaked in through the accidentally left slightly ajar door.<br />
<br />
Danny&#39;s eyes widened at what he saw.<br />
<br />
He saw his brother Jin taking stock of his body in just a pair of tighty-whitey underwear, awkwardly flexing and testing out the changes so far to his body. He was evaluating the work Danny&#39;s Chronivac use had already done on his body. Danny stayed stock silent and listened. Jin mused aloud, &quot;Something really is...weird about my body. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything wrong...I mean, this is hardly anything to complain about. But it&#39;s so...weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny expertly concealed a chuckle. Of course bro, he thought to himself, you&#39;re getting buffer.<br />
<br />
Jin started testing out his somewhat brawnier quads, slapping the muscle a few times and openly stating, &quot;Muscle...it&#39;s all muscle I&#39;m putting on...&quot; Danny started to pull away when he saw his brother starting to awkwardly touch at his groin. The last thing he heard his brother say as he quietly tiptoed away was, &quot;...And is it weird I&#39;m so turned on...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny returned to his room and decided he was going to add something to his brother&#39;s changes.<br />
<br />
Thankfully that was an option open to him. He started ramping up his brother&#39;s testosterone levels over the course of a week, eager to see what that would do to Jin during that time frame. Danny knew well enough testosterone didn&#39;t completely change your personality, but it did have effects on how one performed and the way that personality was expressed. So it should be interesting then, to see what going from 5 to 9 on the testosterone scale available on there was going to do to Jin.<br />
<br />
Well, it was about time to start getting ready to head out to the gym. Making sure the screensaver and computer lock were still in place, Danny pulled out a hoodie for his walk, a stringer shirt, and workout pants. He flexed for the mirror and grinned, &quot;Time to show the shrinking jocks what this Asian Adonis is all about.&quot; With that, he strutted downstairs, let his dad know he was heading out to the gym, and headed out with his workout bag.<br />
<br />
Danny was almost too curious to see how Gabe and Terry would&#39;ve changed in the interim. This was after all their second day into a seven day transformation that would completely reshape their identity. Was it one of them who reacted that way to Jackson earlier? It&#39;d be fun to tease them about that.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
As Danny arrived at the gym, he found himself looking at Gabe and Terry waiting for him at the front. Danny had to stop himself from grinning when he saw what the two of them were looking like. Gabe was still the brawnier of the two, by far, but he was definitely thinner than yesterday now, and while it gave him a certain aesthetic and a tight, toned look, it was obvious he was missing the days of him lifting the more obscene weight totals in class. He was wearing a tight white tank top and surprisingly showy shorts.<br />
<br />
Danny wondered if Gabe knew the kinds of signals that could be implied by his outfit.<br />
<br />
But if Gabe was possibly dressing to impress, Terry was DEFINITELY dressing to impress. He had on a mesh racer back stringer shirt, tight pants, and Danny wondered if he put anything on his face before heading out. Because it definitely looked like Terry was taking more care of his face now than ever before. His build was thin, sharp and still muscular, though definitely diminished slightly more. Though obviously, Terry thought he was a dynamo now.<br />
<br />
Even as Danny walked in and Gabe waved hello, Danny could see Terry&#39;s attention divided between greetings and the mirrors on the walls of the gym. Terry was falling in love with himself. And Danny wondered how long it would be before that became &quot;falling in love with men&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Danny started, looking between the two of them, &quot;Sweet gym gear. You two ready to hit the gym?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you know it bro!&quot; Terry responded, &quot;And thanks for noticing! I really picked this stuff out because I think it makes me look amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny concealed his actual reaction of laughter and only nodded, &quot;Yeah man, makes you look uhh, distinctive. You guys up for hitting a full body workout today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe nodded quickly, &quot;Yeah, we gotta get our gains back in. So I think we need to hit it harder today than usual.&quot; And Gabe said that not even knowing going in that he would not put on a pound of muscle today...</p>
