<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cold water splashed against Cam’s chest as he struggled through the lake, Ryder still clinging to his back like a stubborn little monkey. The kid had his arms locked tight around Cam’s neck, legs wrapped around his waist, making it nearly impossible for Cam to move without dragging Ryder along for the ride.<br />
<br />
“You’re going down, Dad!” Ryder crowed triumphantly, laughing as he held on tighter. His grip was surprisingly strong for a kid his size, and every time Cam tried to shake him off, Ryder just squeezed harder. “I’m not letting go!”<br />
<br />
Cam grunted, feeling the weight of Ryder pressing against him, trying to keep the fun going. “Oh yeah? You think you’ve got me beat, huh?” he growled, playing along as he struggled through the water. “We’ll see about that!”<br />
<br />
But as they roughhoused in the water, the playful banter took on a different tone for Cam. The constant pressure of Ryder’s body against him was starting to have an effect—an effect he wasn’t prepared for. The contact between them was closer than Cam was used to, and before he realized what was happening, he could feel the weight of Ryder’s soft cock pressed firmly against his lower back.<br />
<br />
At first, it was just there, like an afterthought. Cam had almost gotten used to the sensation of Ryder’s size earlier, the way his son’s cock seemed to take up more space than it should. But now, with Ryder practically glued to his back, it was impossible to ignore. Ryder’s soft cock—thick and heavy—was pressing right against the base of Cam’s spine, and the more they moved, the more Cam could feel it shifting.<br />
<br />
Cam tried to push the thought away, focusing on the fun, on the laughter, but it was no use. Every time Ryder shifted or bounced, Cam could feel that fat piece of meat pressing into him, thick and solid, brushing against his skin beneath the water. And worse—he could feel it getting harder.<br />
<br />
Shit... is Ryder chubbing up? The thought hit Cam out of nowhere, sending a jolt through him. He didn’t want to believe it, but there was no denying what he was feeling. The playful wrestling, the closeness, it was starting to affect Ryder, too. His soft cock, already impressive in size, was thickening, hardening slightly against Cam’s back. And with each movement, it seemed to press more firmly into him.<br />
<br />
Cam’s breath caught in his throat as he struggled to keep playing along. “Alright, kid... you’re wearing me out,” he said, trying to sound casual as he felt Ryder’s cock thicken against his back. “You’re gonna have to let go soon.”<br />
<br />
But Ryder wasn’t letting go. If anything, he was holding on tighter. His legs squeezed around Cam’s waist, and that’s when Cam felt something else—Ryder’s nuts, bouncing against the top of his ass with every movement. Even with the cold water keeping them tight, they were still huge. Every time Ryder shifted, Cam could feel the weight of those heavy balls knocking against his lower back, high and tight but still big enough to make their presence known.<br />
<br />
Cam gritted his teeth, trying to shake off the sensation, but it was impossible to ignore. Those things are huge, he thought, feeling the unmistakable thud of Ryder’s nuts as they slapped against him. He is so fucking big.<br />
<br />
Ryder, still oblivious to what was happening, just laughed harder. “You’re not getting away!” he shouted, bouncing up and down on Cam’s back, his grip like iron.<br />
<br />
Cam groaned, feeling the pressure building in more ways than one. Ryder’s cock was getting harder, pressing against his spine, and Cam’s own body was starting to respond. He could feel it—the slow, steady rise of his own cock as it swelled beneath the water, reacting to the roughhousing and the constant physical contact. No, no, no... not now, Cam thought, his pulse quickening as he felt himself getting hard.<br />
<br />
The weight of Ryder’s body against his back, the sensation of his son’s cock hardening and his nuts thumping against him—it was too much. Cam’s cock was now fully hard, straining beneath the water, and there was no way to stop it. I’ve got to get out of here, he thought, his heart racing. He couldn’t let Ryder notice.<br />
<br />
“Alright, truce!” Cam said suddenly, his voice a little too loud, a little too strained. “We’re heading back to shore.”<br />
<br />
Ryder, still laughing, just tightened his grip again. “No way! I’m not done with you yet!”<br />
<br />
Cam forced a laugh, his mind racing as he trudged toward the shallows. “You’ve already got me beat, kid. Let’s call it a day.”<br />
<br />
Ryder giggled, bouncing on Cam’s back, completely unaware of what was happening. “Nope! I’m the leech! I’m not letting go until you give up!”<br />
<br />
Cam gritted his teeth, feeling Ryder’s half-hard cock press against him again, the thick shaft growing more prominent with each movement. He had to get out of the water before things got even worse. Come on, almost there, he thought, his steps slow and deliberate as he trudged toward the shore, Ryder still clinging to him like his life depended on it.<br />
<br />
Finally, they reached the shallows, the water now just above Cam’s knees. His cock was fully hard, straining beneath him, and he knew he had to get out of the water fast. Ryder, still latched onto his back, laughed and yanked on Cam’s shoulders, trying to pull him down again.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Dad! You’re not giving up yet, are you?”<br />
<br />
Cam grunted, forcing a smile. “Yeah, I’m done for,” he muttered, trying to keep his voice light. He couldn’t let Ryder see. He had to get out of the water, but with Ryder still clinging to his back, it wasn’t going to be easy.<br />
<br />
Cam had barely managed to collapse onto the sand, his body pressed firmly against the cool shore, when he felt Ryder’s grip loosen. He let out a relieved breath, thinking his son was finally going to let go, but Ryder didn’t roll off like he usually did. Instead, Ryder just sat there on top of him, straddling Cam’s lower back with his legs draped over either side, the weight of him pressing down without the water to help.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Cam froze. Without the buoyancy of the lake, Ryder’s body felt heavy. The difference was immediate. The playful, weightless wrestling they’d been doing in the water was one thing, but now, out here on the shore, the full reality of Ryder’s size hit Cam like a truck. <br />
<br />
Cam’s eyes widened as he felt it. Ryder’s cock, no longer floating in the water, now rested fully against his back, and the sheer weight of it was shocking. It felt like a thick, meaty rope lying across him, covering a good portion of his back, heavier than anything Cam had imagined. Ryder’s legs were on either side of him, and Cam could feel those enormous nuts hanging down, brushing against the top of his ass like two heavy, overfilled sacks. Damn...<br />
<br />
It wasn’t just the size—it was the weight. Without the water, Cam could feel just how massive Ryder’s cock and balls really were. It felt like Ryder’s dick was covering half of Cam’s back, and those bull nuts… The sensation was impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
And Ryder? Ryder was completely oblivious. He sat there, giggling, catching his breath, happy that he’d finally managed to exhaust his dad. His laughter echoed across the beach, carefree and innocent, as if nothing unusual was happening.<br />
<br />
“I told you I’d win!” Ryder said between laughs, his arms now free but his body still perched on top of Cam’s back. He gave a playful bounce, oblivious to the way his weight shifted on Cam, pressing his cock and balls down even harder against him. “You need to get stronger!”<br />
<br />
Cam could only grunt in response, his face still pressed into the sand as he tried to process what was happening.  Ryder just sat there, laughing, enjoying his victory, completely unaware of the weight pressing down on his dad.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright, you won, kid,” Cam said, trying to sound casual while still pressed into the sand. “You gonna get off me now?”<br />
<br />
<br />
Cam lay flat on his stomach, his face half-buried in the sand as he tried to steady his breathing, feeling Ryder still perched on his lower back like a stubborn rider refusing to dismount. Without the buoyancy of the water, Ryder&#39;s full weight pressed down into him, but it wasn’t just his son’s body that Cam was hyper-aware of—it was everything else.<br />
<br />
The soft, lazy weight of Ryder’s cock felt different now, draped across the small of Cam’s back like an anchor, shifting and dragging slightly with each tiny movement Ryder made. Every time Ryder adjusted himself, that fat thing would drag across his skin, swelling subtly as Ryder bounced or wriggled. Cam could feel the length of it stretching farther than it should, pressing firmly against him with no water to lessen the impact.<br />
<br />
Cam could barely keep his focus. The sensation of Ryder’s cock, still soft but undeniably solid, felt like it was covering half his back. Jesus, it feels like a log, Cam thought, trying to stay present in the moment but finding it impossible. As Ryder shifted again, that heavy shaft dragged slowly, almost lazily, across Cam’s lower back, sending a shock of awareness through him.<br />
<br />
And then there were Ryder’s nuts.<br />
<br />
With every playful bounce Ryder made, his balls—their full, rounded weight—shifted too. Cam felt them rest, unmoving for a moment, then dragging across his ass as Ryder shifted his position again, the sensation unmistakable. The way they draped over the top of his ass, rolling with Ryder’s movements, was enough to make Cam’s breath hitch. Ryder’s oblivious laughter rang in his ears, but all Cam could think about was the feeling of those two heavy orbs dragging with every slight shift Ryder made. It was like the kid was completely unaware of what he was packing, and the extra weight was just part of him.<br />
<br />
Cam gritted his teeth, trying to focus on anything but the sensation, but it was impossible. Ryder bounced on his back again, and Cam felt the way Ryder’s cock seemed to swell—not just shift, but press harder into him with each bounce. The sensation of that heavy log of flesh dragging across his skin was impossible to shake. It felt like Ryder’s cock was growing heavier, pressing harder, as if the constant contact was slowly waking something up. And Ryder, completely oblivious, just laughed, bouncing around, adjusting his legs like this was the most natural thing in the world.<br />
<br />
“We’ve gotta catch some big fish today, Dad!” Ryder said, breaking the silence with his excited rambling, completely unaware of the effect he was having. “Bigger than last time! I bet we could catch one that’s, like, this big!” Ryder stretched his arms wide, grinning down at Cam as he imagined their catch.<br />
<br />
Cam barely registered the words. He was too focused on the physical sensations. Ryder’s cock, growing warmer and heavier, felt like it was sinking into his back with every passing second, and his nuts… God, those things weren’t just heavy—they were there, covering the top of Cam’s ass, dragging with each shift Ryder made. Cam’s mind raced as he felt Ryder adjust his position again, causing that solid weight to slide slowly across his skin.<br />
<br />
Ryder kept bouncing, oblivious to the effect. “And after fishing, we can hike up to the lookout! You always say we’ll get there, but we never do!” He giggled, leaning forward slightly, pressing his body further into Cam’s back.<br />
<br />
Cam’s breath caught as Ryder leaned in, causing his cock to press even harder against him, the sensation shifting from a lazy drag to something more deliberate. Cam could feel the thickness of it now—every inch of Ryder’s length felt like it was sinking deeper into the small of his back, almost growing heavier with each shift.<br />
<br />
God, how is it this heavy? Cam’s thoughts raced, feeling every bounce and shift as Ryder’s weight pressed into him. Ryder’s nuts felt even lower now, their heavy mass dragging across his ass, bouncing lightly every time Ryder shifted. The sensation wasn’t just in the weight, but in the way everything moved—every subtle bounce or shift sent a new wave of pressure across Cam’s skin, dragging Ryder’s nuts and cock along with it.<br />
<br />
Cam felt Ryder move again, bouncing lightly, and this time he could feel the shift—Ryder’s cock pressing harder into the dip of his back, his balls sliding over the curve of Cam’s ass. Cam gritted his teeth, trying to focus on Ryder’s excited chatter, but his mind was all over the place. Ryder’s weight was becoming too much to ignore. The sensation of that thick cock sliding across his back, dragging slowly with each movement, was making it harder to stay in control. Shit…<br />
<br />
“And maybe after the hike, we can come back and swim again!” Ryder was still talking, bouncing gently on Cam’s back as he rambled on about the day’s plans. He seemed totally unaware of the effect he was having, his laughter light and easy as he went on. “And then tonight, we’ll roast marshmallows and look at the stars again, right? You promised!”<br />
<br />
Cam grunted, feeling the weight shift once more as Ryder leaned back, his legs pressing against Cam’s sides. “Yeah, sure, bud,” Cam muttered, trying to keep his voice steady. “Just... give me a sec here.”<br />
<br />
But Ryder wasn’t giving him a break. Instead, he adjusted his position again, bouncing lightly as he talked. Cam felt that thick, soft cock drag lower on his back, pressing into him with even more weight. His nuts, which had been draped over Cam’s ass, shifted too, sliding against his skin like they were almost trying to settle in. The drag of it all was driving Cam insane. It wasn’t just the size—it was the movement. The way Ryder’s cock and balls moved with every bounce, sliding and pressing, was too much to ignore.<br />
<br />
Finally, Cam couldn’t take it anymore. He needed to get up, to shake this off before he lost control completely.<br />
<br />
With a groan, Cam forced himself to his knees, feeling the weight of Ryder’s cock and balls slide off his back as he pushed himself up. The sensation of everything sliding was almost worse than when Ryder was sitting still. Cam could feel the slow drag of Ryder’s cock as it slid down his back, and the heavy thud of Ryder’s nuts as they slipped off the top of his ass. The movement was slow and deliberate, the weight impossible to miss.<br />
<br />
Cam sat up, taking a deep breath as Ryder finally hopped off his back and stood beside him, laughing and grinning like nothing was wrong. “I told you I’d win, Dad! You’re getting slow!” Ryder teased, completely oblivious to the tension simmering inside Cam.<br />
<br />
Cam forced a weak smile, his heart still racing from the sensation of Ryder’s body pressing into him. “Yeah, you got me,” he muttered, trying to shake off the lingering feeling of that heavy weight sliding off him.<br />
<br />
Ryder stretched, looking back at the lake. “Come on, Dad! Let’s go fishing! We’ve got so much to do today!”<br />
<br />
Cam nodded, still trying to catch his breath. “Yeah… yeah, let’s do that,” he muttered, grateful that Ryder hadn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary. But as he stood up, the memory of Ryder’s weight—his cock, his balls—still lingered, heavy in Cam’s mind.</p>
