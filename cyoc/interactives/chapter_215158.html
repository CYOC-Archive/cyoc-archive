<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I&#39;ve always wondered what it would be like to have a piercing, Erin thought to herself as she made the edit.<br />
<br />
She changed &quot;semen&quot; to &quot;piercings&quot; and she confirmed the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin finds it difficult to speak with piercings in her mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something cold and metal forced her mouth open. Looking down she could even see it past her nose, it was a giant metal ring. She brought a hand up to explore it - from her lips it curved down, it had a fixed bead farthest away from her chin, and it curved back up and through the jaw . She had just given herself a giant prince albert. Technically it was a mandible piercing, but she was part dick. The wire was larger around than her thumb. She discovered her tongue was weighted down by a really fat pair of barbells when she went to feel around where the ring pierced her from the inside.<br />
<br />
With her hands, she explored the ring pierced her chin: there wasn&#39;t actually a 0000 gauge hole through the floor of her mouth. The ring thinned down to some smaller size that she couldn&#39;t discern.<br />
<br />
She found that she could play with the ring by moving it around with her lips and tongue. She could turn it side to side and tilt it up and down. She could also tap her tongue piercing against the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;So whad are your blans for draining dis?&quot; Erin asked Trish, referring to the 1&quot; deep pool of cum she was suspended above.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that thing makes you difficult to understand, right? Anyway, I ordered a portable pump after our first night back. We&#39;ll run a hose out to the pool room, then I can finish showering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m a dick now aren&#39;d I? I have to dress the bard&quot; Erin retorted. She found she was more intelligible with the ring pushed to one side of her mouth, but it was difficult to keep there.<br />
<br />
Trish shifted her weight and lifted her left foreleg, rinsing off the cum with her own wand. Once it was rinsed, she pushed open the glass door and set hoof on the mat outside the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you get my hindlegs?&quot; Trish asked. and lifted her left one. The shower wand was not spared as she had left it on the ground before their climax. Once her phone was tucked into her sheath, Erin grabbed the wand and scraped off the semen as best she could, but there was still a layer she couldn&#39;t remove on it and on her hands. She knew the sooner they got the shower drained the sooner she could wash it off, so she just dealt with it. She sprayed the offered hoof off as best she could and shouted up that she was done. Trish and Erin repeated the dance for the next two and Trish was completely out of the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Waid, my hands are sdill covered,&quot; Erin called up, hoping to flick dry them or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will only take a few minutes, you can clean them after.&quot; Trish replied while walking them out of the bathroom and back toward the pool room.<br />
<br />
This didn&#39;t suit Erin, who chose to wipe them off on some green hairs above her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just wipe your hands off on me? You&#39;re such a dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guildy!&quot; Erin retorted and giggled, sticking out her tongue even though Trish couldn&#39;t see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, well you&#39;re helping me clean my barrel.&quot;<br />
Erin silently acquiesced and grabbed her cell phone. Checking instagram, her post from earlier this morning had gotten some likes. Switching back to the OneWord app, she generated a sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;The centaur is getting a pump to suck up all the semen.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Trish was about to enter the breezeway to go to the pool room, Erin confirmed her modified sentence which read, &quot;The centaur is getting a maid to suck up all the semen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reality jumped and they were back in the steamy bathroom. Trish was now speaking into some kind of intercom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda, please come to the main shower, we have need of your services.&quot; <br />
<br />
A voice from the intercom replied, &quot;right away! Should I bring anything?&quot; Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t be necessary, just you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. I will be right there,&quot; Miranda excused herself and Trish moved away from the panel so she would have access to the flooded shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t out to meet Miranda when I hired her. Her natural mutation will assist us,&quot; Trish explained to Erin.<br />
<br />
Soon, Miranda arrived wearing black slacks and a black oversized buttoned blouse that wasn&#39;t tucked in. &quot;I&#39;m here boss,&quot; she said, waiting for her assignment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to continue showering, would you please move this to the pool?&quot; Trish ordered, pointing at the cum-filled basin.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you say,&quot; the maid acknowledged and unbuttoned the bottom buttons of her blouse while stepping over to the shower. She got on her hands and knees and put her lips to the white fluid.<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to happen for a few moments until Erin noticed Miranda&#39;s stomach was inflating. Erin realized the phone had created a maid who would literally suck up all the cum. Erin watched mesmerized as the belly got bigger and bigger. One hand started to run circles on her belly while the other generated a new sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;The maid&#39;s stomach can suck in and store fluids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin knew exactly what to do and changed &quot;stomach&quot; to &quot;breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fastened buttons of Miranda&#39;s blouse traded with the unbuttoned ones as her stomach flattened and boobs swelled up and out of the blouse. They continued to do so as the cum got sucked up.<br />
<br />
By the time her breasts were as big as beachballs, the cum had been all but sucked up. When she stood up Erin could see the breasts slosh quite heavily from the fluid inside. Miranda reached in and turned back on the water, using the shower wand to chase the leftover semen down the drain. Picking up the cum-soaked stick sponge she threw it in the trash.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is finished,&quot; she concluded and gestured to the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you miranda, once you&#39;ve emptied that, would you like to go with us to the beach?&quot; Trish asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I would, thank you boss,&quot; Miranda accepted then left, having to go sideways through the door thanks to her cum-filled breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad she won&#39;t stay on full time,&quot; Trish mused when the maid was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is dat?&quot; Erin asked her. Apparently having not met the maid before, she couldn&#39;t rely on recalling new memories.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is a talented and popular saxophonist. If she was here full time we could simply have you and her lock lips when we cum. That would free up the pool for swimming again,&quot; Trish said as she stepped back into the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sacksofone? Dat is an unusual insdrumend. Trish handed down a bottle of shampoo and Erin grabbed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;She explained it to me that her mutation caused her high school band teacher to put her on tuba, that her air capacity gives her a leg up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dat would ecksblain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I need you to get as much of my barrel as you can,&quot; Trish instructed and turned the water back on.<br />
<br />
Seeing nothing else better to do, Erin put the phone down and got to rubbing in the soap with her hands. It gave her a mild buzz to do it but she didn&#39;t think anything would happen if she continued. Soon the entire rainbow barrel had been lathered up and the cum she wiped on it earlier was long gone down the drain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait for me to start rinsing before you do,&quot; Trish asked and with nothing better to do, Erin went back to her phone.<br />
<br />
She recorded a quick video of the water falling down Trish&#39;s centaur breast before whipping the camera around to catch her face in a pout. The look was somewhat obfuscated by her prince albert. That video went up as &quot;what I have to deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon Trish has finished what she was doing and water started to pour over her sides and run down her barrel as before. Erin got a video of this to post at a later date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you can start rinsing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin proceeded to rinse off all the suds. She could tell the water heater was nearing capacity as the temperature of the water started to drop, causing her to inadvertently shrink back slightly into her sheath.<br />
<br />
Still, her job wasn&#39;t yet over so she kept on rinsing. Now she had to get the part right above her length. It was very uncomfortable as the cool water splashed over her, and she found herself receding even more.<br />
<br />
She continued to rinse as she was sucked back, before finally letting go lest she bring the wand inside with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I need you to brush too,&quot; Trish said when she realized what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal wid id yourself, I&#39;m cold,&quot; Erin complained and then she was fully enclosed.</p>
