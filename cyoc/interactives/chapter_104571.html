<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben and Kenya greatly enjoyed their meal and their conversation with been sharing a great deal about his day and what Frances had been able to share with him about his own family past. At times she felt like he was on a great adventure and was discovering things for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds as though you have learned a lot, my werewolf,&quot; Kenya commented with a soft smile, &quot;I trust all has been pleasing and to your acceptance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Ben answered with a smile, &quot;A lot of it sorta feels sort a like my moms were simply being quiet about it until they felt I was ready or were waiting for the right words to say it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they were afraid you wouldn&#39;t love them for not raising you with pictures and memories of your birth parents at every turn,&quot; Kenya commented, &quot;after all... you are a junior in high school. Surely that is old enough to understand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is... but you saw the picture of them as college students,&quot; Ben answered, &quot;My moms and my biological parents were good friends. I&#39;m sure that there isn&#39;t anything bad about how did things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is good, then,&quot; Kenya nodded, &quot;especially with the pleasure you&#39;ve had in learning about your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben shrugged and scratched the back of his head a bit nervously and then nodded. He had enjoyed finding out more about his biological parents and how all that would relate to his own future. However, for the moment, he&#39;d hoped that the night would be more focused on him and Kenya. A part of him owed her a lot for helping him, particularly with regard to learning more about his mother&#39;s past at least, but that wasn&#39;t the thing that was really on his mind. It was more that he wished to give Kenya a good time and let their own bonds continue to grow. Kenya, however, noticed that he didn&#39;t answer right away and figured that his lack of an answer wasn&#39;t entirely successful.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are pleased with that, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Kenya asked, &quot;as family is important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I am pleased,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;and I will look forward to learning more...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then slowly reached out to touch Kenya&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wanted to give you a good evening and have some fun,&quot; Ben told her as he softly rubbed her hand with his thumb.<br />
<br />
Kenya gave a very understanding smile, &quot;It is fun just learn about you and help you learn about me. It&#39;ll help build the loving relationship that is growing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben noticed that her smile didn&#39;t fade, even as he fished the pie that was presently on his plate for dessert. A slight glint in her eye made him think that there was something rather playful in the way Kenya looked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides,&quot; Kenya said with a smile, &quot;curfew isn&#39;t as a big of an issue tonight. We have plenty of time for some REAL fun, my werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben did smile at that. While he and Kenya had taken their time, partially to make sure things were OK regarding their different ages, their time together the day and night before actually felt better than anything Ben had experienced before. Maybe it was something related to things being more personal than just a random pack orgy. With their plates empty and a small ticket indicating the price of their meal on the table beside Ben&#39;s glass, the two stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suppose we should depart,&quot; Ben commented and then reached for the check.<br />
<br />
Ben collected it and the two of them prepared to head to the main cashier&#39;s area, only run into a bit of a surprise. Ben and Kenya managed to come to a stop to avoid running into Melissa Stovall as she lead Julie and Eric in the same direction. The two youngsters walked arm in arm, their eyes locked on each other. Though, Eric&#39;s eyes looked to be a remarkably bright shade of blue and at the same time, Julie was fingering a pearl necklace with a single pearl on it. That was a bit surprising, but the bigger thing was the scent that hit Ben&#39;s nose. Eric&#39;s wasn&#39;t a normal human&#39;s. His scent carried a slightly fishy tinge to it, just as Melissa&#39;s and Julie&#39;s did, though theirs was also mixed with a tinge of perfume so that Moon Lake&#39;s weres weren&#39;t getting a nose full of fish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Ben spoke, to be polite and to hopefully start a conversation that didn&#39;t come off as sounding too surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... hi, Ben,&quot; Eric spoke with a friendly smile and for the first time NOT looking to Julie, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you were here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I had a date,&quot; Ben replied, &quot;Eric Anderson, Melissa and Julie Stovall, this is my girlfriend, Kenya Adaeze.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa and Julie both paused and looked to Kenya, who looked on. She knew that Eric was a &quot;friend&quot; and &quot;neighbor&quot; to Ben, but she really didn&#39;t know Melissa or Julie. She&#39;d heard her aunt and uncle mention a Martin Stovall from time to time but the two female names were unfamiliar to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a pleasure to meet you,&quot; Kenya said politely.<br />
<br />
Eric nodded. Melissa smiled politely and let Eric and Julie hold hands and look to Ben and his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a date, too,&quot; Eric held Julie&#39;s hand and gave it a friendly squeeze. &quot;Mostly to celebrate some changes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You became a weremer,&quot; Ben noted.<br />
<br />
Eric smiled and looked to Julie again.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be with my one true love,&quot; Eric answered.<br />
<br />
Ben watched as Julie gave an equally love-sick smile. He couldn&#39;t help but give them both a smile as well. Eric had probably been the most frightened and nervous about the things that made up Moon Lake and its were population. Some of it might be understandable given how his father had joined were society and the rough patch that William and Martha had gone through before moving to Moon Lake. Now, though, Eric had not only joined were society as well but had found love as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you well, then,&quot; Ben commented, &quot;hopefully you and Julie have many happy years together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully we will,&quot; Eric and Julie both agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And hopefully, you and your girlfriend have a good night as well,&quot; Eric smiled to Ben sliding his arm around Julie to hold his girlfriend/fiance close to him.<br />
<br />
Ben nodded to that.</p>
