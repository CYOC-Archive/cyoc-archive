<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It&#39;s a shame they could only give us regular rooms,&quot; Roger commented to Roland as they sat in a pair of comfortable chairs in the lounge of the hotel they had booked for their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
Both were relatively impressed with Hawaii so far, though it wasn&#39;t much more than a first look. To a degree, Roger agreed with Sophie and Roland when they&#39;d been discussing the ideas on destinations. When they&#39;d been heavily active in Animalia Ambassadoria coverage of new colonies or new events on existing ones had often made for a fair number of spots that were well familiar to them. They&#39;d been to Mieni a fair number of times, and while things like the small island in that atoll which was set up where clothing was optional and there were areas &quot;secluded&quot; enough that sex on that island wasn&#39;t out of the question all made for attractive destinations, they were things they all knew about already. While Hawaii had some things that were fairly similar to Mieni in certain ways, there were also things that were very different and very new. Not to mention the size of the island they flew to was impressive to Roger.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d checked in and moved their luggage to their rooms, which to their surprise were fairly standard rooms and were actually next to each other. It wasn&#39;t what Roger expected, but since the trip had been paid for by Sophie and Roland winning the Year of the Dragon tournament he wasn&#39;t going to complain.  Though, while they waited for Sophie and Jessica to finish freshening up for the next item on the agenda for the evening, that wasn&#39;t going to necessarily stop him from voicing his opinion on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... and I am with you on that,&quot; Roland nodded his beak, &quot;I was hoping for one of the honeymoon suites, but the agreements that were arranged for payment from winning the Year of the Dragon tournament didn&#39;t have honeymoons in mind. And some of that makes sense. Had Rex and Tyra won... they are ALREADY married and wouldn&#39;t need a honeymoon suite. And while the hotel would have accepted a transfer TOO those suites when I called for the reservations, they wouldn&#39;t transfer the payment from the tournament win over to them. So... I just had to accept that. It might give us more room for souvenirs to buy that commemorate the visit... photos, something Hawaiian. That&#39;d be good right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Roger nodded, &quot;that something you planned for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s something I considered and talked over with Sophie before setting things up,&quot; Roland admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know,&quot; Roger nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... it is,&quot; came Jessica&#39;s voice, making both Roger and Roland look up, &quot;Mr. Lightfoot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger smiled to her. Jessica was wearing light blue dress that came down to her knees and had a white belt that hung on her hips. The dress was semi-open but was largely framed by the red tresses that was her hair. She looked amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Lightfoot,&quot; Roger said to her.<br />
<br />
Roland was quick to get to his feet as Sophie followed Jessica. Sophie wore a khaki-colored skirt with a button-down shirt that had a soft floral print to it. The shirt was open backed, but that was for the obvious need to accommodate her wings. Roland&#39;s own light green shirt had a similarly open back. The two hugged and nuzzled their beaks together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t keep you waiting too long, did I?&quot; Sophie asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not, Mrs. Luwrie,&quot; Roland said back to her.<br />
<br />
Sophie only answered with a low chirp and nuzzled her crest against Roland&#39;s before looking over to Roger and Jessica, &quot;so what do you two have planned for the evening? It&#39;s probably a bit late for swimming or some of the scenic things... but there is a sort of bistro that goes by the beach not to far from here that has some interesting looking restaurants with them. Roland and I were thinking on what they&#39;d have for fish and seeing some of the night life...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On some other night... we may join you,&quot; Jessica commented, &quot;so... keep an eye on their menus, see if they have anything vegetarian or pasta related. For tonight, I think we&#39;ll just go to a more basic restaurant... though we may scout out other locations to see if there are any places that might be worth splurging on...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The walk was rather pleasant for Sophie and Roland. They had to keep their wings cloaked, but that was generally something that they&#39;d long accepted, and it wasn&#39;t just because Hawaii wasn&#39;t an Animalian colony. Even in Lyre/Animalia or at times when they visited Dino City it would make sense to have their wings cloaked so as not to give others any problems with space or risk injury to the wing membranes. In this, walking along the boardwalk simply had them practicing skills they&#39;d had to learn and master ever since they became Dinotopians after their sophomore year in High School. This also included wearing a pair of sandals on their feet. Though, the sandals were more to follow many of the rules that was often there in areas that were more Human dominated.<br />
<br />
For Animalians could often handle a great many things barefoot. They either had a strong thick pad on their feet that would protect and cushion them or the nature of their foot was flexible enough that certain things that a Human couldn&#39;t walk through barefoot wouldn&#39;t trouble an Animalian, as much. Some of the Animalians that had hooves, like Abbey and Samson, could stand on hooves and thus had a hard surface that would touch the ground. However, there were some issues where a hooved Animalian could present some trouble, such as on tile that was hoped to not be scuffed up and was why Abby and Samson had specialized rubber &quot;shoes&quot; that fit around the outside of the hooves, and served to protect them in ways similar to normal horseshoes and could also be taken off and on without the use of nails. There could be the additional risks that came with certain things, particularly in areas where garbage and polluted substances were possible hazards, which had made for a unique and impressive sandal market for Animalians to work with their different foot types.<br />
<br />
This also applied for areas where it wasn&#39;t an Animalian colony or something where there was a lot of open acceptance of Animalian culture. This meant that many places that were Human run that had a &quot;no shirt, no shoes, no service&quot; sort of policy applied. That was what had Sophie and Roland wearing their sandals as they walked along the boardwalk and taking in some of the sites around the area. It was close to one of the beaches and they could hear the ocean surf, though right now it was probably too late for swimming. There were also various electric lights and lamps that lit up some shop fronts that were on their right. Many of them looked to be little beach side restaurants, and from what both Pterodactylus Dinotopians could smell, they did a fair amount of grilling as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;The scent of the grills is all making me hungry,&quot; Sophie commented, &quot;it&#39;s like there&#39;s a mix of beef, pork, and fish all mixing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t eat ALL that in one sitting,&quot; Roland teased and then ducked as Sophie threw a playful punch at him, &quot;but yeah... and a lot of the atmosphere out here is pretty good. Folks have been friendly and not overly friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sophie agreed, thinking on some of their start at SMU where there was a fair amount of their classmates that had watched Animalia Ambassadoria and were fans of the series. It wasn&#39;t as though people &quot;fan-girled&quot; over them, but there were sometimes, particularly in their freshman year where Animalia Ambassadoria seemed to be the main subject of conversation. Sophie liked that people liked the show, but at the same time, that wasn&#39;t all she wanted to be known for. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re a normal couple on their honeymoon... Though, which one do you think we should go to for dinner tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
“If I may make a suggestion, try the Flaming Kahuna, over there,” came a male voice from their side, “they have late hours, they serve just about everything, are good with tourists looking to sample native Hawaiian dishes, and they’re good with anything grilled.”<br />
<br />
Sophie and Roland both turned to see two Shark Animalians standing there. They were both converted Humans, as they had their hair, and the female&#39;s dorsal fin standing up through her hair as she stood there. Though there were some other differences from the other Shark Animalians that they had met. Ran and Gaz as Great White Shark Animalians had a more pointed muzzle and the couple of Bull Shark Animalians also had their muzzles come forward to a more rounded point. These two, however, had a flatter front to their muzzle. A small smile from the female also indicated that their teeth had a different shape from the triangular teeth that Ran and Gaz had.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re from the original Animalia Ambassadoria cast, right?&quot; the male asked, &quot;the ones that won the Year of the Dragon contest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sophie said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then welcome to Hawaii,&quot; the male gave a strong smile, &quot;aloha. I&#39;m Haku and this is my bond-mate/girlfriend, Finola.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haku...&quot; Roland said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m from Hawaii originally,&quot; Haku answered, &quot;and in my conversion... I went with a species that is often placed with some degree of spiritual reverence for my people... the Tiger Shark.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I went with it because the Tiger Shark has had the reputation of being more than just grey and white the way so many other sharks are,&quot; Finola added, &quot;though... it&#39;s a shame that the pups lose their stripes as they mature. Thankfully, Haku is great with tattoos... and unlike mammals that have a lot of fur that would cover up a tattoo, sharks have scaled skin...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though the roughness of it makes it hard to tattoo,&quot; Haku answered, &quot;but I&#39;ve found ways to make it work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you live here?&quot; Roland wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We spend time between here and Mieni,&quot; Haku answered, &quot;a lot of our work and jobs are here... but we&#39;ll vacation at Mieni. To get away from various pressures and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it works well... Haku has his tattoo parlor and I&#39;ve gotten the licensing to do some dive tours in places,&quot; Finola gave a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s all good,&quot; Sophie spoke, &quot;we&#39;re only here for our honeymoon. You said the Flaming Kahuna was the place to go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Haku nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know... would they serve anything that would do well for an herbivorous diet?&quot; Roland wondered, &quot;Roger and Jessica came along with us... for their honeymoon... and well... Rabbit Animalians aren&#39;t meat eaters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They do serve soups and salads... though, they aren&#39;t their main menu items,&quot; Haku answered, &quot;and we wouldn&#39;t really know on the size or how good... as well... Tiger Sharks aren&#39;t known for eating plants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And tell your friends congratulations on their marriage,&quot; Finola added, &quot;may it be long and happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sophie smiled, &quot;and we will.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, both Pterodactylus Dinotopians moved to the restaurant the two Tiger Sharks had suggested.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was a bit late when Roger and Jessica returned to their room. The restaurant they had dinner at ultimately proved to be further from the hotel than they expected, but they&#39;d had a good meal and the atmosphere had been pleasant. There wasn&#39;t any displeasure their plans for the evening or anything of that nature. While they could have gone with Sophie and Roland, there was the recognition that it was their honeymoon and that much of their decision to travel with Sophie and Roland included not just doing something different from all that they&#39;d done with Animalia Ambassadoria in the past but also playing to the fact that by winning the Year of the Dragon contest, Sophie and Roland had won a very good deal on the travel, and made things financially easier for them and their parents.<br />
<br />
But all of that still had things that would be separate from Sophie and Roland. There were some things that the two couples would do together, as they were still friends, but that didn&#39;t change that they all had different desires and different plans. It&#39;d thus make sense to have at least some things that would be separate from Sophie and Roland&#39;s plans. Jessica knew that the two Pterodactyls were looking at some swimming or diving tours. While swimming on the beach wouldn&#39;t be too bad, Jessica and Roger were more interested in seeing some of the areas where they could stop to smell the flowers and see some of the views. The biggest group event was getting a helicopter ride that would take them to one of the high points on the island that had been set up as a tourist&#39;s observation point. People could see a large portion of the island and the sea beyond.<br />
<br />
For the immediate moment, though, the thing that sat in the back of Jessica&#39;s mind was another aspect of a honeymoon that she wouldn&#39;t necessarily want Sophie there for... at least so far as she and Roger were concerned. Jessica was also privately certain that Sophie wouldn&#39;t want her there with Roland. Though, this was, of course, where some of the wishes for a more &quot;honeymoon suite&quot; would have been preferred. The room only had one bed, and it was easily big enough for two, but it was about the same average size as any hotel room with a chair and a small table by the window with its dark blue curtains framing the window. There was a long but low table/cabinet on which stood a decent sized flat-screen television. A basic bathroom was just on the inside of the main door to the hotel room and had a small closet space before one would get to the main part of the room. The carpet was soft and not gaudy, but it all reinforced the simpler nature of the room, and one that did have some worries for other issues.<br />
<br />
Some of those other issues came as Jessica&#39;s ears picked up a soft moan come through the wall behind the bed&#39;s headboard. It was faint and barely audible, and if Jessica and Roger were both Human, they probably wouldn&#39;t have heard anything, but as Rabbit Animalians, their ears were not for show.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Sophie and Roland are having a good time,&quot; Jessica commented as she kicked off her sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is her honeymoon,&quot; Roger said to her and came up behind her and was soon massaging her shoulders and leaning down with his head and neck to softly &quot;nibble&quot; at Jessica&#39;s neck, though it came more to would be felt more like grooming than anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jessica nodded, &quot;and we are on ours. What say we have a good time too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judging by the growing scent of arousal from Roger, Jessica could already get an answer to that. To a great degree, it was also something she was looking forward to. As it was her honeymoon and she was with her bond-mate, and who she&#39;d had plenty of sex with since her eighteenth birthday, now more than four years ago. She then reached down with one hand grope Roger&#39;s stiffening penis through his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good,&quot; Roger answered as he wrapped one arm around Jessica and cupped her left breast while his penis continued make his khaki shorts feel tighter and thought he heard a squawking moan come faintly through the wall of Sophie demanding Roland go &quot;harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica pulled away a bit and turned to face her husband, with one hand moving to unbuckle the belt that hung from her hips. She flashed him her most seductive smile while keeping her ears standing erect on her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure I look good too, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Jessica teased as the buckle on the belt opened and she let it fall to the floor. From there, her hands then drifted down toward her knees and gently gripping at the bottom of her dress.<br />
<br />
Roger could only watch as the soft light blue fabric was lifted up, revealing more of Jessica&#39;s long, toned, white furred legs. She didn&#39;t have the bulk muscle that Abby had, but Roger could always tell that Jessica had good muscle tone and when added to her digitigrade feet and generous hips as an adult Animalian, he couldn&#39;t help but feel his heart pound as he looked to her legs. Particularly as Jessica continued to smile to him, and as her black panties were revealed, that was enough for him to undo the button and zipper on his shorts, which was getting a bit tighter as his penis grew more erect and formed a noticeable bulge. It also seemed to further arouse Jessica, judging by her scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good does not even begin to describe how you look,&quot; Roger managed as Jessica had pulled her dress up enough that her black E cup bra was visible, &quot;you&#39;re the most beautiful bunny I&#39;ll ever know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica tossed her dress down onto the floor and feeling her long red hair flop back down along the sides of her head and down her back. Her smile remained as she climbed up onto the bed as she saw Roger push his shorts down and allowing the noticeable bulge in his boxers be even more visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are the most handsome rabbit I know,&quot; Jessica&#39;s smile remained as Roger moved up to the bed and she reached forward to begin undoing the buttons on his shirt, still faintly hearing the sounds of Sophie and Roland&#39;s lovemaking come through the wall. In its own way, it seemed to add to her own arousal as her mind drifted ever more to knowledge at what was to come. As she could also feel Roger&#39;s well sculpted muscles underneath his brown fur with the back of her fingers. &quot;And we make a great pair for other reasons...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given your taste in movies, I&#39;m guessing that relates to our first names,&quot; Roger answered as he slid out of his shirt and moved to kiss Jessica&#39;s nose, and which soon turned into a series of kisses and soft nibbles that went down the side of her neck and raised a small moan from her as well.<br />
<br />
It also gave Roger the opportunity to scoot forward and undo the clasps on Jessica&#39;s bra, which soon joined her dress and Roger&#39;s shirt on the floor. It left Jessica&#39;s generous bosom to bounce freely and with nipples stand erect through her white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know me so well,&quot; Jessica managed through a fairly husky moan as Roger&#39;s kisses moved from her neck and then down onto her breasts, sending tremors of pleasure, or coming pleasure, as he did so. <br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t say any more as Roger&#39;s lips moved around her right nipple and gently squeezed on it. His teeth never touched it, it was just Roger&#39;s lips, which were soft yet firm and covered in his soft brown fur. It both tickled and teased her a bit and gave Roger a small sampling of Jessica&#39;s milk. It left Jessica moaning as she pressed down on the bed with her feet to raise her hips up. She managed to get her thumbs on the side of her hips and began to slide her panties down, and soon got help in that regard. Rogers kisses gradually moved down from her breasts to her belly and then toward her vagina and clit. It finished as Roger placed one arm under her waist and lifted her up and letting her legs stay &quot;closed&quot; enough to make pulling down her panties easier. He got one leg out easily, though Jessica then kicked to a side with the other leg and sent her panties flying through the air and landing somewhere on the floor. She wasn&#39;t paying attention as to where...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Roger agreed, &quot;and I know something else you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessica only paused and then gasped as Rogers lips gently nipped at her clit as grew ever more ready for what was to come and was soon followed by his tongue licking at it and then going into her. It did feel good and brought a pleasure filled moan to Jessica&#39;s lips. She barely noticed Roger reaching back with one hand to pull down his own boxers and then kick them off with one foot. The attention to foreplay did feel good and Jessica did like it, particularly as the more Roger licked and nibbled, the better things felt and the wetter she became. She managed to cup her own breasts as Roger progressed as a pleasure filled quiver began to build in her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Ro..gg..errr... I looooOOOOve tha...at,&quot; Jessica moaned out as she came, &quot;please Roger... I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger only smiled back while licking Jessica&#39;s cum from his muzzle. As he got up and moved forward, he gave Jessica a full view of his erect penis standing at full attention. He saw Jessica smile at that heard another faint call of &quot;harder&quot; come through the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Roger said to her, &quot;as I suspect we&#39;ll have to catch up with Sophie and Roland...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them... ohhhh....&quot; Jessica moaned out as Roger began to enter her and feeling her vagina stretch and wrap around his penis. It was enough to make her thrust her hips forward and get him ALL the way into her. &quot;Let them have their fun. You and I both know that bunny sex is the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That it is,&quot; Roger answered as he began to piston his penis forward and back as Jessica matched his thrusts with thrusts of her own. It felt good and Roger did his best to also caress Jessica&#39;s breasts as they bounced as the pair of them thrust their hips forward and back, along with kissing her as best as their Lapine muzzles would allow. Roger was presently in heaven and not much else mattered.</p>
