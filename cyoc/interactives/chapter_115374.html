<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Dana suddenly reached in the bag and grabbed a handful of the food.  She pulled it out and stuffed it into her mouth, chewing loudly.  She stopped after the first bite, and got a strange look on her face.  Rick thought she was going to spit it out.  But then she smiled and continued chewing merrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! That&#39;s mine!&quot; said Rick angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore.  Finders keepers.  Besides, I thought you were sick.  Don&#39;t you need to run to the bathroom? &quot; teased Dana.<br />
<br />
Rick flushed.  Or he thought he flushed.  He whole face felt warm and tingly, even his ears.  He couldn&#39;t let Dana see him change.  He would just have to get the bag later, when the size difference between them wasn&#39;t so great.  Hell, she would probably dump the stuff when she realized what it was doing to her.<br />
<br />
Rick watched her take the bag to the living room and plop down on the couch, turning on the TV.  Defeated, Rick retreated to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, Rick assessed the damage.  He still looked mostly human, but his canine features were impossible to ignore.  His hands were paws, and after he slipped off his shoes he saw that his feet were, too.  A thin mixture of white and brown fuzz covered his body, the beginning of his fur coat.  His ears sat on the top of his head, hanging loosely against his scalp.  His face still resembled a human, but the jaw was odd, stretched out a little, his nose pulled along with it.  A short fluffy tail wagged behind his back.<br />
<br />
I look like some kind of anthropomorphic freak, thought Rick.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t matter.  It would balance out when he finished his transformation.  But the weirdest thing was his height.  His clothes hung loosely around his body, his pants only remaining thanks to a tight belt.  He had trouble seeing over the bathroom counter into the mirror.<br />
<br />
Guess I am going to be a small dog, thought Rick.  Or maybe a medium size dog.  If I can ever get back to that bag.<br />
<br />
Rick slunk back into the living room, trying to keep his body covered with his loose clothes.  The room was dark, lit only by the glow of the television.  But he didn&#39;t have much difficulty seeing into the room.  He walked towards the back of the couch, following the loud noise of Dana crunching on the dog food.  He was surprised that she was still eating it.<br />
<br />
Hadn&#39;t she noticed the changes yet?  Or did she just not care?<br />
<br />
As he neared the back of the couch he saw that she had already begun to change.  Two long thin black fur covered ears sat on the top of her head, raised to attention and ending in sharp tips.  He could see that she still had hair, but it was slowly receding into her skull, her once shoulder length hair now a short bob.  The ears twitched a little, causing Rick to pause.  But after Dana didn&#39;t turn around he slowly continued to edge towards her.  <br />
<br />
As he neared the couch he felt even smaller.  He was barely eye level with the cushions peaking over the back of the couch.  He felt nervous as he approached but he wasn&#39;t sure why.  Dana lifted a furry hand to her mouth, the dog food loudly crunching in her sharp teeth.  For some reason Dana still had opposable digits, although they were covered in black and brown fur, and her nails had been replaced by sharp claws.<br />
<br />
Rick moved in front of the couch, standing to the side of it so he didn&#39;t block Dana&#39;s view of the television.  He finally had a clear unobstructed view of Dana&#39;s whole body and he was shocked by what he saw.  <br />
<br />
Instead of shrinking, Dana appeared to have grown larger.  It was little hard to tell how big, since everything now seemed larger thanks to his new perspective.  But the hem of her pants were pulled up to her large calves and her shirt was now stretched to reveal a thick, toned flat abdomen.  Her abdomen, like the rest of her body, was covered in short black almost shiny fur.  Her face had changed more than Rick&#39;s, her mouth stretched into a long muzzle.  As she chewed Rick could see long dangerously sharp teeth pulverizing the dog food as she ate.  <br />
<br />
At first glance Rick thought she had changed into that Egyptian dog God, Anubis or something. Then as he continued to stare he realized that she was actually just an anthropomorphic Doberman.  Well, Doberwoman really.<br />
<br />
Great, thought Rick.  I change into a lap dog and she gets to be a Doberman.  Maybe I should just let her have the damn food.<br />
<br />
But the thought of his sister as a vicious attack dog quickly changed Rick&#39;s mind.  He had to get that bag back from her before she finished the whole thing and completed her transformation.  Surely she would return to normal after a while, if she stopped eating before it was too late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sis?  I&#39;m feeling better.  Can I have my snack back?&quot; asked Rick nervously.<br />
<br />
Dana ignored him, continuing to stare ahead at the TV screen.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; she said simply, continuing to munch on the food.  &quot;It&#39;s mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana&#39;s lip quivered and rose up, revealing her long sharp canines.  Was she growling at him?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dana, I bought that, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana suddenly jumped up off the couch, raising on the balls on her large thick paws.  She towered over him, snarling, like a monster from a horror movie.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I said it&#39;s mine!  Go away!&quot; <br />
<br />
It took all Rick&#39;s willpower to keep from wetting himself.  He thought she was going to attack, but standing had knocked the bag to the floor, spilling some of the contents.<br />
<br />
She howled in anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what you made me do!&quot; she yelled.<br />
<br />
She dropped to all fours, eating the food off the ground like an animal.  This seemed to accelerate her changes.  Her hands and feet stretched to long, large paws.  Her chest blossomed into a barrel shape, her breasts receding into her body, while her stomach and waist retracted to a concave shape.  She shook off her clothes in anger, revealing a black fur coat and short bob tail.<br />
<br />
Dana continued to munch, oblivious to her changes.   Rick realized that he had lost this battle.  If he didn&#39;t want to end up as the next item on the menu for her meal, he had to get out of here.  He just hoped that his changes would revert.  If he continued to change into a small dog .... well, he didn&#39;t want to imagine what Dana would do to him.</p>
