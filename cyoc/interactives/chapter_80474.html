<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First things first. She had to find the employee that Kyle had trapped with her. She would likely be very confused, and in a way, Jenny felt responsible for her, whoever it was. More importantly, Jenny was starved for contact with someone else. Someone else that would know she wasn’t just a mannequin. <br />
<br />
What had been her name? Stephanie. That was it. <br />
<br />
Jenny glanced around the store. She was still in the lingerie department, still not having gotten used to moving around just yet. It was empty, dark, and devoid of any movement that she could see. For the moment, at least. She glanced down the row of clothes, and for a moment, considered putting on something over her lingerie. In the end, she decided against it. What was the point? She was still a mannequin. What was the point of covering up? Who would see? And if they did, who would care? <br />
<br />
She opened her mouth experimentally. <br />
<br />
It took conscious effort, but she was able to do it. She tried to speak, but it took her a few tries.<br />
<br />
“Hel…hellllo.” She opened and closed her mouth, getting used to it. <br />
<br />
She took a few steps. Her feet were arched, which made walking steadily difficult. She sighed.<br />
<br />
It was weird walking through the store like this, without anyone around. If she was a normal girl, it might have been fun, but moving around like this felt wrong. She just wanted to go home. Curl up under the sheets. Then wake up, find Kyle, and kick his scrawny little ass. <br />
<br />
Hell. Forget that. The first chance she had, she was going to kill that slimy bastard for doing this to her. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God!”<br />
<br />
Jenny froze at the sound of the voice. <br />
<br />
She turned around and saw her.<br />
<br />
It was the employee that had been changing her for the past two months. She was a cute girl, rather young looking. She had brown hair, cut in a cute fashion, dangling just past her ears and down to her jaw. Her eyes were blue – an artificial blue now, but still a rather striking and beautiful shade. She was wearing a dark blue bikini, and she stood unsteadily, slightly shorter than Jenny. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit, he was actually telling the truth…!” the girl said, her fake eyes open wide. Her mouth opened and closed wordlessly, her lips closing together with a slight plastic click. At the noise, she frowned, and then rubbed at her lips…followed by a moan. The girl buckled on her feet, and almost fell over onto a rack of clothes. “Oh…god…” she muttered, twitching slightly. Jenny felt a wave of sympathy, knowing how intense the pleasure could feel. <br />
<br />
When she recovered, Jenny and the girl stared at each other. Two mannequins. <br />
<br />
“You’re…you’re real…” the girl whispered.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. “Yeah,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God. I can’t believe it. He…he was…he did this to you…and he did it to me! How…long?”<br />
<br />
Jenny looked sad. “Two months…I’ve been here two months.” She smiled sadly. “You dressed me on the first day, in fact.” <br />
<br />
The girl’s eyes went wide. “Oh my God…I remember…they said you were in the wrong section…” She shook her head. “That’s where you transformed, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” <br />
<br />
“What happened?”<br />
<br />
So Jennifer recounted her story. The girl watched, fascinated and horrified at the same time, and when Jenny was done, they were both silent for a time.<br />
<br />
“You’re Stephanie, right?” Jenny asked. <br />
<br />
The girl – Stephanie – nodded. “How…how did you know?” <br />
<br />
“I overheard someone mention you. And well…I’ve gotten to know you a little bit over the past two months. Even if you didn’t realize it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh God.” Stephanie’s eyes went wide. “Oh God! I can’t believe – you were conscious – I changed – you – I didn’t mean – it –“<br />
<br />
Jenny held up a hand, trying to silence the girl. Could a mannequin hyperventilate? She didn’t really want to find out. <br />
<br />
“It’s alright,” she soothed. “Um, to be honest, it felt really fucking good.” <br />
<br />
Stephanie looked even more embarrassed. <br />
<br />
“So, anyway…” Jenny said, feeling awkward. She felt embarrassed now too. A part of her wanted Stephanie to rub her down like she had as an employee. And a part of her wanted to rub Stephanie down…the idea of the pleasure it would bring them…she shook her head, trying to focus. “What…what happened? How did Kyle do it?”<br />
<br />
Stephanie opened her mouth, and then frowned, looking perplexed. “I…I don’t know. There’s…this gap in my memory! Why can’t I remember?”<br />
<br />
“Kyle did it somehow. I can’t remember everything either. There was something that happened before school. Something I think Kyle did. But I just…can’t…remember.”<br />
<br />
“I-I remember showing up for work after school. And then the next thing I knew, I decided that I just had to try on a bikini. I took this one off the rack and went into the changing stall…and…I put it on…and then I struck a pose, admiring myself…and…I just…I…”<br />
<br />
“You froze,” Jenny muttered.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I couldn’t move. I was freaking out…I didn’t know what was going on. I was alone for awhile, and then an employee came in…wondered what I was doing there. I thought he was there to help me, but he just moved me out onto the floor where the swimsuits were and left me there…I tried calling out to him, to anyone, but no one could hear me…”<br />
<br />
Jenny closed her eyes. “I know that feeling,” she whispered. <br />
<br />
“People just walked by. I tried screaming and screaming…oh man.” She took a deep breath. “And that guy…you said his name was Kyle? He showed up. Spoke to me. At first I was overjoyed. Someone knew I was real! But then he spoke in a way that made me realize he’d done this to me somehow. I didn’t understand…he said that the mannequin I changed was real like me, and that we’d both be able to move the next night…”<br />
<br />
“And now…here we are,” Jenny finished sadly.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be real…it’s a dream…”<br />
<br />
“I wish it was,” Jenny said sadly. “I’ve been wishing it for two months.”<br />
<br />
“How…how are we going to get out of this?” Stephanie wondered.</p>
