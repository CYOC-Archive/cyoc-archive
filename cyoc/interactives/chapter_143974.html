<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Animalia Ambassadoria was trying hard to move toward more of a news updating service for Animalia, and showing that Animalia, Horizon, and the Animalian Colonies were all trying to address the most often critiques of the community, and particularly the ones that reflected genuine issues that Animalia had to address, that didn&#39;t mean that some of the special events that they did cover. Valentines Day was one of them, and with Valentines Day falling in the middle of the Lunar New Year celebrations, it meant that the members had to come in after school as part of a specialized script. The thankful thing was that there had some preparation on what was to be done. Even with it though, as the entire crew gathered in the press release room at the Great Hall, there was still a great deal of amazement at the red and pink colored paper that had been put up behind the long table that had been set out for them. Taped to the red and pink paper were the words &quot;Happy Valentines Day&quot; in white paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;They really went all out on this,&quot; Katherine Keuchel commented as she looked at the decoration behind the desk and then noting the red table cloth that hung over the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because its Valentines Day,&quot; Malice answered with her tail wagging and for the moment snuggled up next to Simon, &quot;for those of us with bond-mates... it&#39;s one of the best holidays of the year. Totally devoted to love and being in love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But then the seating arrangement has those of us without &quot;bond-mates&quot; in between you,&quot; Katherine pointed out, pointing to the name cards on the table that went across the front and had it arranged that the Animalian and Human members of Animalia Ambassadoria alternated. From the left side of the table to the right, the cards read: JC, Katherine Keuchel, Pauline, Fred Stairs, Roger, Courtney Hedge, Jessica, Julie Jenkins, Abby, Ronald Wilson, Samson, Lara Walkerson, Sarah, Jenny Jenkins, Travis, Penelope Tellz, Simon, Athena Shepard, Malice, Rebecca Longshot, Sophie, Ryan Patricks, Roland, and finally Johan Eecks.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that though is to try and keep in line with what Animalia Ambassadoria is trying to do... show that Animalians and Humans can work together and that the bigger issues are being addressed and looked at,&quot; Sophie commented, &quot;not to mention to show that the show is not to provide any sort of dating service. The special is on Valentines Day... but we&#39;re still trying to address bigger issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods as they ultimately made their away around to sit on the bench that was there for them to sit on and in the order in which the seating arrangement was made. The bench was tall enough and strong enough that Abby and Samson wouldn&#39;t be cramped and could sit comfortably without being too high that the others couldn&#39;t take their seats as well. Once they were all seated, Abby raised her hand with a thumb raised to the one of the PR department officials to operate the camera that was set up on a tripod near the far wall. It was far enough away that all of the Animalia Ambassadoria members could be seen in the shot and would allow for the special Valentines message to be delivered. The public relations official then raised his own hand with the thumb pointing up to signal that they were ready and starting. With that Abby began the intro to start off the special episode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, everyone and welcome to an Animalia Ambassadoria Valentines Special where we are here at Animalia&#39;s Great Hall to wish everyone a Happy Valentines Day,&quot; Abby spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope that all who have Valentines enjoy the day with those they love,&quot; Samson nodded with a small smile to close the introduction, &quot;and that everyone remembers on the importance of love in everyone&#39;s society and what would be considered truly respectful and what is in line with love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For love is not just about those who are interested in each other having sex,&quot; Courtney spoke, &quot;and trying to push for that, regardless of WHO you are isn&#39;t love. Sex may be a part of a loving relationship, but love is more than sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Love reflects sacrifices and compromises between those involved,&quot; Roger commented, &quot;one gives up something they want to comfort and care for their partner. It can be as little as simply talking with them when they&#39;re frustrated and giving them an empathetic ear...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or it could be as big as taking time off from other things to help someone,&quot; Jessica picked up, &quot;Like caring for someone when they&#39;re sick or injured. Or need some other help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This will also reflect on choosing your love or Valentine,&quot; Ronald commented, &quot;everyone will have people they&#39;re attracted to. And that is okay, but that declaration of interest must be respectful and honest. If they say &quot;no,&quot; forcing them is not acceptable. That ISN&#39;T love. That is obsession.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And many have been known for making those sorts of decisions,&quot; Julie added, &quot;the whole... &quot;if I can&#39;t have you, no one will&quot; trope. That isn&#39;t love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when love is found, there is then question on display...&quot; Travis said slowly, &quot;As it does generate joy... It&#39;s something to be shared and declared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, love between two people will have its own affect on those that notice it,&quot; Sarah agreed, &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be flaunted or used to put others who&#39;ve been less fortunate down. The two doing so may love each other... but &quot;flaunting it&quot; only brings pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why respectfulness is always key, for those looking for love and those that have love,&quot; Fred finished that portion.<br />
<br />
&quot;And not all love will be the same,&quot; Malice spoke, &quot;there is romantic love that bond-mates have... there is parental love that a mother and father will have for their child... there is sibling love between brothers and sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And some times those differences manifest in other ways, and that isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing either,&quot; Penelope commented, &quot;We&#39;ve seen some of the comments with regard to our videos made by those who don&#39;t understand Animalia and have sought to try and score political points...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This has related to those looking at Animalia&#39;s Edicts and noting that Animalian couples tend to be of the same species, particularly with uplifted Animals,&quot; Simon continued, &quot;but it must be remembered that much of this has also related to breeding and providing healthy offspring, which is something to consider when one remembers that Animalians are not just ONE species...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are many species that make up Animalia,&quot; Katherine spoke, &quot;Dogs, cats, cattle, deer, rabbits, mice, and so on. And there Animalia&#39;s edicts are used to reflect with that in relation to breeding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some have made arguments that would refer to comparisons between a Caucasian man and an African American woman together,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;but... again, that coupling is within the same SPECIES. Both are still Human. The Animalian comparison to that would be like Travis, a Dalmatian Dog Animalian and Sarah a Siberian Husky Dog Animalian... or even with Malice as a Husky and Simon as a wolf, given scientific studies that would indicate that the Domestic Dog is really a subspecies of Gray Wolf, thus the same species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And even with some of those complaints,&quot; Lara added, &quot;they&#39;re often made without even bothering to look into Animalian couples. There are a fair number of Animalians, most of which were converted Animalians, that are bond mates with an Animalian that does not match their species. Now, for them it will mean that if they are to have children, the female will either need to accept a &quot;donation&quot; from a male Animalian that matches her species or they will have to adopt a child to raise, which is ultimately no different from many Human couples out there as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Attached to this video will be some &quot;couples profiles&quot; that will show how these mixed species couples met, made their choices, and have accepted the consequences of their being bond mates,&quot; Jenny continued, &quot;Links will be in the description below the screen. Feel free to learn about them and how they love each other before jumping to conclusions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this can tie into other areas where love is different,&quot; Athena nodded to Jenny, &quot;as some times people fall in love with people of the same gender as themselves. Admittedly this is a controversial subject for many people...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And some have sought to use elements of Animalia to serve political causes that reflect that controversy,&quot; JC added, &quot;they judge those who they don&#39;t like and then note that due to many Animalian instincts that will often relate to breeding...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... and then decide, ah-ha, we have a cure!&quot; Johan cut in, &quot;Let&#39;s use Animalia to further it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t love in the sense of respecting your fellow man,&quot; Rebecca commented, &quot;that&#39;s using Animalia as a means to further one&#39;s own prejudices.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And all that does is help cause people harm when they&#39;re being given urges to join Animalia because it will &quot;cure&quot; them of who they love,&quot; Pauline commented, &quot;Who we love is not a disease to be cured.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And our message boards shouldn&#39;t be used to further that sort of thinking,&quot; Ryan commented, &quot;we aren&#39;t here to judge those for who they love. And one may argue that isn&#39;t even our responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So please remember,&quot; Sophie finished the broadcast message, &quot;Love is not something to be controlled or used to judge others. It&#39;s something that demands mutual respect and tolerance. Let us keep that in mind as everyone hopefully enjoys a very happy Valentine&#39;s Day.&quot;</p>
