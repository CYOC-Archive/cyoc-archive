<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After their last round of rutting; Eric and Spencer walk up from the basement and into the kitchen. While its only quarter after six; the two lovers were hungry. Raiding the fridge; Eric cobbles together a couple of sandwiches combining the chicken, turkey, ham and pastrami lunch meats with slice of cheese and not much else. Both Eric and Spencer still in their fursona’s quickly eat their meat sandwiches and try looking for something else to eat.<br />
<br />
Hearing noise in the kitchen Martha comes down from the master bedroom to see her son and his girlfriend cleaning out the fridge of all the lunch meat and now going after the leftovers from past dinners.<br />
Unable to stay silent; Martha laughs getting the attention of the two hungry teenagers, “hungry are we?”<br />
“Ravenous,” was all Eric said as he looked at the last of the leftover pot roast from last Tuesday.<br />
“At least heat up the food before you eat,” Martha approaching the two. Taking some of the leftovers; Martha tosses it all in a frying pan and tries to make some sort of hash. “You can try doing your home work if you have any while you wait.”<br />
Eric and Spencer just shrug their shoulders and quietly collect their school bags and head to the kitchen table. Sitting across from each other; both Eric and Spencer play footsies by caressing each other’s thighs and tickling each other’s sex. Grinning as they try to do homework while distracted; Nate comes in to get a soda from the fridge. Seeing his younger brother in his fursona as well as Spencer in her hybrid fursona. Getting a whiff of the heady aroma of sex; Nate knew what the two just did while he was watching some t.v.<br />
“Leftovers mom,” Nate staring at the frying pan that Martha was tending.<br />
“Your brother and his girlfriend were about to eat them cold,” Martha flipping the concoction while absently humming a happy tune.<br />
“Well I’ll just stick to a sandwich then,” Nate looking in the fridge for some pastrami; “where is my pastrami? Where is the rest of the lunch meat?”<br />
“We ate that already,” Eric giggling as he feels Spenser’s big toe brush up on his sheath.<br />
“All of it?” Nate looking at the two giggling weres at the table; “how can you still be hungry?”<br />
Eric just shrugs his shoulders, unable to answer as he slyly uses his foot to tickle spencer’s inner thigh.<br />
“Well at least you spared the hot dogs,” Nate grumbles.<br />
“Dam,” Spencer looking sad; “we missed eating those.”<br />
<br />
Martha shaking her head as she puts the leftovers fried up as a hash on two plates and placing them next to Eric and spencer’s school work.<br />
“Walk you home after we are done here,” Eric comments as he shovels his food down.<br />
“Sure,” Spencer seeing that it is dark outside; “I could go for a walk while furry.”<br />
Martha overhears thanks to her being a were-vixen and discreetly texts William that he will be able to come home as Eric and Spencer will soon be heading out for a walk. Leaving the two to eat in peace; Martha heads back upstairs as she see Nate eating his hot dog supper while channel surfing.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
William who was at the college using the time he had to play  keep away thanks to Martha; was catching up on some more papers that needed grading. Despite not having a meeting like Martha lied to Eric and Spencer  as she tried to test the young woman with an offer for sex; William was nearly done and looking for more work to do when his wife texted him. Seeing that the message said that Eric and Spencer where about to head out for a walk, made him grin.<br />
<br />
“Finally I can head home,” he smiles as he packs up his briefcase and gets up from his desk. Leaving the small cubicle like office set aside for him in the administration building; William heads out to his car. Loosening his clothes as he walks down the empty halls, all William can think is embracing his wife as they are both furry.<br />
<br />
As he gets into his car; William quickly removes all of his clothes and lets his were-fox fursona out. Feeling the freedom of being furry; he starts up his car and makes a slight adjustment sitting so as not to crush or pinch his tail, William Anderson heads home to be with Martha and enjoy the rest of the evening with her.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
As Eric and Spencer hold paws while walking to the Lawson house; they pass by several other weres, also enjoying the cool evening. With everyone they pass smiling as they can clearly smell the arousal and lust when walking by; Spencer quietly leads Eric into a wooded spot not far from her home. Stroking Eric’s furry chest as she purrs; Eric uses his paws to explore Spenser’s curves. Each smelling their arousal; both close the distance between their bodies. With their chests pressed up against each other; Spencer can feel Eric’s member growing and pressing on her. Kissing Eric, she lithely hops up forcing Eric to catch her as she mashes her sex to Eric’s. Using her paws she manages to grab Eric’s member and guide it in her eager vagina.<br />
<br />
“Let’s give Frieda another moment of our passion,” Spencer coos as she starts bucking her hips; encouraging Eric to brace her up on a large tree as he starts thrusting in unison. <br />
“You know I will never say no for you,” Eric kisses Spencer. Running his rough feline tongue all over her muzzle; Eric uses his paws to cup and grip spencer’s butt checks.<br />
<br />
Spencer moaning as she feels Eric stretching and probing her tunnel; the spines on his feline penis causing her to gasp with each thrust. Reveling in the moment she whips her tail in wild abandon and uses her retractable claws to dig into Eric’s back.<br />
<br />
Both can feel their orgasms building; breathing hard as they rapidly thrust their hips to and fro.<br />
“Do it,” Spencer squeals; “cum in me.”<br />
“Almost their Spencer,” Eric grunts; “Almost. Almost” Eric pants rapidly as he feels his balls clench and Spencer bearing down on him. He yowls in joy as his release flows through him and spills into Spencer. Spencer feeling Eric inside her twitch; shudders and yowls in turn as her own body releases its orgasm, drinking and milking Eric’s seed as she pants, feeling the wondrous pleasure as she is cradled and embraced by Eric.<br />
<br />
Eric feeling the last of his seed passing into Spencer; gently helps her off him. Seeing she is feeling wobbly, he supports her as they continue walking to her house.<br />
“That was enjoyable,” Spencer smiles as she feels all tingly; “I’m sure Frieda will want to play catch up tomorrow.”<br />
“That I have no doubt,” Eric grinning as they both walk; seeing Evan and Maggie Lawson on their front porch.  The two worried parents seeing their daughter with Eric both in their fursona’s, breathe a sigh of relief.<br />
“Where were you,” Maggie the first to speak.<br />
“With Eric here mother,” Spencer smiling, the smell of their recent love making acting as an aphrodisiac; “Nate had detention so we walked back to Eric’s place.”<br />
Evan seeing the big dopey grins for the two and Eric’s semi erect member, just chuckles; “you should have called first.”<br />
“I did,” Spencer answering; “ask mom.”<br />
“Oh,” Maggie realizing that Spencer was right, but was still somewhat sleep deprived with having to pull a night shift at the hospital; “Sorry Evan, I totally forgot to tell you.” All the while she gets a good long look at Eric’s were-panther fursona. Seeing he is a white were-panther all over save for a light shade of brown on his head; Maggie can’t help but think ‘You have one sexy boyfriend their Spencer.’  <br />
“Alright,” Evan sighing; “no harm no foul. Your home and safe, that’s what’s important.”<br />
“Come Eric,” Spencer grinning; “help me pick out my wardrobe for my overnight bag for tomorrow evening’s fun.”<br />
“I’m sure Eric has his own overnight bag to get ready,” Maggie yawning; “you and Eric can have more fun tomorrow.”<br />
Eric grins, “You have no idea.”<br />
Spencer smiles knowing what Eric just meant there; before she heads inside, Spencer gives Eric a deep and passionate kiss. “See you tomorrow Eric.”<br />
“I’ll see you and Frieda in my dreams first,” Eric purring.<br />
<br />
Spencer grins as she is escorted inside by her parents, leaving Eric alone in the front lawn of the Lawson house. With nothing better to do; Eric decides to burn off some energy by having a run into woods while heading back home.</p>
