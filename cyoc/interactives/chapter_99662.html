<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night had gone well for William and Martha Anderson. They had met Alex Ramsey and found him to be a good young man, and so long as he didn&#39;t hurt Nate, they had no problem with their budding romance together. The bigger thing had been Eric&#39;s update on his relationship with Julie Stovall. That he would become a were in the future be with her, and specifically to be a weremer, was a key part of it, but so long as Eric was happy, both William and Martha would support him. They had obvious concerns and had reiterated their preference that Eric wait until he was at least sixteen before he and Julie took their relationship to the next level, as that was the age Nate currently was, and Eric did agree to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... he...&quot; William gave a low chuckle as he began undressing for bed when they made it up to their room after Eric had gone to bed and Nate returned home from the Ramseys and went to bed himself, &quot;Who would have thought when we came here that we&#39;d all eventually become weres...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Martha mused as she began unbuttoning her shirt and walked into the adjoining bathroom to their bedroom. She continued to speak as she knew William could hear her while she ran water to get ready to brush her teeth. &quot;Nate always had interest in all this... in our way... both of us came to see the pluses to were society. I realized who I was and chose this...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha squeezed out some toothpaste onto her toothbrush and placed it under the water to wet the brush bristles a bit, and then brought the toothbrush up to her face and began brushing. As she brushed, she heard William complete her thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;And even with the lack of choice for me... in the end, Yvette&#39;s actions did do much for me specifically,&quot; William answered, &quot;Moon Lake was to be a new start... to get away from my old mistakes and start over, and being a werefox... having my bond to you... it&#39;s made things so much easier for me... for us... and has become very enjoyable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded to the mirror even though William couldn&#39;t see her doing so. He continued speaking as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now Eric has agreed, out of love, to become a were as well,&quot; William continued, &quot;all after being here a short time... I mean... WE were against staying here, let alone being weres. Eric seemed a little scared of things regarding were society. Yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha finished brushing her teeth and set her toothbrush down in a plastic cup that was designed to hold toothbrushes. William had come to the doorway to brush his own teeth. He was fully naked and his large penis hung flaccid between his legs and moonlight coming from the bedroom glinted off of his now well toned muscles. He may not have been heavily muscled, but his muscle tone was excellent for a man of his height and left William looking very sexy, even in his human form. In that he was perfect and Martha was privately certain that even in its flaccid state, that William&#39;s new equipment could give her a great deal of pleasure, and she felt her own body begin to respond to the sight of her husband&#39;s nudity.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet we now love BEING weres and Eric is looking forward to being a were himself now,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;All for love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha slipped around her husband and walked in her bedroom. As she heard William turn the water on to brush his teeth, Martha opened the laundry chute and began dropping the clothing she&#39;d worn for the meeting down it. Some of it didn&#39;t smell too bad, but she figured better to keep track of things and put together an ultimate plan for clothing that would fit the new her better. As their present expenses had limited what she could buy from Awareness earlier in the week, and while she could get plenty from the Target on one of the eastern spokes of the town for some things that would fit her better, but Awareness would likely be the only place that she or William could get clothing that could shift with them, and that would mean careful planning and time for both of them to get their wardrobes updated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will agree, it is fast...&quot; Martha continued, &quot;but I can&#39;t help but feel supportive and happy for Eric. After all he&#39;s been through...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both the bullies and the stuff we put him through,&quot; William agreed in the bathroom, &quot;it is good to see him happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha slid off her skirt and tossed it down the laundry chute. The sight of William&#39;s naked form when he entered the bathroom flashed through her mind again and she felt herself become warm between her legs and then pulled her panties down as well. When she began to wrestle with her bra, one of the ones she&#39;d bought from Awareness, which Martha had found extremely comfortable and supportive on her new figure, she came to the next issue they&#39;d likely have help Eric with regarding his growing relationship with Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might need to talk more with Eric about the &quot;birds and the bees&quot; though,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;even if he and Julie wait until they&#39;re sixteen to have sex... it&#39;d be a good idea to make sure he understands ALL the potential consequences and so forth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s already aware to a degree,&quot; William answered, and Martha heard the water faucet turn off, &quot;he&#39;s a smart kid... and to some extent... we&#39;ve already had &quot;the talk&quot; concerning his changing body and so on as it related to puberty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will that to being a weremer?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might have to talk with Julie&#39;s father to get the details needed for that talk... or see if Eric actually talked with Mr. Stovall today,&quot; William replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but he didn&#39;t seem to know what a birth control pill was,&quot; Martha answered as she dropped her bra down the laundry chute.<br />
<br />
Martha ultimately did her best to explain what a birth control bill was, as a medication that suppressed the uterus&#39; ability to accept a fertilized egg that would lead to pregnancy in a woman. Julie didn&#39;t need the pill to keep herself alive and healthy, but she would need it to keep herself from becoming a mother before she was ready. Both she and William had also impressed on Eric that when he and Julie took their next step that Eric be respectful and that he make sure that Julie had taken her pill for that day. It also included some explanation on how the birth control pills in Moon Lake were specially designed to work with the hormones of each female were-beast. Martha even showed Eric the pill bottle that contained her werecat birth control pills before she took her pill for the night/day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... until we moved here... we were so infrequent with our intimate time together... between my mistakes and you trying to repress being bisexual... that you weren&#39;t taking any birth control pills while we were in Minnesota,&quot; William answered, and came from the bathroom sporting a massive erection between his legs.<br />
<br />
Martha eyed her husband&#39;s massive rod and licked her lips at the sight of it The sight of it and the scent of arousal that her husband gave off also served to further arouse her and raise the level of wetness between her legs. William slowly approached her and placed his hands on her hips and held her to him. His erect member felt warm and hard against her belly as they stood together.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s only now as weres,&quot; William continued as his eyes shifted to the red color of his werefox form with his pupil stretching into a vertical slit in the center of the iris. Martha&#39;s eyes went through a similar change, though her eyes became green as William continued, &quot;now that our marriage is so rapidly healing and as we are becoming more sexually active with each other... as it always should have been... it&#39;s something that you need now to prevent becoming pregnant. It&#39;s something that Eric hasn&#39;t seen before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still,&quot; Martha smiled as she felt brown fur begin to grow all over her body as she gave her husband a brief kiss, relishing the feel of her brown fur and whiskers rubbed against the white fur growing on the lower part William&#39;s upper lip and the reddish-orange fur growing above the white fur, &quot;it will be a good idea to let Eric now about these things before he joins were society... and it&#39;d probably be a good idea not to wait until he&#39;s sixteen... just in case he has a bought of teenage rebellion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha gave a soft mewing moan as William began to softly nibble at her neck, and she could feel his teeth lengthen into the sharp fang-like canines of a fox and his incisors and molars also sharpened, just as her own teeth did the same in her own mouth, though her teeth were a cat&#39;s teeth. She felt William&#39;s black furred hands begin to massage her body, serving to arouse her even further. One rubbed gently at the base of her growing tail, over one her butt-cheeks, around a hip, down the juncture of her leg to her torso, the wet juncture between her legs, around the other leg, up her other hip, across her other butt-cheek until it came back the base of the her brown furred tail. His stubby claws gently combed her growing fur as they moved over he body and William was so gentle that it served to arouse her further. His other hand massaged one of her breasts and at times playfully flicked at her erect nipples. This combined with William&#39;s kisses at her neck and up to her lips as she let out her inner cat and he let out his inner fox sent her over the edge and she came, just from the feeling of her husband&#39;s fur against her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll have no problems,&quot; William said with a smile to his wife, as his face painlessly pushed forward into a vulpine muzzle. Martha felt her own rounded feline muzzle push out shortly after. <br />
<br />
The transformation wasn&#39;t painless, and to a degree, it was even arousing in and of itself, but she did feel substantially more comfortable once her muzzle had fully grown in, as her teeth always seemed to lengthen and change before her muzzle grew. It left her with the feeling of a cat&#39;s teeth inside a largely human mouth, which was a bit uncomfortable until her muzzle had pushed forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Martha smiled as she pulled William to her and gave his butt a gentle squeeze before rubbing at the base of his tail, which raised a deep moan from him.<br />
<br />
With that the two began to move toward their bed, fully transformed and fully aroused. Martha carefully settled backward onto the bed, the tip of her tail twitching at the sight of her husband&#39;s massive werefox member. Most women wouldn&#39;t be able to easily take him in his werefox form. They might be able to get down as far as his knot, but wouldn&#39;t get any further than that. But, as a werecat, Martha knew that she could, both by instinct and experience since their respective transformations. Feeling that massive member stretch her lower lips had brought her a great deal of pleasure and very much pleased the part of her that was sexually attracted to men. It did so much for that side of her, that while Samantha and Frances might have various toys, her time with them was to be strictly werecat on werecat. If she wanted something penis-like, why would she settle for something fake when she could get the real thing at home? Especially when she knew that William&#39;s bond to her assured her that the massive erect member between his furry legs was all HERS.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Martha,&quot; William said to her as he climbed onto the bed and above his wife, &quot;the love of my life... the kindest... most forgiving woman I&#39;ve ever known... were or normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you too,&quot; Martha smiled and actually purred when she felt William ease himself into her, &quot;and I... ooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmmm... yeeessss... I love Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
William gave a low moan as Martha massaged at his own chest while wrapping her legs around his own to pull him deeper into her. While werecats might not have the instinctive knowledge on how to please each other sexually the way he did as a werefox, but Martha had always known how to please him, and their respective transformations didn&#39;t change that.<br />
<br />
&quot;The best... ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah... decision we... ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... ever made,&quot; William moaned through the grip that   Martha&#39;s vagina had on his penis. His knot hadn&#39;t penetrated her, yet, but with the way things felt for him, that wouldn&#39;t be too far. He could feel his penis twitch with each thrust into  Martha, and as they continued, Martha purred in pleasure as he rubbed and nibbled and licked her neck, breasts, and nipples, and that purr seemed to go through her whole body. It was like her whole body vibrated in pleasure. &quot;It healed... ooooooooohhhh... our marriage...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It gave Nate... ooooohhhhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm YES! YES! ... his dreams...&quot; Martha gave a pleasure filled moan back to her husband. William&#39;s knot was beginning to penetrate her, which would mean he was getting close to an orgasm and while William&#39;s erection and werefox skill and providing her with physical pleasure had given her a few orgasms already, she knew that once his knot penetrated her... the orgasm that came with that would be bigger. She thrust her hips forward to counter her husband&#39;s thrusts to feel that wonderful sensation.<br />
<br />
&quot;And... it has... oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssss... helped Eric,&quot; William began, his body beginning to tremble with pleasure as his knot was getting ready to penetrate his wife&#39;s wet opening, &quot;groooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww and... ooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh yyeeeeeeeeeessss... heal...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And... he... will... be... okay,&quot; Martha said slowly trying to keep from calling out as they were getting much closer, but things did feel right. And as William&#39;s knot penetrated her and both of them felt a powerful orgasm rock both of them. Both of them were comfortable in their future together and in their sons&#39; pleasant futures.</p>
