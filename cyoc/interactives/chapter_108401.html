<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Choices we make have fallout in our futures, and some like similar of the past have not wholly come to fruition. Brian is just beginning to understand what Llandros was planning, though at the outset, his offering appeared foolhardy, brash, and untrustworthy, as time passed he became the savior of those thought to being damned. <br/>
<br/>
As about turn, those who expected greatness, found their world turned inside out, as Mason had a big mouth, he would spend three years being a pussy. Mason had a mouth capable of swallowing what came, and from the new experiences, of what he swallowed germinated into new life. <br/>
<br/>
All of what was of face value is rarely what is becomes through time. Promises written on ice and stored in an oven seem to quickly melt away into vain as vague foolish hopes. Promises are likened to piecrusts, they become broken before eaten or destroyed!  </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time and living of life held within the form of an animal, as of Brian he being a horse, beast of burden, as stallion used for a stud, his life slowed to living a daily drudgery. The wondrous adventure had dulled both his fantasy about becoming a stallion horse, he similar to how Llandros the wizard had offered some suggestions about those who became as horses and lived free from human morals and family sociological expectations. Although the occasional mating session sparked in Brian a well remembered feeling of delight, the rest of his lifestyle by becoming a Percheron horse slipped into a dull sort of doldrum. <br />
<br />
So what then after the fun and glory of being transformed into a wholly different embodiment had become a dull sort of existing, there was the down side of being an animal. Downs came from the insect realm, as flies both small to big would lite on Brian and take to licking or biting him about his body. Favorite places for flies to walk was encircling his puckered equine anus. The flies walking felt like a tickling that he had a tail to try to us for making the tortured tickling to cease. Those larger flies, horseflies set down, they could bite at tended flesh, the anus, his scrotum, or the sheath and what when having an erection his horse cock came under attack.<br />
<br />
Mosquitoes too were a itch maker, as well ticks and lice, sand fleas, left their mark as itchy places enough to drive even an ignorant beast to going insane during three seasons of any year. As time passed by, Brian let go of his wishing to recall of different times when he being of the human race had ways to avert the blights common to animals.<br />
<br />
It happened that after two years of not seeing or having the chance to meet with Llandros, that the wizard came for a Sunday afternoon stroll, and stopped to visit the stables.<br />
<br />
Man or beast, they of the farm working class knew who was their master, as Llandros was a wizard and well all knew enough to give him the respect he demanded be his.<br />
<br />
Brian was somewhat in involved with his lips nibbling the flanks of a draft horse mare to evade taking note of the Master arriving.<br />
<br />
As Brian stood sheath deep and thrusting his erect cock within the confines of his brood mare, Llandros came to stand as watch of someone who was born to being human, doing as he was changed, and given a new purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun there Brian, that mare has her tongue hanging out her mouth, her head held low, she swooning as you are mating with her.&quot; Llandros said, as a few men there began to chuckle, but quickly ceased their humored laughs when the Wizard turned to give them a wary gaze as if they too might know life with a different purpose.<br />
<br />
Brian heard his Master speak, but after such a time that had passed, he the human had drained from the mind, leaving only the beast controlling what was a handsome stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sad for him Master, dare I speculate, his passion and the bestial lusts he has known caused his mind to wane. The lad Brian who thee knew is all but gone to being an animal. It is sad that he lost his mind and accepted living of life as would a common beast. Please do not take offense as to my feelings for him that thee were the cause of his doom. Thee art our master and owner here, we who work here know our place but own feelings for they who we knew were human before becoming different of their purpose in life.&quot; El-Sandrous said, he speaking rather bold like with the Master and wizard.<br />
<br />
&quot;No offense taken, as I respect those in my employ who knowing their place, have enough concern for their fellows, be they humans or different from what they were born.<br />
<br />
I noted though that two young manure shoveling workers were making sport of Brian as he was endeavoring to please both his mare and me as I stood watching the breeding session. I ask then if the stables or farm in general has any need for two young male animals?&quot; Llandros asked of the stables manager and horse groomsman. <br />
<br />
Llandros stood and watched his stables manager begin to cringe at the thought of his being asked such a formidable question, he having seen that one of the boys made mention was his older son Mason.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Master, you are of a mindset to cause my elder son Mason to become as an animal here on the farm?&quot; El-Sandros asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your eldest son aye, and he who was his partner in laughter, what is his name and whom is he a son of?&quot; Llandros asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tinker is his name, he arrived here the son of a farm lessee worker, was badly ignorant of even the basic social graces. His father is a brute of a man, he beat his son and beats his wife, if there be a man worthy of becoming a beast, that man should feel thy wrath.&quot; El-Sandros said, as from where Brian stood still sheath deep, he hearing the conversation knew just of who the Masters were speaking about. Tinker loved to tinker with Brian, he washing the sheath and cock of he the prime stables stallion. Tinker would tinker with the erect cock, stroking of it, and giving it the love only a perverted human would know how to do.<br />
<br />
Brian screamed a whinny as he stepped back, pulling out from the mare his stiff, as quite erect still the cock. Falling to stand upon all fours, Brian pranced happily away from the horny mare, and went then to stand as a handsome stallion in the presence lf his owner, Master, and the wizard he knew made him as he was, a horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings there Brian, I give you the ability now to speaking you mind, do tell me if you are enjoying being my prize stallion?&quot; Llandros asked of Brian the stud horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah, ah, oh, me, ah, thank you Master Llandros for allowing me to say what I think. As true as it gets, I am tried of being an animal, a horse, a Percheron draft horse, although being a stallion used for stud breeding of horny mares remains a constant bit of good delighting fun.   I dislike being tortured by bugs, and the personal disdain of Mister Mason. If I being what you made of me held within you any slight consideration, if I were to request of you that he, Mason be more doomed than am I, he I would ask for him to become as merged into my maleness, he of body being my cock, his mouth puking urine and semen, his brain as one of my big balls. I hate him to wish to damn him that he know the indignity of what I feel from him about how you used me to become a horse, animal, and living with my burdens.&quot; Brian said, as Llandros looked at then the two cringing young men.<br />
<br />
&quot;TINKER, you come to me, now!&quot; Llandros said.<br />
<br />
He who was named as Tinker walked to meet the wizard, was scared of the Master, knowing what he had the power to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm thy horrors as Brian spoke well of thee, and for this I deem that as of today your only work shall be to keep clean the penis of every sire male I own, residing here at this farm. <br />
<br />
El-Sandros, bring to me your son Mason!&#39; Llandros commanded of his stables manager.<br />
<br />
El-Sandros took hold of the arm of his eldest son, and he with Mason then approached Llandros.<br />
<br />
&quot;He meant no disrespect of thee Master,&quot; El-Sandros said, his voice having a quivering tone, showing the worry he held for his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;MASON,&quot; Llandros said with a loud as demanding a tone for the young man to stand and be obedient.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir Mister Wizard..., so you want me to suck and kiss the penises of your farm studs!&quot; Mason said with a sense of foolish boldness that made his father to cringe, and Brian listening, he reached out his muzzle as tried to bite Mason.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have your share of guts talking to someone like me in such a bold fashion, so would you like it if I purposed you to be bold as your employed work for me?&quot; Llandros said, asking the young fool to damn his own future.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir, and no thanks to you or your witch wife Hillary, as she like her previous husband had a delight for cock sucking, she has had me spend a night wooing or mouthing, I maw her old as wrinkled cunt. She does much behind your back, as the closer she gets, the more one can expect she shall put a knife in any a man, any a man not feeling an undying appreciation of her style of lovemaking.<br />
<br />
I know you have the power to make me become as some dirty beast, well so be it, it would have happened either by you or your wife burdening me!&quot; Mason said, his boldness and words told were true of Hillary, as Llandros knew enough about her as not turn his back lest she do him harm.<br />
<br />
&quot;You almost charmed me to leave you as unpunished for daring to laugh at my handsome stallion mating his mare.<br />
<br />
Brian suggested you be as merged physically into what is the cock and balls of this fine Percheron stallion. However, I think you being so bold should win you a time of being alluring and bold. El-Sandros, what I do is not permanent, but from it should teach Mason some sense of humility. He is not in my opinion as horse cock worthy, but from his mouth comes his damning, so then his mouth and tongue shall be his primary true appendages.<br />
<br />
I wave upon Mason my wish and wand, as from this moment in time until three years from this day shall he be as merged with that draft mare, his mouth becoming for her and him as that winking black lips of horse sex. Mason shall taste the cocks entering, the semen spewed, the vaginal excretions weeping, as without eyes or ears he shall know what I make of him, Mason go, go now, be thee merged with that horny mare.<br />
<br />
Brian friend I bequest to thee that ye be diligent for one more week and impregnate that mare. When you have finished with her, I Llandros has a knew as different purpose for thee, come next week and we shall meet!&quot; Llandros said, as Brian felt happy, returned to again molest and mate the draft mare, he relishing to give Mason a mouth filled full of stallion spunk.</p>
