<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Jillian, having Rose over was perhaps the greatest experiences of her life. <br />
<br />
Before transforming Rose into a teenager, Jillian had resigned herself to simply coming home and quietly thinking about how to solve her problems. That now changed with Rose Nolan around.<br />
<br />
Rose was gregarious, a bundle of energy with an exuberant personality that helped Jillian relax. The two girls were quite different. Jillian was more reserved, a warm person but someone who kept most of her thoughts bottled up. If the teen were being honest, she could count her close friends on one hand. Usually this didn&#39;t bother her, Jillian had little love for the cliques of high school. She preferred being her own person and focusing on her studies. Jeff, though, was something entirely unfamiliar to her.<br />
<br />
Rose, by contrast, was an expressive, energetic girl. Like Jillian she cared little of high school hierarchy. The difference between the two was that while Jillian was content with being a wallflower, Rose had little issue with expressing whatever thought crossed her mind. This of course branded her as an oddball. Rose loved the outdoors, more interested in gardening, hiking, or nature than whatever trend had filtered its way through school. She, like Rose, had few friends but the ones she did she was loyal to the end.<br />
<br />
This is what Jillian was now so thankful for. Instead of sitting in her room, worrying about Jeff, she had a girlfriend to talk with. Rose listened, she offered advise, helped Jillian focus on what the important things were as far as a relationship went. Yes, Jeff was cute but as Rose put it looks fade.<br />
<br />
Jillian had laughed at that one. They were 16, wrinkles and grey hairs were decades away. Well, they were usually that far away unless she used the Chronovac. Deciding on holding onto that secret, at least for a little while, Jillian was able to get an honest read from another girl on Jeff Davis.<br />
<br />
Jeff was cute but as Rose put it it wasn&#39;t his face that made him attractive. Jeff was immensely kind and incredibly responsible. Ross thought it was so cute how he looked over a herd of kids everyday. Jeffs instincts seemed to be that he wanted to do what was right. He looked out for his adoptive brothers, cared for a group of impressionable kids, and helped them grow into caring people. &quot;How many guys you know would be willing to sacrifice their afternoons to watch a bunch of munchkins,&quot; Rose exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Jillian shrugged, not many to her knowledge. Rose simply smiled, hugging her friend and essentially giving her blessing to ask Jeff out. &quot;Why do I have to ask him out,&quot; Jillian stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because between the two of you you&#39;ll just stammer like idiots at one another and never make a move,&quot; Rose countered. &quot;Jill, I love ya and Jeff is cool but you two are the shyest people I know. If no one makes a move you two will never hook up. Besides, who says a girl can&#39;t ask a guy out? Its 2022, break that wheel girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jillian nodded, hugging her new best friend. She couldn&#39;t be happier to have Rose in her life now. Unfortunately though it wouldn&#39;t last. Rose had to head hone after their talk, she needed to get somethings done around the house before her grandfather came home. Saying their goodbyes, Rose bounded for home saying she would text later. Now Jillian once again found herself alone.<br />
<br />
Being an only child could suck sometimes. Jillian parents worked late, meaning she far too often found herself alone in the house. Growing up she had always wanted a sibling, like a bolt of lightning it now hit her. She could just make one. The only question was who?<br />
<br />
Their were plenty of single people around her neighborhood. The house she lived in seemed to be a destination point for widows and divorces. For Jillian this gave her numerous options. She could find a sister, picking out an elderly widow or divorced single woman. That was easy enough the only question then was how old.<br />
<br />
Should she create an older sister, someone she could get advice from. The idea was appealing, someone just a little more experienced with life that could help Jillian out. <br />
<br />
Another option though was a younger sister. How young though, Jillian wasn&#39;t sure. Should she create a preteen who was close in age. It could work, someone she could have more adult conversations with like she did with Rose. It would be helpful especially if Rose wasn&#39;t around for some reason. She could also try for a much younger sibling, say kindergarten or first grade. It would give Jillian a reason to see Jeff more often. Maybe being around Jeff would make he more comfortable in asking him out.<br />
<br />
The final option for Jillian was creating a little brother. Jillian immediately crossed the idea of an older brother off the list. Over the years she had seen enough girls with over protective brothers. For whatever reason older brothers seemed to treat little sisters as if they were made of porcelain. The last thing Jillian wanted was her new older brother scaring Jeff off.<br />
<br />
This once again led to Jillian considering a much younger sibling. Perhaps a brother in kindergarten or first grade would become friends with Jeffs younger siblings. It was possible and it would give her any even better chance of spending time with Jeff. Taking a breath, Jillian now looked out into her neighborhood trying to find her new sibling.</p>
