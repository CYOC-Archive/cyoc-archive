<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait I have a plan! Are you in!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? Ellie, there&#39;s no time for that! You need to hide before my sister sees you!&quot; Jamal argued as he pushed Ellie from the back and pushed her towards the big window, where they entered the room from.<br />
<br />
Ellie shrugs off Jamal&#39;s hands and confronted him.&quot;Okay, fine. You won&#39;t listen to what I say,&quot; Ellie paused as she sat on the bed crossing her legs, &quot;then let&#39;s wait for your sister to come in.&quot; She nonchalantly said as she checked her finger nails ignoring the tense atmosphere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamal, Who are you talking to!? Is someone in your room!?&quot; Deena, rattled the doorknob. She heard Jamal talking to someone, whose voice she didn&#39;t recognize. &quot;Open the door, dweeb!! I know your awake!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal was shitting his pants right now. His sister heard their conversation, but Ellie&#39;s stubbornness is wasting him a lot of precious time. He can&#39;t let his sister find out Ellie or even the gloves.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the door. Deena&#39;s having a hard time. She used all the keys yet it&#39;s still locked. She banged the knocked again to get Jamal attention. Knowing that Jamal was hiding something from her and their mother. She was excited on how she&#39;s gonna spin the story to make her brother look bad again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ellie, please. if Deena finds out and tells mom about this, my computers gonna be thrown  in the trash!&quot; Jamal pleaded, &quot;I spent five year&#39;s worth of allowance on it. five years of my life will be thrown in garbage if mom finds out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft! I know that, we just literally just merged into one remember.&quot; Ellie just literally scoffed at Jamal&#39;s pathetic excuse.<br />
<br />
*Bang**bang**bang* &quot;Jamal!! Open the door!! You have thirty seconds. Open the door or I&#39;ll tell mom about this!!&quot; Deena declared her ultimatum and immediately started her countdown.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what&#39;s it gonna be!?&quot; Ellie asked smiling slyly. &quot;Take it, or leave it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal scratched his head as he gave in to Ellie&#39;s demands. Her plan was his only choice left. he sighed in agreement to whatever Ellie was trying to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! What&#39;s the plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellie could see Jamal getting grumpy, and returned a shrewd smile. &quot;first, let your sister in and distract her while I&#39;m hiding behind the door---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah, whoah, whoah!! Why are involving my sister here!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamal, are you in or not!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-of course I&#39;m in!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then do as I say! it&#39;s almost time. Open the door and distract her!&quot; Ellie commanded as she hid behind the door while Jamal unlocked. Deena came barging in immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;AhaH!!... Wheres the person you were talking to!?<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know what your talking about? hehe...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop lying Dweeb!! Where are you hiding her--- MMMMmmmmmhhh!!, MMMmmmhHHH!!&quot; Deen was surprised when Ellie grabbed her from the back covering her mouth. Jamal flinch from the sudden assault on her sister whose struggling to breakfree from Ellie&#39;s grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use the gloves on!&quot; Ellie ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I only have one of the pair.&quot; Jamal meekly argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;MHmMMmhmmm!! MHmmMMHHMmm!!&quot; Deena&#39;s words turned to mumbles as her mouth was covered by Ellie&#39;s gloved hand. Ellie&#39;s having difficulties in holding Deena down as she tries to twist and shake her grip away.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s gonna get away, Jamal! Just Use It!!&quot; Jamal slammed his left hand wearing one of the gloves on Ellie&#39;s arms. his hand slightly pushed in as the schwoop sound was heard again. Jamal stepped back as Ellie fused with Deena. He didn&#39;t know it would work with only one on his hands.<br />
<br />
Their stood by the door step was a girl maybe in her early 20s, by averaging Ellie and Deena&#39;s age. standing between Deena&#39;s 5&#39; 2&quot; and Ellie&#39;s 5&#39; 9&quot;, she was about 5&#39; 5&quot; tall. The fusion girl has an coca-cola-esque body. Deena&#39;s off-shoulder crop top merged with Ellie&#39;s sports bra made a off-shoulder tube sports bra supporting their combined DD-cup breast, Ellie&#39;s yoga pants combined with Deena&#39;s leggings turned into leggings firm level yet still breathable yoga pants complete with pockets and belt loops covered Deena&#39;s fat butt and hips combined with Ellie&#39;s toned shaped making it look firmer than sagging. She also wearing a running shoes with sandal straps.<br />
The newly fused girl opened her dark blue eyes, a combination of Ellie&#39;s blue and her sister&#39;s black eyes. She flicked her hair against her beige toned shoulders as she placed right hand on her hips. She revealed a smug reminiscent of Deena&#39;s usual smirk face.<br />
&quot;So, How do I look?&quot; the fusion girl asked.Jamal noticed her that she spoke in his sister&#39;s accent mixed with Ellie&#39;s gentler tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;uh... Uhm... b-beautiful?...&quot; Jamal himself was awe strucked by the union of Ellie and his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful? That&#39;s a bit creepy coming from you, dweeb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal was hurt by those words. since, technically she is still his obnoxious sister. at the thought of his sister, Jamal realise the danger he was in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ellie fused with Deena that means,&quot; Jamal paused as he looked at this girls eyes. &quot;If you unfuse then Deena will know about the gloves too! What have I done!!&quot; Jamal face-palmed himself because he made another mistake. His problem were getting worse and worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are talking about, bro? Didn&#39;t you know what was the purpose of me wearing the gloves? I mean technically it was Ellie, not me.&quot; The fusion girl corrected herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you mean by that!?&quot; Jamal asked, confused by what the girl&#39;s referring to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! Jamal, I thought you were smarter than this!?&quot; fusion girl retorted, &quot;I can&#39;t believe that your dumb and a dweeb, at the same time.&quot; the girl sighed. That soft spoken insult carved deep into Jamal&#39;s heart scarring him for life.<br />
<br />
Jamal thought long and hard by what she meant by having one of the gloves, until he got the idea. The previous fusion were fused by the gloves can&#39;t remember anything when they defused, but Jellie was resulted from a fusion with the gloves remember everything when they defuse. With that rule in mind, Jamal thought that Ellie was aiming for...<br />
<br />
&quot;A fusion with only one of the people can remember everything after they defuse...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ding!! ding!! ding!! You finally got it dweeb!&quot; the fusion girl jumped on Jamal and gave him a noogie, as she teased her half brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you atleast stop with the dweeb!&quot; Jamal protested as he tried to break free from the headlock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calling you a dweeb is already a habit. That means no dweeb.&quot; Jamal frowned at her response. &quot;Ready for Stage two of the plan, bro?&quot;</p>
