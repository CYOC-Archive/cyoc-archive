<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Our episode title is also a song by Crosby, Stills, and Nash; without Neil Young on the original recording. Also, there is a LOT of sex in this installment. Enjoy!—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Martha Anderson was thoroughly enjoying herself!<br />
Being bi, she was eating a creamy pussy as her own cunt was being wonderfully fucked by a good cock.<br />
The fact that the woman she was eating was also getting fucked at the same time just added to the fun.<br />
When she and her husband William left the hospital yesterday after visiting Maggie Lawson and seeing her newborn son, the happily married couple were at a loss as to what to do with their evening.<br />
They had been looking forward to going to The Were Club all week, for with the two of them quite strong within their vulpine life/soul mate bond as werefoxes, they had no problem enjoying the physical benefits of an open marriage either together or separately.<br />
However, with the town currently under a Code: W alert because of the situation with Freddie &quot;The Shark&quot; Parker and his fellow mobsters around, the town had taken necessary precautions, including not allowing anyone in their were form in public and closing down The Club.<br />
&quot;So now what do we do?&quot; Martha asked William as they sat in the hospital parking lot.<br />
The fact that she was stroking his pants covered cock even as she had raised her dress hem and was now fingering her own underwear covered vagina didn&#39;t help her husband&#39;s concentration any, but he finally came up with a plan.<br />
<br />
As much as they might need the relief, contacting their next door neighbors Samantha and Frances Twist was out, so he called Douglas and Dawn Hale, a mated pair of fellow werefoxes who also enjoyed a swinging/open marriage.<br />
&quot;Come on over,&quot; said Dawn eagerly when William called, accenting the first word of that sentence to have a different meaning. &quot;The more the merrier.&quot;<br />
Mr. Anderson tried asking, but Dawn wouldn&#39;t elaborate further, so William drove as fast as he safely could despite his wife playing with his personal &quot;stick shift&quot;.<br />
When they arrived, there were a couple of other cars parked along the street as well as the Hales own vehicles in their driveway.<br />
Dawn met them at the front door wearing only a bathrobe and a smile.<br />
As she closed and locked the front door behind them, Dawn happily greeted each of the new arrivals with a passionate French kiss as she fondled their respective sex organs before dropping the robe to reveal she was totally nude underneath as she resumed her werevixen fursona.<br />
&quot;Strip and get furry!&quot; Dawn told them, even as she started trying to help the Andersons undress. &quot;The fun&#39;s in the basement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon William and Martha were nude and proudly displaying their fursonas as Dawn lovingly put an arm around Martha&#39;s waist, grabbed William by his now very hard vulpine penis, and led them downstairs.<br />
The smells assailed their sensitive were nostrils even before they made it through the door to the basement stairs, but the sight that greeted both of them as they hopped off the bottom step made everyone smile.<br />
Dawn&#39;s mate Douglas was happily plowing his own vulpine cock deep into the vagina of a weredog French Poodle the Andersons had never met before even as she was orally enjoying the penis of a weredog English Pug. The fact that the Poodle was able to take that proud canine cock deep down her throat well past its top knot impressed both Martha AND William, who was looking forward to feeling the lady&#39;s talented mouth on his own sex organ.<br />
&quot;Since we couldn&#39;t go to The Were Club, we called up some friends and sort of had The Were Club come to us,&quot; explained Dawn. &quot;But it certainly wouldn&#39;t be a party without you two,&quot; she added with a smile, before she got down on her knees before the Andersons.<br />
Before the happy couple knew it, Dawn was busily lapping at Martha&#39;s now very wet cunt even as she was massaging William&#39;s cock with one paw.<br />
<br />
The rest of that night was a typical, all out orgy!<br />
Besides getting to sample the French Poodle for herself, Martha also had sex with the English Pug, as well as a werepuma, a weretiger, and a werewolf that was there. Of course, at one point Martha couldn&#39;t wait to be double teamed by both her own husband AND Dawn&#39;s mate, for she had long ago gotten over her hang up of William&#39;s being the only cock she would allow to plow her nether regions.<br />
William naturally enjoyed every hole the ladies had to offer at least twice during the night, but lost track on who he had and hadn&#39;t been with as he tried for thirds. He had never been with a weretigress or a werecougar (the puma&#39;s &quot;date&quot;) before, but definitely looked forward to being with the female of those species again. The she-wolf also provided a howling good time. Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.<br />
<br />
About midnight, Dawn started arranging &quot;fun and games&quot; to keep the party from going stale.<br />
First she had all the women together in a giant circle to enjoy each other&#39;s charms. Last one to come was the &quot;winner&quot; and got to chose the man she wanted for her first partner of the next round.<br />
William was the lucky were who got to have anal sex with the cougar.<br />
About 3am, Dawn had all the men sit in a row of chairs as they were all blindfolded.<br />
The ladies then each had one minute with each male, going down the row, displaying their oral talents and seeing how quickly they could have each man make a sperm deposit in their mouth. When the last woman had finished sampling the last man, the &quot;survivors&quot; faced another round as the women started the process all over again.<br />
The &quot;winner&quot; (last one to come, of course) was the werewolf, who chose Martha to have a howling good time to start the next round with.<br />
<br />
The only real &quot;downer&quot; of the party was about 6 that Sunday morning, as Dawn called a break and insisted that every female present take their respective were birth control pill.<br />
All the ladies complied, although all had to go back upstairs to where they discarded their clothes and purses to do so.<br />
During this break, Douglas recruited William to help him set up a serving table of cold cuts and other sandwich fixings in the basement.<br />
Refreshments had been available all night long, when Douglas could be pulled away from his own fun to keep the table stocked, and the basement had its own bathroom.<br />
By 7:30, the all night long orgy had resumed once more and looked like it would last until at least that afternoon at the rate things were going.<br />
<br />
While everyone had dozed here or there during the night, none had ever outright retired for the night.<br />
All were full of pent up (stress) energy and had plenty to use participating in what some joked was a were&#39;s favorite past time: rutting.<br />
As the basement wall clock silently announced it was 9 AM, all of Martha&#39;s current partners left her for other pursuits.<br />
She laid there on the carpeted basement floor happy and content, when she heard a familiar voice say, &quot;Hey there you sexy beauty. Got time for me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Always,&quot; Martha happily told her husband, as William moved into the classic 69 position so they could orally enjoy each other.<br />
The fact that for whatever scientific reason(s), weres were immune from all sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS (unless they were exposed to a contaminated needle from either acquiring a tattoo* or illegal drugs) never entered the Andersons&#39; minds.<br />
All they cared about was that, after each gave the other the thrill of orgasmic bliss, they happily fell asleep in each others&#39; arms.<br />
