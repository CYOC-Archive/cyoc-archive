<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Merlin journeyed through realities searching for the secret to Samantha’s Samoan ancestry Kellie pondered what she should do. She was quite distressed over the fact Mary Elise and Claudia were no longer friends in this reality. Previously the two very very close before Claudia and Mika became an item. Kellies problem now was sitting down with her.<br />
<br />
Claudia had mostly kept to herself when she had been introduced to the girls. While the others had been friendly towards Kellie Claudia had let the others do most of the talking. Kellie had considered trying to call the girl however that would seem to forward and possibly alienate her even more from Claudia. As she stared out her window an idea came into her head. “It’s not that far of a walk,” she muttered. Grabbing a jacket Kellie now began the journey towards Claudia’s home.<br />
<br />
The walk, while long, was uneventful for Kellie. As she now gazed at the Harris home she smiled, she immediately realized that it was Claudia’s home when she noticed Marjorie Harris exit her car with some groceries. The Marjorie Harris of this reality was slightly younger than previously also. The woman was still older than the other girls parents but she was now 50 instead of 55. Kellie now saw Marjorie call for her daughter to help as she did Kellie could see Claudia make her way out to car. “Good a chance as any,” Kellie thought as she made her way towards the home.<br />
<br />
Claudia sighed as she returned to the car for another arm load of groceries. The girl was only too happy to help but had been hoping to have some quiet time with her dad. As she picked up a few more grocery bags she noticed a honey blond girl slowly walking towards her waving. “Ummm hi,” Claudia said meekly. “Can I help you?”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled warmly as she approached. “She looks almost scared of me,” Kellie thought as she looked at Claudia. Taking a breath Kellie smiled as she looked at Claudia. “Clauida right,” she said warmly. “Hi I was just out for a walk. Didn’t know you lived here, it’s nice.”<br />
<br />
“Uh Thanks,” Claudia said quietly. “Umm sorry I...I um was just heading back inside. I...I promised my parents I would help with dinner.” Kellie nodded as she looked at the girl, she wanted to get to know this version of Claudia and realized she needed to keep her talking.<br />
<br />
“Oh nice,” she said as she approached Claudia. “Here let me help you with those.” Claudia stammered as Kellie Ickes up the remaining groceries in the trunk. “Y..you don’t have to do that,” Claudia stammered. Kellie smiled as she hoisted them into her arms. “It’s no trouble,” She shrugged. “I’m stronger than I look besides kinda want to get to know you better, we didn’t get much of a chance to talk.” Claudia nodded quietly and smiled as the two girls made their way into Claudia’s home.<br />
<br />
As the two girls made their way inside Kellie could see Marjorie Harris smiling from the kitchen. “Oh Clauida sis this a new friend of yours,” she asked. “This isn’t Kellie mom she’s new,” she answered. Marjorie smiled as she now took the groceries from Kellie and Claudia. “Thank you girls,” she said warmly turning to Claudia. “Honey I’m going to start getting dinner ready, can you help your father? He’s in his study.”<br />
<br />
Claudia nodded as she quickly made her way towards her fathers study. Kellie trailed behind curious to see how this realities Tom Harris looked. As Claudia opened the door Kellie gasped. “oh no,” she thought.<br />
<br />
Tom Harris struggled to get out of the chair he sat in. The giant of a man was covered in battle scars from his service in the military. Tom’s face had several deep scars on it while his right eye was missing. As Kellie looked him over she could see that his left arm was paralyzed, hanging limply at his side. As Tom now tried to walk toward Claudia he stumbled. Kellie looked to see that Toms right leg had been replaced with a prosthetic one just above the knee. “Daddy please let me help you,” Claudia implored as she raced towards her father. Tom smiled weakly as his daughter now tried to support his weight. <br />
<br />
“You and your mother worry too much,” he said. “I can still walk around my own home unassisted.” Kellie watched as Claudia frowned up at her father. “I know daddy but I still worry about you.”<br />
<br />
Kellie watched as the girl now helped her father to the kitchen table. As she did Tom looked over at Kellie with his one good eye. “So Claudia whose your friend,” he asked. Claudia turned blushing slightly as she realized she had forgotten Kellie was here. “I’m sorry daddy this is Kellie,” she whispered. “She’s...um...new. She helped bring in the groceries.”<br />
<br />
Kellie waved politely as Tom smiled. “Pleasure to meet you,” Tom said warmly. “Claudia usually doesn’t have a lot of friends over. She’s always nervous that they will disturb me.”<br />
<br />
“I just want you to rest daddy,” she said meekly.<br />
<br />
Tom smiled at his youngest daughter before turning to Kellie. “Don’t mind Claudia she always worries about me,” she said warmly. “Always the responsible one in the family, looking out for her old man.”<br />
<br />
Claudia smiled at her father before turning towards Kellie. Kellie watched as Claudia looked at Kellie sternly. “Can I talk to you for a minute?”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded and followed Claudia into the living room. The mousy blond girl now sighed as she looked at Kellie. “So what we’re doing in my neighborhood,” she asked narrowing her eyes. Kellie put her hands up defensively as she looked at her. “I was just taking a walk, I was bored at home and decided to explore.”<br />
<br />
Claudia looked Kellie over critically before sighing sadly and sitting down. “Okay,” she said sadly. “Sorry, I...I really don’t like anyone coming over. My...my dad.....he....got hurt real bad while he was in the marines. One time someone was over it didn’t go so well.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as she now turned this bit of information over in her head. “I’m so...so sorry,” she said. “What happened..if you don’t mind me asking?”<br />
<br />
Claudia hung her head as she looked at the floor. “Dad used to be a marine,” she groaned. “On his last deployment his regiment came under mortar fire. He...he got caught in an explosion and....” Clauida trailed off as she started to cry. Kellie could feel her heart breaking for the girl, slowly she approached her hugging her tightly. “Oh god Claudia I’m so, so, sorry,” she whispered.<br />
<br />
Claudia sniffed as she returned the girls hug. “Thanks,” she whispered. “It’s..it’s been awhile since anyone actually came over. The others know about daddy but I try not to have them over too often. I...I had a bad experience once.”<br />
<br />
Kellies eyes bulged as she put the pieces together. “Mary,” she thought. “Something happened with Mary Elise the last time she was here.”<br />
<br />
Kellie stroked the girls hair as Claudia cried anew. “It’s okay,” she soothed. “Your dad is ok and he seems really nice.”<br />
<br />
Clauida gave a short laugh as she wiped her eyes. “Thanks but daddy can be a bit of a pain,” she smirked. “He’s so stubborn sometimes. Everyone always says we’re exactly the same but I don’t see it.” Kellie stifled a giggle as she looked at the sad girl. In the previous reality the fiery and spunky girl was a pint sized version of her dad. Both he and Claudia were larger than life presences that commanded respect. It appeared than in this new reality Toms injuries had traumatized a young Claudia. As a result Claudia had become a meek and mousy girl after seeing her father (who she considered invincible) hurt so badly.<br />
<br />
Kellie cupped her hand under Claudia’s chin as she smiled down at her. “Well it was a pleasure to meet him,” she smiled. Claudia seemed to brighten slightly as she wiped her eyes and stood up. “Well I appreciate you helping with the groceries,” she said. “You know if you want we were about to cook dinner. I usually don’t invite anyone but I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t mind.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled at Claudia before answering. “Dinner sounds great,” Smiling the two girls now walked towards the kitchen to help Marjorie with preparations.</p>
