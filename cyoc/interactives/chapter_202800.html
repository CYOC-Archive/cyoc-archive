<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff felt his dick harden at the horny ideas flooding his head at want he could do with this. Jeff first selected himself and thought of what to turn himself into/ what to do to himself. He thought about it for awhile, but found his thoughts turning to his bestfriend who had recently gotten a girlfriend. He felt a bit jealous, but an idea came to him, he could merge with the both of them so he wouldn&#39;t feel jealous. He then thought of what to merge into.<br />
<br />
He was always interested in Cerberus the guard dog of hell. He thought what better thing to turn into and he was always interested in the female sex and what pleasure felt for them, so he decided they would become a hermaphroditic Cerberus. <br />
<br />
Target: Jeff, Jenny, and Kyle<br />
Type of changes: Merge, Species, and Body<br />
Gender: hermaphrodite <br />
Species: Anthro Cerberus<br />
Breasts: 8 tits, top pair C-cups, 2nd pair B-cups, 3rd and 4th pair A-cups<br />
Left head Jenny, right head Kyle.<br />
<br />
Jeff made it so Jenny was their female head while Kyle would be the male head and Jeff himself would be the one in control of their body. Jeff altered Jenny&#39;s and Kyle&#39;s memories into thinking they used the Chronivac to become what they were and any thing Jeff would change before hitting enter and confirming the changes.<br />
<br />
With his change out of the way, before he actually changes Jeff decided it was best to alter his family as well. <br />
<br />
He selected his little sister Susan next and change her into a three headed horny goblin chick. He altered her mind as well so she would love Him, soon to be Her?, Hir? He would figure it out later. As he thought he might as well change it so his family was okay with incest and immune to any ill effects from it. <br />
<br />
Now onto his father Gabriel. Jeff thought his father should be his mother instead, his sexy dominate mother, but first what multi-headed creature should he turn his father into. Jeff thought about it for some time and figured what he should turn his father into. Jeff decided to turn his father into a hydra. He didn&#39;t know how many heads a hydra had so he quickly searched it up. He learned they have 9 heads which got Jeff thinking.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to not only alter his father in the present, but also his past. He wanted his father to be aware he was a human man before the change, but remember giving birth to Jeff and his goblin sister. Jeff decided his father should change like him in that he merged with people to become what he would become. <br />
<br />
Jeff decided that the captain and vice-captain of the cheerleaders team during his parents time in highschool, the captain and vice-captain of the basketball team, 2 slutty streamers and 2 porn-actresses, would merge with his father the moment he married. The girls that merge with his dad merged because the love him and wanted to teach him the pleasures of the female form. Of course he plans on doing something similar to his mother soon to be father. He also thought it would be fun to turn his father into a more sexy Hydra by adding succubus DNA. <br />
<br />
Target: Gabriel<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Species: Succubus-Hydra hybrid.  <br />
Main head: Gabriel: succubus, other heads are dragon heads<br />
Breasts: 8, top pair H-cups, 2nd pair G-cups, 3rd pair F-cups, bottom pair E-cups.<br />
Special extra: has a toned body and tail pussy.<br />
<br />
Jeff then selected his mother Emily. Like his father now mother he altered her past so she would merge with her two best friends who loved Gabriel as well. Emily and her friends agreed since they loved him they should merge so they could be with him after they learned of the other women who loved and merged with him. <br />
<br />
Target: Emily<br />
Gender: hermaphrodite<br />
Species: Were-wolf Cerberus<br />
Breasts: 8 tits in Were-wolf form, normal in human. all pairs are B-cups.<br />
<br />
He decided to give a slight delay to the changes so he could be downstairs and see his family before the change and after. He confirmed all the changes and made his way downstairs. <br />
<br />
He saw his mother Emily, his father Gabriel, and his little sister Susan in the living room. He then felt the changes hit. Hir grew a few inches more and felt hir shoulders broaden as Jenny and Kyles canine heads popped into existence. Hir felt as hir head changed, hir head becoming that of a dogs. Hir body became covered in black and brown fur. Hir tits popped into existence, hir cock lengthen and became canine while hir balls were sucked in and a vagina opened into existence. <br />
<br />
The newly born Jeff (they kept his name since this is what their parents name them) looked at Hir sister as she became a three headed goblin. Jeff noticed that hir sister had the body of a bimbo. <br />
<br />
They then turned their attention to Gabriel their soon to be mother. Like everyone they kept their names the same since Jeff forgot to change them. <br />
<br />
They saw Gabriel grew to 7 feet tall and his body quickly feminized. Gabriel quickly was a She and her body became incredibly curvaceous. Her large tits came into existence growing to their large sizes. She grew red scales in very tasteful locations on her body. Her eyes turned red as her hair turned blonde. a large dragon tail came out from above her large round ass, her belly was visible despite her large tits and she had a six pack. then from her shoulders and back came out long scaled necks that held the draconic heads of the women who merged with him. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt Hir cock harden at the site of hir sexy new mom. It was also clear to Hir thanks to her new enhance sense of smell that they can tell their mother is wet with arousal. Jeff also realized they were naked and almost in response to hir thoughts Gabriel was covered in lingerie that did nothing to hide her sexy figure. Susan got a pink bikini that matched her hair and plumb lips, while Jeff got lingerie like hir mother. <br />
<br />
Jeff turned to Emily who quickly became a three headed Herm. Emily didn&#39;t change much since she was a Were and would only change during the night. Besides the two extra heads the only other thing that changed was that she was now sporting a large cock between her legs. Unlike the rest of them Emily remained in her none lewd dress.<br />
<br />
Jeff, Jenny, and Kyle thought of what to do now with their sexy Multi-headed family.</p>
