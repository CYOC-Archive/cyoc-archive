<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chotsalak (the real one) nearly fell over. &quot;How did *that* happen?!&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know!&quot; Trepeeset cried frantically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have to fix this!&quot; Chotsalak said, snatching the medallion from Trepeeset's hand. He held it up against his clone's chest. &quot;Change back to horse! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The former horse, meanwhile, had learned how to balance himself on two legs, work his arms and fingers, and walk around. He grabbed Chotsalak's elbow and removed himself from contact with the medallion. &quot;No,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean no!?&quot; It was a bizarre image to Trepeeset, his best friend staring into his mirror image, with both naked and both looking angry at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horse dumb animal. I want to be human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know? You've only been a human for a few moments!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's got human instincts now,&quot; Trepeeset said. &quot;I think I know what happened. I was stroking him with the medallion in my hand, and he thought about you because you were in front of him. That's how he transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But my hair is not in there,&quot; Chotsalak said, pointing at the amulet. &quot;How was he able to become me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess once you use it once, anyone can use that form forever. That's good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, you can't be human,&quot; Chotsalak complained to the former horse after glaring daggers at Trepeeset. &quot;I am Chotsalak. There cannot be two of us.&quot; Trepeeset thought it was funny to hear Chotsalak trying to convince something to not be a horse when he himself had stolen Trepeeset's medallion just so he could turn into a horse for the night. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hate being horse,&quot; the other Chotsalak stated, crossing his arms. &quot;So boring. Humans bad to me. Sick of grass. Don't want to go back to horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't blame him,&quot; Trepeeset said. &quot;All horses do is stand around all day and get whipped when they don't do what we want. If I were a horse, I would wish to be a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he's me!&quot; Chotsalak cried. &quot;Come on! Help me persuade him to change!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Trepeeset said. &quot;Look, horses are great animals,&quot; Trepeeset said to the former horse. &quot;You do not have to work. You do not war with other tribes. Your kind does not kill each other. And besides,&quot; Trepeeset pointed to Chotsalak's penis. &quot;Do you really want to go through life with that thing when you know what you used to have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak sputtered for a few seconds, then said &quot;Please, friend. Can't you help us out and let everything go back to normal? Change back to horse for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
The former horse simply shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it!&quot; Chotsalak swore in a rage. &quot;I'll kill it!&quot; he cried, lunging at his double. Looking scared, the former horse turned and began to run away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!&quot; Trepeeset cried, restraining Chotsalak. &quot;Come back! I have a plan!&quot; The former horse slowed to a stop but stayed where it was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here. Don't move a muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? What are you going to do?&quot; Chotsalak demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see.&quot; Trepeeset sighed. &quot;I'm not going to be proud of this.&quot;  Trepeeset took off in a sprint towards another group of horses. He hopped a fence to come across a large herd of brown mares. They all turned to look at him. Trepeeset circled around the group, looking for something specific. After a few minutes of searching, he found it. He patted the mare's back and rubbed her belly, saying &quot;Good girl.&quot; Looking at her backside, Trepeeset could see that her opening and closing vulva were moist. Continuing to pat the large beast, Trepeeset cut off some of its hair with his teeth. It chuffed angrily and Trepeeset pulled away, petting it one last time. He then sprinted back over the fence. <br />
<br />
He couldn't believe what he was about to do. Trepeeset popped open his medallion and dropped in the hair. As he closed it, he placed it in between his lips and concentrated. Naturally, his face was the first to change. It bulged outward and his teeth grew in his mouth, nearly causing him to drop the medallion. As brown fur grew all over his body, his ears leapt to the top of his head and his nose grew wide. Trepeeset felt thick hair growing on his back as his spine lengthened, making him very tall. But this was not for long, as his arms grew and his balance shifted. His middle fingers and toes grew and thickened, absorbing the other digits. The nails on each became black and grew immensely, becoming hooves. As the tail worked its way out, Trepeeset felt the part he was dreading. He was just glad he couldn't see it. His penis and testicles shrunk and pulled back into his still expanding body, and at the same time he felt an opening in his hindquarters. He was a mare. She.<br />
<br />
It was a bizarre feeling, but she didn't have time to savor it. Trepeeset turned her new enormous body towards a pair of wide-eyed Chotsalaks. As she did, she felt a warmth in her hindquarters, and the lips begin to twitch. She was a mare in heat.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset galloped towards the former horse. Before he got there, he made eye contact with Chotsalak and threw her head in his direction, tossing the medallion. She then focused her attention on Galk'hey. The horny mare in her didn't understand how this puny thing could satisfy her needs, but Trepeeset was able to overpower the instincts. <br />
<br />
The same could not be said of Chotsalak's clone. He had a quickly growing erection, the mare's pheromones still tickling his equine instincts. He slammed his face into Trepeeset's rear and deeply inhaled, then pulled back and curled his upper lip in a very horse-like manner. He began to hump her rear, but his cock couldn't reach. <br />
<br />
Chotsalak snapped out of his shock to realize what Trepeeset wanted him to do. He grabbed the medallion off the ground and ran towards the pair. Chotsalak held the medallion up against Galk'hey's back. The former stallion was so desperate it didn't take long from there. The paint stallion ripped out of the Native American body, and in one fluid motion, mounted Trepeeset. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, Trepeeset!&quot; Chotsalak shouted, holding the medallion against the brown mare's flank. &quot;It changed back! Now you change back before you get --&quot; Chotsalak's voice trailed off as Galk'hey let out a loud whinny and penetrated Trepeeset.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset's eyes grew wide as the stallion's shaft went in and out. She whinnied as her inner muscles clamped down to enhance the sensation of the rapidly-enlarging penis. The feeling wracked Trepeeset's body, nearly causing him to pass out from pleasure. There was one more thrust, then Galk'hey released his hot seed into Trepeeset. Trepeeset also had an orgasm, causing her to let out a loud moan/whinny. <br />
<br />
The stallion's penis softened, and he slipped back down to the ground. He was back to the way he started, a complete stallion, mentally and physically. Trepeeset was too wrapped up in her first female orgasm to even move. She allowed the glowing sensation to bounce through every cell of her body, having no idea that the female's role in sex was so satisfying. She calmly walked away, feeling the cum dripping from her vulva, with a flummoxed Chotsalak.  <br />
<br />
Trepeeset glanced down to see the large erection Chotsalak was sporting, and she mentally grinned. She had such a good time on the other side of the process, maybe there was time in the future for some fun with his friend. Trepeeset began the transformation back to Indian male to get over the fence. Even when his male sex organs returned, the glowing feeling Trepeeset had did not go away. The two boys, both naked and very erect, glanced at each other as they walked out of the horse pasture and towards their home.</p>
