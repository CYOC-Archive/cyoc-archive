<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa was awakened by the alarm clock. Although she felt rested, she still thought it felt too early. And on the weekend, at that! Well, it&#39;s my own plan, she thought. Time to wake up Ty. She started rubbing a spot near the middle of the body pillow with one hand, and a spot on one bed pillow with the other. Ty obviously knew what she had in mind, as after a moment those two pillows grew large hard cocks, and she started riding and deep-throating again.<br />
<br />
This time, after they both had come, rather than dismount, she transformed him back to his human form, which she was still straddling. She started riding him again, and he started thrusting. &quot;An excellent way to wake up,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
When they finished, they showered, got dressed, and went down to the living room. Lisa changed her hair to blond, and Ty conjured up the zig-zag boxes and blades. Lisa stepped into the box, and Ty inserted the blades. This time, with no one else watching, they didn&#39;t do the theatrics. The blades didn&#39;t meet any resistance, there was no blood, and Lisa didn&#39;t feign any pain. Ty separated the three parts, as he had done in the live performance, moving the middle box containing her midsection (neck to waist) a few feet to the side, and leaving it in midair, then moving the lower part a few feet further, and raising it to float in midair as well.<br />
<br />
While they waited for Lisa&#39;s parents, Ty stood near the top box, containing Lisa&#39;s head, and they chatted. &quot;I do have some homework to do for the coming week,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I&#39;d like to &#39;cheat&#39; on it again, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Ty replied, &quot;but I thought we decided that it wasn&#39;t cheating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I call it that for short, for lack of a better term for doing it in my app form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I want to &#39;cheat&#39; for mine as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could do that at the same time,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;When you give me, as the app, instructions, you can order me to turn back when I&#39;m finished with my homework. If you don&#39;t turn yourself back when you&#39;ve completed yours, I can turn you back. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems like a good idea,&quot; Ty said, &quot;but what if someone knocks on the bedroom door while we&#39;re both in app form?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn, I hadn&#39;t thought of that. Can you program one of us to transform back if that happens?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. We&#39;d better test that with just one of us, first.&quot;<br />
<br />
They heard Maria and Diego coming down the stairs. Maria went straight to the kitchen, not passing through the living room. Diego entered the living room and said, &quot;Good morning, Ty,&quot; before he noticed Lisa&#39;s split form. He did a double take. &quot;And Lisa,&quot; he added. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just practicing the act,&quot; Lisa&#39;s head said from one box, as she lifted her arm and waved from another.<br />
<br />
&quot;We might try to come up with new variations of this illusion,&quot; Ty added.<br />
<br />
Diego walked around them, and looked at Lisa&#39;s separate sections. He passed a hand below and above the box containing her midsection. &quot;May I... May I touch you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, OK, I guess,&quot; Lisa said awkwardly.<br />
<br />
Diego touched Lisa&#39;s right calf.  He moved his hand around a little, convincing himself that her leg felt real. He moved to a the middle box and felt her side. Then he moved to the top box, and touched her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is absolutely amazing,&quot; Diego said. &quot;Maria,&quot; he called, &quot;you should come see this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea how this is done,&quot; Diego continued, &quot;but I assumed that the illusion was only visual, and would fall apart on close-up examination. That&#39;s obviously not the case.&quot; He continued walking around the boxes, feeling around them trying to find any sign of trickery.<br />
<br />
Maria entered the room and gasped. She walked up to the top box, and said, &quot;It&#39;s one thing to see this from a distance in a theater, and another thing entirely to see it up close in one&#39;s own home. I&#39;m not sure I like it. And I don&#39;t just mean your hair color. I could get used to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty said, &quot;Let me put her back together, and then she can perform the illusion with me as the subject.&quot; He removed her lower body (waist down) from the bottom box, and stood that section up outside the box. Diego looked closely. Her clothing was cut at the waist. Looking at her body where the cut through her waist was, he saw only her smooth skin.<br />
<br />
Maria was still a bit freaked out, but she moved beside Diego, and touched the waist cut. She moved her hand around a bit, and Lisa said, &quot;Ooh, that tickles!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty pulled her midsection (neck to waist) from the middle box, set it atop her waist, and it was instantly joined. &quot;The duct tape and glue was just theatrics,&quot; he explained. He waved his arm, and the cut through her clothing knitted itself back together.<br />
<br />
Diego looked at her neck cut, which, as with her waist, covered by smooth skin.&quot;This is impossible,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; said Ty, as he collected Lisa&#39;s head and set it on her neck, rejoining them. Lisa smiled, stepped over to the sofa, and sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen enough,&quot; said Maria. &quot;I&#39;m going back to making breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stacked the boxes back up, and removed the blades. As he was doing so, he gradually changed his height to match Lisa&#39;s, so that the splits between the boxes would line up with his neck and waist. He handed the blades to Lisa, and said. &quot;If you would do the honors...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa proceeded to split Ty with the blades, separate the boxes, and arrange them exactly as Ty had done with her, all boxes then being unsupported in mid-air. &quot;See, Lisa has learned to perform this illusion, too,&quot; Ty&#39;s head said.<br />
<br />
Diego walked around again, scrutinizing the boxes and Ty, though he didn&#39;t touch him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must know how this is done!&quot; he said. &quot;Will you please tell me? I promise to keep it secret!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa said, &quot;Magician&#39;s Code, Dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked at Lisa. &quot;Should we tell him?&quot; he asked. &quot;Would he keep our secret?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s up to you,&quot; Lisa said, &quot;but yes, if Dad makes a promise, he keeps it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll think about it over breakfast,&quot; Ty said. &quot;Meanwhile, would you please put me back together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if Diego helps?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I trust you both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa moved Ty&#39;s lower section out of the box. She had Diego take Ty&#39;s midsection from the middle box, and set it in place on his waist. The sections joined seamlessly, exactly as Lisa&#39;s had. Lisa finished reassembling him.<br />
<br />
Ty thanked them, then waved his arm, and the boxes and blades vanished. &quot;Let&#39;s go see if we can help Maria with breakfast,&quot; he said to Lisa. As the two walked into the kitchen, Ty gradually restored his height to normal.</p>
