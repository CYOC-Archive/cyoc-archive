<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa watched the battle unfold on some monitors in the room she and the others were in. The tear gas wouldn't touch them in here but they had gas masks just in case the military guys made it to this room and used tear gas in here. She was thankful that this room was sealed off from the rest of the compound and underground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell who's winning&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; Lisa said. The tear gas was obscuring the video but they could hear the gun fire. The military guys seemed to be using fully automatic weapons. Lisa knew that that would give them the advantage. Fortunately she had pointed out that should war break out that they would be facing fully automated fire and Dan was able to come up with strategies for that. Now his strategies were being put to the test.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think they'll find us here?&quot; Daisy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Lisa admitted. &quot;We tried to hide this room as best we could but they may find us anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Emily came up to Lisa and said &quot;I'm scared. I want my daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you do Emily&quot; Lisa said. &quot;If all goes as we hope you'll see him soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly one of the monitors showed nothing but static. Lisa replayed the last few seconds and saw an explosion close by the camera. She looked at the other monitors and saw some more explosions.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like they're using mortars&quot; Daisy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it does&quot; Lisa agreed.<br />
<br />
They continued to watch the battle on the monitors<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Mama Williams was having a hard time seeing through the tear gas. All she was able to see was dark shapes flitting about through it. She had no idea if they were friend or foe. She was afraid that they were losing this battle. There were explosions erupting all around her. The only good thing now was the tear gas was clearing. They must have used all of their canisters right at the start. That was a foolish move. Of course the order to put on their gas masks came over the compounds loudspeakers so they could have decided that it<br />
wouldn't be an effective strategy.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Mama saw a shadow close by and there was a laser beam emitting from it. She knew that there were no guns in the compound that had laser sights on them. 'That's just stupid' she thought. 'Using a laser sight when there's still tear gas in the air.'<br />
<br />
The laser sight swung toward them and settled on Sharonda. Mama didn't think. She aimed and pulled the trigger. Whoever it was went down. Mama was sad that it had come to this but she would protect her daughters at all costs. If she had to kill to do it she would and she just did.<br />
<br />
From out of nowhere Mama felt a bullet bury itself in her left shoulder. They must have a sniper out there. She turned to Sharonda to check on her only to find that a bullet had found the center of her forehead.<br />
<br />
Tears ran down Mama's face as she looked for a target. She found three military guys advancing on her position. They didn't want to be in Mama's sights right now. She knew that Sharonda could be brought back but it still hurt to see her dead.<br />
<br />
Mama fired three times and two of the three went down. The third brought up her rifle, Mama could see that the third soldier was female, to fire but she was dropped by someone else.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Back in the bunker Lisa watched as a sniper's bullet hit Mama and killed Sharonda. The tear gas had just about cleared by now. Suddenly one one of the monitors Lisa saw four soldiers near the entrance to the hall leading to the bunker. She signaled to the four others with guns in the room. They immediately trained their rifles on the door waiting to see if they would come in.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes they did find their way into the hall. In seconds they were at the door. All of a sudden they retreated back up the hall. There was only one reason they would do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take cover!&quot; Lisa shouted moments before the door blew in.<br />
<br />
The soldiers came in firing and Lisa was hit a couple of times before she fired herself. She saw that she had taken one down before another shot found her heart.<br />
<br />
It was a strange feeling. Lisa felt the pain but it was like she was full of Novocain. She hit the floor and saw two of the other defenders hit the floor. The gunfire in the room stopped and she heard Emily crying by her. She knew that she was dead and that she had stopped breathing. She felt her bladder and bowels let go. She thought 'Don't cry Emily. I can be brought back to life with the crystals.' Her vision started to go black and before she lost consciousness she heard Dan say over the loudspeakers &quot;We have won this battle. Our foes have withdrawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa lost consciousness thinking 'We may have won this battle but the war is just beginning.'</p>
