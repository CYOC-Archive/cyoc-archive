<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I didn&#39;t know why I was doing it. I&#39;d entered this store just to see if I could use their phone, since my cell phone had died. But instead I&#39;d found myself drawn over to the women&#39;s clothing section, for no reason I could explain. There was no reason I should be over here, yet I was. It wasn&#39;t like it was against my will, exactly - I didn&#39;t feel like I was being forced, there was just this gap between what I was doing and what I could offer myself any explanation for.<br />
<br />
That gap only widened further when I found myself browsing the racks. There was no reason for this. I didn&#39;t normally have an interest in this kind of thing. Why was I here? My gaze came to rest on a hanger which held a light jacket. It was striped with a dark purple and charcoal grey, the contrast between the two so minor than you might not notice it was patterned at all from a distance. Without even thinking about it, I plucked it off the rack, and only a little nagging voice in the back of my head that said <i>What are you going to say if someone says something?</i> reminded me that there was still no reason for this to be happening.<br />
<br />
I started looking through the women&#39;s jeans, also without any good reason. This was so peculiar; it was like I was on autopilot, yet I didn&#39;t feel deprived of control. I just...wasn&#39;t stopping, and I didn&#39;t know why. It was like some kind of fugue state, yet I was perfectly conscious of everything I was doing. I settled on a simple pair of black jeans, not too skinny, but nicely cut, and took them off the rack as well.<br />
<br />
Why <i>was</i> I doing this? I couldn&#39;t understand it. If anybody had asked me why I had picked out a woman&#39;s jacket and jeans, why I was grabbing a white babydoll tee off the rack, why I was heading back to the changing rooms, I couldn&#39;t have even begun to explain it to them. Fortunately for me, no-one was around to take notice, and I slipped into one of the stalls, closing the door behind me.<br />
<br />
With just as little fanfare and just as little understanding of <i>why</i> as everything that had come before, I pulled off my shoes, pants, and shirt, and took the T-shirt off the hanger. Despite the fact that it should&#39;ve been too small for me, I slid it over my head and down my torso with ease, pulling it snugly into place. The neckline came down to a little below my collarbone. Then I unclipped the hanger from the jeans, stepped into them, and slid them up my legs, having just as little trouble with the fact that there was no way they should&#39;ve fit. I tucked the shirt into the waistband.<br />
<br />
Then, finally, I removed the jacket and slid first one arm and then the other into the sleeves. The inside was soft and cottony and it fit me snugly. I zipped it up most of the way, leaving it open just a little below the neckline of the shirt, still with no idea of why I was doing any of this.<br />
<br />
Then I blinked.<br />
<br />
For that fraction of a second that my eyes were closed, I felt a sudden jar in the continuity of things. Not like a record skip, more like a single dropped frame on a video player - just the smallest, most barely perceptible slip. I looked up.<br />
<br />
Reflected back at me in the mirror of the changing stall was a girl of about eighteen or nineteen. She was short, not particularly curvy, and a bit small in the chest; it was mostly her hips and face that made it clear that she was a young woman and not a fourteen-year-old girl. She had short, loosely-arranged black hair and a soft, pensive face, and wore dark-rimmed glasses, a white T-shirt, black jeans, and a purple-and-grey jacket.<br />
<br />
And the spell was broken.<br />
<br />
I stared. This couldn&#39;t be real. I raised my hand, and she raised her hand. I ran a hand down my womanly ass, and she did the same. I cupped my new breasts, smallish but still appreciably <i>there</i>, and I could see her lifting the weight that I felt my own hands lifting, and felt being lifted by my own hands. Pulling the collar of the shirt out, I looked down to see them in there, supported by a plain white brassiere. I gingerly felt around the crotch of my pants, and there was no mistaking it. Somehow, I had become a girl. <i>This</i> girl.<br />
<br />
No longer in the fugue state that had brought me in here, but still too dazed to do much in the way of panicking, I looked around the stall. There were my own clothes; I had the brief idea of putting them on and seeing if they changed me back, but then I noticed the shape and strap of a purse peeking out from under them. Already guessing, I picked them up. Sure enough, they had changed - still loose-fitting blue jeans and a nondescript black T-shirt, but smaller and cut for a woman. I looked down to see my shoes, also changed to fit my smaller feet. That was out, then - but what could I do now?<br />
<br />
Still dazed, I slipped on my shoes, folded my clothes and slipped them into what must be my purse, and exited the changing room. I made my way up to the checkout counter, where a girl was working the register. &quot;E-excuse me,&quot; I said, hearing my new quiet alto for the first time, then stopped. What was I going to <i>say?</i> &quot;Pardon me, but I went into a fugue state and put on some of your women&#39;s clothing and was transformed into a girl?&quot; She&#39;d think I was crazy...wouldn&#39;t she? Unless this was some sort of magic store and she knew what this stuff did...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;Everything fit alright, miss...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah—Erin,&quot; I said, the name coming unbidden to my lips, with just as little explanation as any of this. What <i>was</i> I going to tell her?</p>
