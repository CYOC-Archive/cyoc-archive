<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But Professor is it fair to do to that lady what you just did?&quot; asked Frank as they marched up the stairs.<br />
<br />
The Professor looked back at Frank, then from down below came the moaning and grunting of two goats deep the the pleasure of bestial sex. &quot;I suppose it was more expedient than necessary, but from the sounds below I'd say she has more than accepted her new way of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they reached the flight deck a pretty blonde Stewardess asked, &quot;Is Melody coming back up soon we will be landing in 30 minutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Professor was about to answer as Frank stepped between him and her as he offered his answer, &quot;She is stowing some things which fell down and I'm sure what she's doing right now will be finished very soon!&quot;<br />
<br />
A grin from the Professor to Frank and the two went back to their seats. The flight crew was busy collecting trays as the Blonde Stewardess kept looking forward for Melody to return upstairs. As minutes passed and the &quot;Fasten Seatbelt&quot; sign glowed bright the Professor was being stared at by the young blonde.<br />
<br />
The screech of tires touching down made Frank sigh with relief. The Professor looked over at him and smiled. &quot;We're home, lets get through Customs and be on our way!&quot; said the Professor.<br />
<br />
A nod of agreement from Frank as he looked out the window still feeling regret for the Stewardess down in the hold with her buck.<br />
<br />
Doors opened and people began to pickup their belongings as Students and their Professor moved to the head of the line. The young blonde Stewardess stood nearest the exiting door and continued to give a stare at both Frank and the Professor.<br />
<br />
Bending forward as the Professor passed the young lady said, &quot;I haven't seen Melody yet, and unless she comes up soon I plan to call security before your party clears Customs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank looked scared as Hell, while the other students continued to bash their return so early from the dig and the strange enjoyments they all learned to enjoy. The Professor leaned forward too and as his right hand grasp the Medallion he said, &quot;If you go downstairs to the hold you might look inside the crate marked &quot;Send to Wisc. Univ. after quarantined&quot; it is about eight foot by eight and offers much explanation. I'm sure you will be happy once you learn the joy Melody is feeling at this moment!&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly the Stewardess broke from her position at the door of that plane and rushed to the stairs leading down to the baggage and hold.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done Professor?&quot; asked Frank as he heard the sneering words to the Stewardess.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't afford all these interruptions! If she looks into the crate she will see two Brazilian Mountain goats doing what comes natural. Yet if she ventures inside the crate to ask or inquire at close range she will find herself a willing part of the new herd!&quot; said the Professor as they began to walk up the gangway.<br />
<br />
Peering around the corner stood a scared young Stewardess as she called Melody's name. In the dull light she saw the crated stallion his eyes showing whites as it watched her through the openings in the slats.<br />
<br />
Walking the corridor she worked her way along to where the sounds on moaning and rough grunting seemed to come. There in a far corner was a 8' x 8' x 4' wooden crate. As she knelt down to peer inside the slats she could see a big Mountain goat with long curving horns mounted over the shaggy rump of what she thought looked like a nanny goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melody?&quot; called the young Blonde.<br />
<br />
As the name flowed into the crate a goat being fucked silly turned from her dominated stance and looked backward to see her caller.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleat, bleat, bleat!&quot; said the nanny and then a sensual groan as the big buck thrust hard forward as he worked his tool.<br />
<br />
It was crazy but the young Stewardess called again, &quot;Melody it's me Georgia!&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the nanny goat bleated and with her mate high aboard she turned and stepped closer to Georgia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bleat, Baaaaaaaaaaaa!&quot; roared from the narrow mouth of the severely dominated nanny goat.<br />
<br />
Georgia sat and looked at the two goats. Thinking to herself that Melody was not anywhere to be found and here was a nanny goat answering to Melody when she was called.  Slowly young fingers unlatched the goat crate and opening the door she reached to touch the nanny's face.<br />
<br />
A screaming bleat came from the nanny goat as the big buck looked down and showing his very front teeth almost smiled.<br />
<br />
Instantly a burning sensation began in Georgia's chest and as she clutched her hand to her right bleat she felt it decrease in size. In a slow motion Georgia tried to back out the crate but looking down saw to her amazement fingers missing and replaced by similar cloven hooves of the nanny goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;MELODY!&quot; she screamed as the word trailed off to sound like a goat's bleat.<br />
<br />
A shiver and shudder ran down her slender form as jacket and dress tightened. Breathing heavy she felt the change and Medallion's curse work it's way in, over, around, and through.<br />
<br />
It was as the Longshoremen popped the door to the freight compartment they heard what at first sounded of a human scream filled with pain. Then as they jumped up into the compartment one of the men saw the crate door open. Quickly he slapped the door shut but was unable to latch it tight due to shreds of a light blue dress were stuck to the door sash.<br />
<br />
Removing the torn items he latched the crate's door and peered inside. Dark and dank of light he watched as sweat ran down his face. Inside was what looked to anyone looking inside the final changes happening of a human leg becoming a hind leg of a goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's cookin' A.J.?&quot; called one of the men still working to unload baggage from the plane.<br />
<br />
A.J. turned to look back at his friend saying, &quot;Don't ask, just do your work and ask nothing of nobody!&quot;<br />
<br />
The professor and students were making a quick trip through Customs as the Baggage handler stepped up to the Customs agent. He whispered something to the man and then stood to one side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me Professor Simmons but we have a little problem! I show here on the manifest one horse crated and one rare Mountain goat crated. Yet I'm told you have three goats crated! Please explain the error?&quot; asked the Customs Agent.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know officer but when the Customs Agent in Brazil looked into that dark lighted crate if one or two of the beasties were laying down he might have thought they were a pile of straw? Besides I payed for the shipment according to their weights and their recordings. I realize that the animals must be quarantined for six weeks till all chance of infection is check by your Customs office. I believe there is nothing extra needed to be declared is there?&quot; said the Professor.<br />
<br />
The Customs Agent turned to the Baggage handler and told him to unload the crates as usual. The Professor sighed as did Frank both looking at the other and motioning three as per the report on the goats.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile A.J. was writing down the address to where they crates were to go and stuck the paper in his pocket.<br />
<br />
At last all people left were loaded on the big bus for the two hour ride back to campus. The professor slid down in his seat and began to nap. The other students buzzed yet about their personal thrills and what they hoped the Professor would let them all feel and enjoy again.<br />
<br />
Frank looked out his window as the baggage tractor and flatbeds worked their way through the parking lot to the holding pens and for some a new life to live.</p>
