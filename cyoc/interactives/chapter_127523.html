<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The week proved to be difficult for Katie and her friends. Katie and Kellie weren&#39;t om speaking terms and stayed away from eachother whenever they could. The girls tried to find out what happened but neither girl said much. Things remained awkward for everyone throughout the week. Either Katie or Kellie would often times sit alone at lunch away from everyone, leaving them open to whispers and taunts fron Ashley and Jennifer. By the end of school on Friday none of the girls seemed to be any closer ro getting Katie or Kellie to patch things up.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie&#39;s home lives weren&#39;t any easier than school. Lee, Maggie and Lisa noticed the girls seemed to be staying away from eachother. When they tried to ask what was wrong neither girl would answer. The three adults tried a desperate measure by having a sit diwn with the girls and asking them directly. Unfortunately it proved disasterous as both girls remained tight lipped and silent. <br />
<br />
Lee and Maggie were begining to worry about Kellie. The two girls had been inseperable since grade school, whatever was going they feared it could destroy their friendship. In a last ditch effort Lisa came up with an idea. She asked that Lee and Maggie take Kellie away for the weekend while she worked on Katie. If her idea worked hopefully the girls would make up.<br />
<br />
Lisa sat in the kitchen waiting for Katie to come home from school. Throughout the week Katie&#39;s routine had remained the same. She would come home, do her homework, eat dinner, then go to her room. Lisa had decided to listen at the door after the second day only to hear Katie cry herself to sleep. Lisa finally came up with an idea and now waited for Katie to return.<br />
<br />
As Katie entered the house Lisa greeted her with a smile. &quot;Hey kid how was school,&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shrugged sadly as she stared at the floor. &quot;Okay I guess,&quot; she mumbled. Lisa frowned slightly as she looked at her niece, she now prayed this wild idea would work.<br />
<br />
Dinner passed as it had all week. Katie ate in silence before excusing herself and doing the dishes. As she had done so all week Katie removed her ring. Lisa saw this and made her move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Katie,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I know you&#39;ve had a eough week and dont want to talk but I was wondeeing something.&quot; Katie paused as she turned to face her aunt.  &quot;Whats on your mind mom?&quot; She said sadly. Lisa now stood next to Katie and smiled. &quot;Well I was hoping you would be interested in sitting down with me tonight to watch some movies,&quot; she said. &quot;Kind of a girls night. Just you and me in our p.j&#39;s. Doing girl stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie cocked her head slightly giving Lisa a grumpy look. &quot;Like a sleepover,&quot; she said flatly. Lisa nodded excitedly causing Katie to sigh. &quot;I don&#39;t know mom I&#39;m kinda tired, its been a long week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty please,&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smirked for the first time all week. It was harf to refuse Lisa when she gave a puppy dog pout. &quot;Okay fine,&quot; she sighed as she picked up the ring. &quot;Let me get changed and we can watch some movies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa lept for joy as she watched Katie head upstairs. Once Katie was out of sight she looked at the ring in her hand.  She had palmed the ring while Katie was doing dishes and replaced it with a fake. Smiling she placed it on her finger happy her wild days finally came in handy and hopeful Katie wouldn&#39;t notice the ring was a fake.<br />
<br />
An hour later Katie and Lisa were now dressed in t-shirts and sleep pants. Mom and daughter now made their way into the living room, dragging a large blanket with them. &quot;So what movies did you get mom,&quot; Katie asked. Lisa smiled as she pointed at the blu ray player. &quot;I got something for you and me,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Why dont you go check them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curious Katie made her way towards the blu rays disks. As she looked them over a curiouslook came over herself. &quot;The Little Mermaid and Frozen,&quot; she questioned. &quot;Aren&#39;t we a little old for these.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for much longer,&quot;Lisa smiled. Before Katie could say anything she felt a small chill wash over her body. &quot;Mom what did you do,&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Lisa giggled as she got off the couch. &quot;Why don&#39;t you see for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie quickly ran towards the mirror in the hallway, noticing her clothes seemed to be slightly roomier on her. As she gazed in the mirror a look of shock came to her face. <br />
<br />
Katie wasn&#39;t 16 anymore, in fact she looked closer to 15 now. As she ran her hands over her body Katie could feel that her breasts had shrunk slightly while her waist had thinned. As she continued to stare she saw the girl become 14. Katies jaw dropped as she saw herself shrink ever so slightly. Her face becoming more childish by the moment. &quot;Why,&quot; she gasped. Katie now turned to say something to her aunt only to gasp in shock at what she saw.<br />
<br />
Lisa was no longer 35. The woman standing in front of Katie appeared to be in her mid 20s now. Lisa&#39;s youthful face and hair seemed to glow, her maturity slowly vanishing. &quot;Remember when you sent me to my room to relax after my last time uswing the ring. &quot; Katie nodded as she watched Lisa become 24. &quot;Well amazingly it worked,&quot; Lisa smiled. &quot;So tonight you and me are having a sleepover like to normal kids. Dont be mad and dont be worried. Ive been thinking about how you made your wishes and came up with an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you wish for,&quot; Katie whispered, noticing her voice rise an octave. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wished that tonight you and me would be physically 10 years old and that when the sun came up we would return to normal,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I also added that everyone would remember us at 35 and 16 so no worries about reality chamging.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie gawked at her 22 year old aunt as she became 13. &quot;This is crazy,&quot; Katie groaned. &quot;I mean how did you get the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa blushed slightly before answering. &quot;I wasnt exactly the most well behaved teen,&quot; she smirked. &quot;But thats another story for later. Now come on lets get some popcorn and srimks whilw were still tall wnough to reach the top shelves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie grinned broadly as she followed her aunt. Lisa in turn smiled, hoping that this would fimally get Katie out of her funk and find out what happened.</p>
