<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...Girl's school uniform. It was the perfect way to get back at him. Deanna stepped out of the dressing room and said &quot;Go ahead and go into the fitting room. I'll be right back with something for you to try on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't I get to see it first?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want it to be a surprise. You knew that I don't like to wear dresses. Though I'll admit that I like the dress. I'm going to see if I can get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to dare me to wear a dress are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to be a school uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you worried about? It's only clothes right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose so. Alright I'll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark walked into the fitting room while Deanna went to find the perfect school uniform for him. While she was looking the part of her that knew that she had been male gave a little twinge and she thought 'That's weird. How come I think I was a boy before? I've always been a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly in front of Deanna her old self appeared and said &quot;You haven't always been a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Deanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm you as you were. The clothing in this shop is indeed magic. Mark dared us to try on that dress. We didn't notice that anything was happening to us. Now I'm the small part of our mind that still knows we were male before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can't be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can sort of prove it.&quot; With that the vision of Dean stepped up to Deanna and tried grabbing her arm. His hand went right through her like it wasn't there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok that was creepy&quot; Deanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's creepy being just a part of our mind&quot; Dean said. &quot;Though I guess we should make the best of it. We really need to get Mark back. I'm the one who suggested the girl's school uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if we could find one that will make him a little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's look.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deanna didn't know if she believed she had been a boy or not but she was willing to consider it. As she was looking for a girl's school uniform for Mark Dean told her about their life before. It took a few minutes but she found one and took it back to Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mark I have the uniform for you to try on&quot; Deanna said as she approached the fitting room.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about time&quot; Mark said sticking his head out. &quot;What took you so long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn't find the right one for you at first&quot; Deanna said. &quot;Here it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've got to be kidding me!&quot; Mark said. &quot;This school uniform is for a little girl. I'll never fit into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We barely fit into the dress you picked out for us&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try to fit into it Mark&quot; Deanna said. &quot;The clothes are suppose to be magic, they may stretch to fit. It wouldn't hurt to try to get them on. Or are you scared?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no!&quot; Mark said. &quot;I'm not scared. Give me that uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deanna handed Mark the uniform and he ducked his head back into the fitting room. After a few moments Deanna asked &quot;Are you done yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on!&quot; Mark said. &quot;This uniform is tight on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hurry it up&quot; Deanna said. &quot;Mom doesn't want to stay here all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually she had stayed home while we came here today&quot; Dean said. &quot;Of course that was when we were an eighteen year old guy. Now that we're a fourteen year old girl Mom brought us and we met Mark here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I'm ready&quot; Mark said. &quot;I'm coming out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark came out wearing a white blouse, blue jumper, and black Mary Janes. He looked absolutely hilarious in the uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look as funny as we did when we put on that dress&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How ridiculous do I look?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look really ridiculous&quot; Deanna said. Mark didn't seem to hear Dean. Though if he was just a part of her mind then nobody would see or hear him except her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm surprised that I fit into this&quot; Mark said. &quot;I'm going to take it off.&quot; He stepped back into the fitting room.<br />
<br />
As soon as Mark was in the fitting room Deanna's mom came up to her and said &quot;I wasn't able to find a school uniform for you Dee. We'll just have to go elsewhere to find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deanna didn't know it but her mental changes had already taken place once Mark was back inside the fitting room. Mark was now Marcia and Deanna's eight year old sister. Deanna now also liked wearing dresses. &quot;Can I get this dress Mom?&quot; Deanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you can&quot; Deanna's mom said. &quot;Did the uniform fit your sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it did&quot; Deanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just barely&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the fitting room...<br />
<br />
Mark couldn't believe that he had put on this little girl's school uniform and left the fitting room. It was embarrassing enough that Deanna had seen him in it. He hoped that no one else had seen him. He was about to take off the uniform when he looked in the mirror. It seemed to hold him mesmerized.<br />
<br />
Mark's body had started changing as soon as he put on the uniform with all his body and facial hair receding into his body. Now his body started changing faster. His whole body slimmed a little bit while his Adam's Apple disappeared. His hair grew down to just past his shoulders. His face became that of a little girl. His dick shrank into a clit while his balls pulled into his body and his ball sack formed labia. His balls became ovaries while a vagina and womb formed. His new genitals moved to between his legs. As all this was happening he was shrinking. He went from five foot nine to four foot one. He now had the body of an eight year old girl.<br />
<br />
Mark's mental changes took place next. Deanna was no longer his friend but now his older sister and he was eight year old Marcia. Her mommy had brought her and Deanna here to get school uniforms for school this year. The schools had decided to go to a school uniform because of all the school shootings that had happened around the country. Like Deanna a small part of her mind continued to know that she had been a guy before but she wasn't consciously aware of it.<br />
<br />
Marcia looked away from the mirror and took off the uniform. She then put her pink dress and Barbie sandals.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Deanna and her mom stood outside the fitting room waiting for her sister. When Marcia came out their mom said &quot;Let's go get these clothes paid for and move on to the next shop. After that we'll go to Subway and get some lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deanna and Marcia followed their mom to the checkout and then out to their car.</p>
