A few hours earlier…<br />
<br />
Melissa Stovall was pleasantly surprised when Martin came home early. Even more surprising, he was in  a particularly good mood, despite the recent troubles in town. Jeremy Bower running amok, those US Marshals giving the police a hard time, and their own martial struggles. Not to mention their daughter’s own infidelities. <br />
<br />
“Good day?” Melissa asked. She was standing in the kitchen preparing dinner. Upstairs, Julie was trying to keep herself busy without breaking the terms of her grounding. The talk she and her mother had earlier left her in a much better mood. <br />
<br />
“Better than I thought. And you?” Martin asked.<br />
<br />
“Productive.” Melissa then recounted her day, and the events with Julie. <br />
<br />
While Martin was a little upset over the awkward morning his wife and daughter had, he was more happy to hear the two had since worked through their differences. The last thing he wanted was for them to have a falling out like he and Melissa had. <br />
<br />
“God what a mess this is turning into.” Martin said.<br />
<br />
“I agree. But we can worry about that later. Dinner’s ready, go call Julie down.” Melissa said, pulling the roast from the oven. Martin went to the staircase and called Julie down. She flew down the stairs and joined her parents. <br />
<br />
“Anything interesting happen at work today Dad?” Julie asked, passing around the bowl of mixed vegetables. <br />
<br />
“Not really. Mostly just finishing some of the paperwork regarding the feds.” Martin said.<br />
<br />
“Is it finally over?” Melissa asked. <br />
<br />
“I’d say so. That Bower guy is gone, and everyone is safe. There was a bit of a skirmish with one agent, but his superior assured me he’d take care of the matter. And I suspect he really will.” Martin said, thinking back to the conversation he and Agent Johnson had regarding Agent Walker’s little “outburst” at the hospital. <br />
<br />
“Can I ask what happened? There are a lot of different stories floating around school.” Julie said. <br />
<br />
“They’re probably not too far off. But I’d rather keep you out of it. Knowing won’t make life easier. And not knowing is sometimes a blessing in disguise.” Melissa said, glancing at Martin. He nodded, knowing that if Julie found out that Eric went tearing off after Spencer Lawson, she’d probably be reduced to tears, or worse. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it. The problem’s over, and I won’t be gong out of town for a long time.” Martin said. <br />
<br />
“But you will eventually.” Julie muttered, pushing a piece of carrot around her plate a few dozen times before eating it. .<br />
<br />
“Well, yes. That’s part of the job. But in the coming weeks, the only reason I’ll be going out of town is for Christmas.” Martin said. <br />
<br />
Julie looked up, her eyes finding her father smiling knowingly at her. She loved going down to her grandparents’ house for the holidays. She wasn’t a fan of white Christmases. Julie preferred the kind where you could lie on the beach.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Stovalls spent the rest of their meal discussing the impending trip to visit Martin’s relatives. Melissa was an only child, and her parents, being normal, died a long time ago. She looked like she was in her thirties, but was actually twice that in reality. <br />
<br />
She never could convince them to make the change like she had. They accepted her decision, but wanted to grow old together and die as they were born. And they did. Her mother died first, then her father. And while she loved Martin’s family, she wished her own parents could be with her. And that Julie had had the opportunity to meet them. <br />
<br />
“Are you alright Melissa?” Martin asked as they two started to clear the table. Julie went upstairs to shower and get ready for bed. <br />
<br />
“Just thinking about things, that’s all.” Melissa said. She started to wash the dirty dishes, while Martin dried them. <br />
<br />
“Do you really think Julie’s, uh, problem is medical?” Martin asked, not sure how to phrase if any other way. He’d been thinking about that for a long time now, but didn’t dare say something in front of Julie. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t hurt to check. But even if this pans out, it doesn’t excuse her behavior towards Eric.” Melissa said, fiercely scrubbing a plate as her mind recalled the things she’d overheard Julie’s friends say about her daughter’s relationship. <br />
<br />
“I agree. But if it turns out that nothing is wrong, from a medical stand point, what do you want to do?” <br />
<br />
“I don’t know. We’re taking small steps froward, but Julie isn’t really going anywhere. I wonder if we should take her to see a therapist.”<br />
<br />
“The only therapist in town who treats teenagers and youth is Francis Twist. And considering her close friendship with the Andersons, I don’t think that would be beneficial.” Martin pointed out. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t necessarily have to be in Moon Lake Martin.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” <br />
<br />
Even though Martin had recently spent days away from home, sometimes Melissa wondered if he forgot that there was an entire world outside the town. Moon Lake seemed to exist in another dimension. <br />
<br />
“Have you ever given any thought to moving Martin?” Melissa asked. She had a feeling she knew what her husband’s answer would be. <br />
<br />
“Not really. Why? Do you want to go? I won’t stop you if that’s really what you want to do.” Martin said. He didn’t want Melissa to leave, but he certainly wouldn’t do anything to stop her. That wasn’t the way to get back in her good graces. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know. But I’ve been thinking a lot lately, not just about us. About living in the real world. I get why there are these ‘were towns’ but it’s rather like living on a reserve. Only more cut off from the rest of the country.”<br />
<br />
“I guess.” Martin said, having never really thought about it until now. Melissa was the one who came into this life, Martin had been born into it. And while he was perfectly happy to be a were, he did wonder what growing up normal would have been like. <br />
<br />
“I’m not saying I want to move, it’s just something I’ve been thinking about. A change of scenery might be a good thing.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe. But I’ve spent my entire life surrounded by were. Living with normal people, I’m not sure I could do it. And then, what would I do for a living? Local politics around here is completely different from that in other cities.”<br />
<br />
“Roosevelt became president.” Melissa said. Martin internally sighed. Whenever he got depressed or disenchanted with being a politician, Melissa would pull out the “Roosevelt was the first, and thus far only, were president”. **<br />
<br />
“But that was during a different time. And he’s had to live the rest of his life in seclusion, so no one recognizes him.” Martin said. <br />
<br />
Melissa just shrugged. She went back to washing dishes. Martin slipped away to his study. He turned on his computer, and began scrolling through his emails. Most of it was either spam, or related to work. But one email was from a friend.<br />
<br />
And the term “friend” is used loosely. Martin hesitated to open it, fearing what might be waiting for him. The email was from one of his past lovers. A girl he’d met a long time ago, before Julie was born. Why was she suddenly contacting him?<br />
<br />
Check to make sure Melissa was still busy in the kitchen, Martin took a deep breath and opened the email. <br />
<br />
“Hey Marty! It’s been a while hasn’t it? Anyway, the reason I’m contacting you after all this time is because I’m coming up from San Diego for a few days, and thought we could get together. Catch up, maybe spend some more quality time together?<br />
<br />
Give me a call, my number’s the same. Lots of love, Alyssa”<br />
<br />
There was a deep pit growing in Martin’s gut. Alyssa was a legal representative for the company Moon Lake often hired to do construction jobs. Which was how they first met, Martin went to San Diego to discuss the deal with Masterwork Construction Inc. <br />
<br />
“Oh god what if Melissa finds out? What if Alyssa shows up at the house looking for me?” Martin thought, almost hysterical. <br />
<br />
“Martin, you’ve got a call from your secretary! Do you want to take it in there?” Melissa called.<br />
<br />
“Uh, no. I’ll come out there.” Martin called back. He hadn’t even heard the phone ring. He walked into the kitchen, trying not to let his beak expression show. He took the phone from Melissa, and inhaled. <br />
<br />
“Tell me you’ve got some good news for me Janet.” he said. <br />
<br />
“Uh, I’m not sure at the moment. Is there somewhere we can talk more privately? I suspect your wife can hear, and this is rather sensitive.” Janet said. Martin exchanged a look with Melissa before slipping into another room.</p>
