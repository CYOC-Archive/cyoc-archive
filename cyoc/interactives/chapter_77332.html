<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack's form towered over the &quot;little&quot; bears at the bottom floor, his 25 feet in height dwarfing their heights of 9-11 feet tall. Jack could feel power coursing through his entire body as he felt the muscle settle in, his new massive collar giving him the freedom to feel every muscle fiber's power collect within him. He could dominate anyone he so desired if he could, this he knew. But he had no desire to dominate anyone. His only reason for living was to serve his master, who'd saved him from his lonely and pathetic life to give him power and love beyond his wildest dreams.<br />
<br />
 Jack's eyes didn't look away from Dan on the second floor as he smiled face to face with him, their heights equal thanks to the second floor of which Dan was standing upon. It was a feeling unlike any other for Jack, clearly shown by his soft but leaking cock; an enormous pool of cum forming at his enormous feet and wetting his enormous balls. He was a marvel even to Dan, who'd thought he'd seen amazing sights of all kinds. Jack's full lips moved to form words that Dan was almost unprepared for. &quot; What do you wish, Master?&quot; Jack asked with his booming voice as his blue eyes shone in the light of the ceiling windows. Dan almost lost his words as he felt the power to control this giant fully set in. &quot; Take me home, pup!&quot; he called to Jack's ears.<br />
<br />
 &quot;YES MASTER!&quot; he roared happily as he fully stood up and reached his hand out to grab Dan. His enormous hand wrapped around Dan's cub like form and raised him single handedly. Dan looked around excitedly, having never been picked up so easily before; like a doll on a shelf. Dan's cock was waving with its force against the firm and enormous hand of Jack before he was set down on his hulking shoulder like a parrot.<br />
<br />
 Jack then proceeded to turn and face the other end of the hall, beginning his walk to the end. People backed away, assuming their show had ended and their new king-sized redhead needed room to leave the mall. Jack's foot steps shook the building almost at a high enough level to be put on a Richter scale his mass was beyond comprehension as he had long since entered the tons and, as a red head, could except a lot more growth to come if someone could find him some weights big enough! <br />
<br />
 Jack was nearing the end of the hallway, glad that the mall had a large door way made for red heads. Jack, however, had not taken his added body mass into account as he came up to a door that stopped at his crotch in height, no more than 10 feet apart. He looked to his master urgently, tears flowing from his big blue eyes. &quot; I'm sorry, Master!&quot; he roared, making several windows shatter from his sad cry. &quot; I can't follow your wish with this door in the way!&quot; he said as he got down on his hands and knees, feeling defeated. Many of the other bears were too afraid to pass the door in fear of being struck by the rampaging but depressed giant. Dan's dominant side was extremely turned on by the force of which such a massive creature felt implied to apologize to him. Jack was such a frail creature and yet he was the most powerful one in the room physically. Dan still intended to be his master but he couldn't help but protect Jack from things like this. His cock tore at his jockstrap and shorts as an idea struck. &quot; Jacky, its time to feed you, now&quot; he said as he stood up and began to unzip his tight shorts and jock. Jack's eyes lit up at the command to take in his master's magnificence a second time. He extended his hand, allowing Dan to crawl onto it, and balanced him in front of his face, an eager expression filling Dan's vision. &quot; Take&quot; was all Dan said, Jack reacting quickly to the command and grasping Dan's cock with his powerful, full lips. Dan instantly shook with pleasure as he felt the large lips move against his cock and the large jaw and tongue move around his dick like a perfect vacuum. <br />
<br />
 Jack's thoughts were filled with happiness as he reveled in servicing his Master's 13 inch cock, feeling it quiver as he felt Dan reach climax. &quot; Oh god!&quot; Dan screamed as he felt his balls contract and his cock tighten before firing a volley of cum down the giant's gullet. The giant took to the taste like milk as he accepted load after load after load, a warmth filling his body as the orgasm progressed. It felt like hours for Dan to finally finish although it actually only took an astounding 2 minutes. Jack licked around Dan's cock and then licked again in assurance that he'd cleared the cock of anything left. He pulled regrettably from Dan and stood to his full height before filling it get extremely hot. Warmth was quick to race through Jack's body as he felt veins criss cross through his skin and empower his muscles.<br />
<br />
 The earth shook mightily as the coming of Jack's growth was near. At first, it seemed only slight but then it began to increase in intensity as Jack jumped a foot in height, equaling many of the heights of non red headed bears on the top floor and then passing that as his head began to soar above the shrinking bears around him. Those with large stomachs began to look less large to Jack as his gut reached out further forward as Jack went higher and higher, rocketing towards the sealing. Suddenly, at 30 feet in height, he'd towered over the red heads on the 2nd floor and only raced higher to the third. Dan was having trouble standing as he felt the muscles and skin thicken in the palm underneath him. He hadn't anticipated his cum would give this much power to a man but he was glad he'd given it to Jack and not an undeserving man. The giant beast before him grew taller and taller but also grew wider and wider. Jack's chest pushed out further into Dan along with his enormous gut that made it difficult to see below and it only became harder as the beast got beastlier. <br />
<br />
 The enormous cock that dwarfed Dan grew to the point where it became questionable a red head of the highest caliber could lift it. It's enormous angry head grew heavier on Jack's other shoulder although the muscle beneath seemed to match its growth well. The muscles of the giant Jack grew more and more impressive as they appeared to harden around Dan. It was like a map of the world that only continued to grow more diverse and striated. The building was beginning to have trouble handling the bear as he began to press into the floors and close in on the ceiling. It was becoming harder for the other bears to give Jack room, forcing them to run to the other side of the mall in hopes of protecting themselves from the debris that was beginning to fall from above their heads. <br />
<br />
 Jack's ascent to more power only became harder for those below as he finally broke 50 feet, his head hitting the plexi glass with a powerful thud. The pressure of his growth intensified as it was obstructed by the force of the extra hardened glass in its attempt to perform its job. Jack's pre rained down on the little bears, the ecstasy of growing becoming more than Jack could contain. His new enlarged, house sided balls, which were pressing harder into the ground as Jack had less room to stand straight in his growth, bathed in a pool of cum that was becoming more like a lake to those at the bottom floor. <br />
<br />
 Suddenly, the floors above began to collapse as Jack's massive arm accidentally smashed into the weakening 3rd floor, collapsing into the 2nd floor and then to the bottom. Dan lay in amazement as he watched the destruction his powerful bear was creating in worship of him. It was the biggest turn on Dan had yet to experience and it only went deeper and deeper into his collection of ecstasy as his pup grew bigger and bigger, putting pressure into the mall as it struggled to contain its new increasing contents. A scream could be heard from the buildings walls as the giant's back pressed into the ceiling, attempting to adjust his body to the height of the ceiling and protect his master from harm. Jack's attempt to direct his body downward only made his perfect gut push against the ground dutifully; along with his cock of which was now big enough for several 12 foot red heads to live in. &quot; MAAAASTEEEEEERR!!!&quot; bellowed the giant Jack as felt the strength he'd been given climax to an earth shaking over drive. It felt as though the power of such an earth quaking growth could be registered on the Richter scale on a magnitude of 7.0. The ceiling burst into a shower of glass as the giant's body grew up and out of the building like a rocket, his massive legs filling the building before even the monstrous thighs of the beast outgrew it and his calves began to reek havoc in assisting the ocean of pre that now filling the first floor and pushed off to the second floor, the bears inside fighting for their lives. <br />
<br />
 Jack's body exited the ceiling like a majestic creature though his large features continued to soar higher and higher. Dan's tiny form still lay on the palm of such a beautiful giant, his cock firing off in his jockstrap like a machine gun with infinite ammo. It almost seemed like Jack would never stop growing until finally the growth slowed down as Jack's calves could be seen half way outside the mall and then stop as his balls balanced themselves at top the structure, making it strain as they continued to produce more cum and enlarge. Jack roared as he body came to an abrupt stop and ended its grown at an enormous 356 feet tall at a width of 340 feet wide and just as thick. <br />
<br />
 Jack stuck out his neck and moved aside his hardening cock as he tried to get a glimpse of his master on his hand, his big blue eyes and large smile looking down over the enormous pecs and hulking gut. &quot; DID I DO OK, MASTER!&quot; his huge voice making the earth quake at a constant 3.0. Dan's mouth was agape as he looked up at his blindingly handsome pup. What kind of beautiful monster had he created?!</p>
