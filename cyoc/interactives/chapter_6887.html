<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty felt bad for the guy. Sure he had been a jerk in the past, but Ty knew he couldn't just leave him this way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Rob, I'll let you get back to normal, but you're gonna have to earn it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;whatever i need to do!&quot; Robbie cried out. &quot;Ok, here's the thing- I want you to do something... something that will make you work a bit... howabout this: With every 30 push ups you do, I'll give you a inch back and 10 more pounds- &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ok ok! I'll do them!&quot; Robbie exclaimed, and right there in the men’s locker room Rob went down to the floor and began doing his push ups- fumbling with his oversized clothes, and ridiculously large tank top.<br />
<br />
&quot;ten...eleven...twelve...thirteen...fourteeeeen...fifteeeeen....sixteeeeen... ok robbie you can do it, only a ten more now.... twenty-onnnnne...twenty-twoooo&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob was shaking, he couldn't finish the set, he knew it and ty knew it. He would be unable to get to thirty, unless something happened. 'This is pathetic', Ty thought to himself, 'the poor guy cant even do thirty. I'll give him a little energy boost', thought Ty<br />
<br />
&quot;good! twenty-eiiiight, twenty-niiiine....Thirty!&quot; Finally, Ty thought.<br />
<br />
Robbie collapsed onto the cold wet cement, gasping for air, exhausted by the exercise on his small frame. <br />
<br />
&quot;ok then Robbie, here’s your inch, and pounds...&quot; Robbie felt a warm calming sensation overtake him while he lay there, panting on the locker room floor. He could feel his body stretch slightly, his feet were pushing a little farther, and his bony body was putting on a little meat now, he didn’t feel so exhausted as he did before...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats better isn't it now?&quot; Ty said calmly.<br />
<br />
 Rob was able to move, though he was still tired and out of breath from the exercise. He crawled up from the cement floor and stood up, a slight bit disoriented. &quot;It worked! I'm taller! I'm... oh thank you Ty, thank you so much!&quot; he exclaimed... <br />
<br />
Once again Robbie, tired and already sweaty Robbie was back onto the cement floor, ready to do a second set of push ups. <br />
<br />
&quot;ten...eleven...twelve...&quot; Ty noticed this work out was already a little easier for him, though it was still, he could tell, a lot of exercise for the little guy. <br />
<br />
&quot;good! twenty-two... twenty-three...&quot; Rob was at that point now where it looked like he would need to get another little boost from Ty, but right when it looked as if he would stop, Rob kept going, and proved to ty that he was going to finish the set... alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;thats great!&quot; Ty exclaimed, almost proud of the work rob had done. There Rob was again, in the same position and everything, laying down on the cement, his face laying to the left, leaving his whole right side of his face touching the cool cement surface. That cool sensation was replace soon after, by warmth, a calming warmth that made him grow... slightly<br />
<br />
Robbie got up again, now obviously taller, and obviously more muscular. Though still skinny, and rather short, Rob's body was quickly returning to its regular appearance. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do it again Ty!&quot; Rob said with high enthusiasm. He was still breathing heavy, but was already feeling strong and full of energy. <br />
<br />
Again Ty stood over the poor guy, doing his thirty push ups, though growing stronger with each set, this was still a hell of a lot a work. Ty could tell from the redness in his face that this wasn't any walk in the park. Rob wanted his size back, desperately. <br />
<br />
&quot;you're doing great Robbie!&quot; Ty exclaimed, while watching him do his twenty-third push up. This time when Rob finished he stood up, exhausted, but enthusiastic. Out of breath, and red in the face, Rob watched his body expand with 10 more pounds and he felt himself grow. <br />
<br />
Those loose clothes hung loosely, but he could now wear them without the fear of them falling off. <br />
<br />
Ok ok! Ty, i think i can do another set... it feels easier each time...&quot; he said, calmly. <br />
<br />
Once more Ty found Robbie on the floor doing yet another set of push ups. 'this is unbelievable', thought Ty 'he's already done 90 push ups!' Not only that, but he was doing them more rapidly than before, a much quicker pace, and less exhausted each time.<br />
<br />
&quot;thirty! again, this is quite impressive Robbie!&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;thanks&quot; Robbie replied. Standing up for a second, Rob felt that warm, almost relaxing sensation overtake his frame. he could feel it grow, slightly taller now, and he felt his pecs push out slightly, filling his tank top with more muscle. His arms now fairly well defined and at a respectable size. He was quickly returning to normal... his body looked like it had before, though slightly shorter, and a little smaller, he looked much like before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then!&quot; and with that, Ty saw Robbie doing his fifth set. Rob was doing them with unrestrained gusto, showing off his newly formed triceps, and proving to Ty that he really deserved his body back. Ty didn’t even need to count out loud, it would have been meaningless. Before long at all Rob was standing straight up, looking at Ty, and showing that he was only slightly out of breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Robbie&quot; You did it, I'll give you the last 10 pounds and inch, ok?<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, thanks-  thanks so much ty, im soo-&quot; And his words cut off, Rob felt the growth hit him- he was now taller, his biceps expanding outward again, his pecs swelling out with more muscle- causing the fabric of his tank top to tighten, and his shoulders widening. No longer were the clothes to big, but just right. Rob was back to normal... for the moment anyway...</p>
