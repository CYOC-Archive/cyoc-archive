<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colin pulled up the gravel road to the small grey house, Tina fidgeting nervously in the passenger’s seat. <br />
“Relax Tina, I’m just dropping you off and going straight back home.” Colin smiled.<br />
“It’s not you I’m concerned about…” Tina said as she looked in the back row. <br />
Melanie sat there smiling dopily, her sweatshirt unable to hide that she wasn’t wearing a bra. <br />
“I’m sure nobody’s gonna notice!” Colin smiled. <br />
‘Nobody’s gonna notice? You sexy moron…’ Tina thought with a deflated frown. <br />
‘Okay, calm down, nobody noticed anything different about Lisa, what’s a few extra cup sizes gonna do?’ Colin thought nervously as he got out to get Tina’s door. <br />
<br />
The front door swung wide open as someone stepped outside. <br />
“Oh, hello Winona.” Tina waved.<br />
“Yeah, hi there… Winona?” Colin said as his eyes went wide.<br />
Eyes that shimmered like gleaming sapphires met his, an Icelandic braid of hair as dark as midnight fluttered in the breeze, long icy pale legs adorned with fishnets and tall black boots carried her in a lanky yet confident manner as she stood before them.<br />
“Uh hey, you, me, car, back…” Colin uttered as he blushed.<br />
“Melanie’s here.” Lucy said as the girl in the big sweatshirt jumped out. <br />
“Hey Winonaaaaa!!!” Melanie called out as she ran up and hugged her. <br />
“Hey Mel, good to see you!” Winona smiled. “What took so long?” <br />
“Oh, the meeting was a lot… longer than I thought.” Melanie said as she gave Colin a coy grin. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, so I need a shower and my clothes washed NOW.” Tina said as she stepped into the light to reveal the dried red splotches all over her khaki pants and dress shirt. <br />
“What happened?” Colin asked. <br />
“While you were helping out with Christy’s club, Wendy and I were helping out the warehouse and Olivia saw Trent’s shirt get wet while she was unloading some pizza sauce… you can guess where it went from there.” Tina sighed.<br />
“Yeah, I’m gonna be heading back to my place now, see you tomorrow!” Colin said as he kissed the sauced goth on the lips. <br />
“I thought you said he took a week off work?” Winona asked.<br />
“He did, but he has… stuff at his apartment to deal with…” Tina said.<br />
“Aw come on! We wanna meet him for real this time!” Winona pleaded. <br />
<br />
Colin’s phone dinged. <br />
Sam: New parts won’t be here until Wednesday… and now I’m gonna need to go find a clothing place open this late because Lucy fell into the sewer…. &#129324;&#129324;&#129324;&#129324;&#129324;&#129324; <br />
<br />
“Oh my god, is she okay?!” Colin said as he texted that very question. <br />
<br />
Sam: She’s fine, but right now I need to focus on the road, talk later bye. <br />
<br />
“Guess I don’t have plans anymore…” Colin shrugged. <br />
“Awesome! Come on, you’re just in time for game night.” Winona smiled.<br />
“Cool, what are we playing? Mario Kart? Halo? Street Fighter?” Colin asked. <br />
Winona just stood there “Uhhhh… we were thinking more like…” <br />
<br />
“Twister?” Colin asked. <br />
“Yeah, it’s my fave….” Winona smiled as she took off her boots and spread the game mat across the floor. <br />
“Only because you never lose.” A voice interjected from upstairs.<br />
Colin looked up to see a woman with a deep tan and monotone gaze. Her raven hair was full of thick natural curls, her full lips resting in a near straight line, the left half of her nose bearing two small silver rings that shone like the metal clips along her earlobes. Her oversized rock tee fluttered in the breeze, caressing her big broad hips as she descended the final step. <br />
“Colin, this is Chloe. Chloe, this is Colin.” Melanie said as she introduced her friend to “Tina’s” boyfriend. <br />
“Oh… hey!” Colin awkwardly smiled. <br />
Chloe said nothing, spinning the spinner and placing her left foot on red.<br />
“Your move.” Chloe said bluntly. <br />
<br />
“Oh? Me? Alright.” Colin said as he spun. <br />
Right hand on green. <br />
Colin bent down and set his hand on the green circle as he heard satisfied sighs from behind. <br />
“Okay, Melanie, you’re up.” Colin said. <br />
Melanie cheered and giggled with glee before her spin. <br />
Right foot red. <br />
And she picked the red circle right across from Colin’s, her ass directly facing him. <br />
‘This can’t get more awkward.’ Colin thought…. right as Winona got left hand green and got right next to him. <br />
<br />
A few spins in, it got very awkward. <br />
“Left hand blue.” Colin said as he weaved his arm between Melanie’s armpit and set his hand right below Chloe’s knee. At this point, he had his face not even an inch away from being wedged in Chloe’s butt. <br />
‘This is the most awkward thing I’ve ever done in my life.’ He thought as he sweated. <br />
Melanie spun and began pulling her leg away. <br />
“Colin, I’m done!” Tina called as she walked towards the living room. <br />
Colin immediately went into panic mode. <br />
“Ahhhhhh, SPIDER!!!!” Colin shouted as he slipped out of the heap and sent the ladies to the floor. <br />
<br />
“Heyyy Tina!” Colin smiled. <br />
The statuesque goth stood there in a black nightie, blushing and beckoning him with her finger.<br />
Colin followed her upstairs and into her bedroom. <br />
“I’ve wanted this  all day…” Tina softly smiled. <br />
Colin grinned and slipped off his shirt before yanking his pants down and hopping in. <br />
He planted kisses along her neck as he kneaded her breast and thrusted his member into her eagerly. <br />
“Hey Tina, wanna-” Winona started before going slack jawed at the sight of her roommate getting absolutely railed. <br />
“Wait, C-Colin, there’s… there’s some… someone’s in…. TURN AROUND!!!” Tina screamed. <br />
<br />
Colin fell out of bed, his hard member popping out of Tina’s pussy and standing out full mast in front of her roommate. <br />
“Oh geez, I’m so sorry, we didn’t hear you come- Ahhhhh!” Colin said as Winona got down in front of him and started sucking his soaking dong. “Hey hey what are you doing?!” <br />
<br />
Tina watched in disbelief as her childhood friend sat there giving her boyfriend a blowjob right in front of her. She was ready to scream when she watched Winona’s butt suddenly balloon out so much that her shorts got wedged between her cheeks. Her thin, almost bony thighs suddenly began to fill out as Colin squirmed on the floor. Winona’s gangly arms began to see tone and definition for the first time since… well, ever! <br />
Winona pulled her mouth away and yanked her shorts down before jamming his throbbing dong into herself as she started riding it. <br />
Colin could see that her flat stomach had suddenly sculpted itself into some noticeable abs, her breasts pumping up and pushing out until they were as big as Tina’s. Her bra snapped in two as he came, laying there breathless as Winona kissed him. <br />
<br />
“Hey girls, it’s been fifty… minutes….” Chloe said as she walked in, “What the hell?” <br />
“This isn’t what it looks like!” Tina blurted out. <br />
“Pretty sure it’s exactly what it looks like…” Chloe said with folded arms. <br />
About five minutes later Colin was flung back onto the bed as Chloe locked lips with him. She tossed her huge shirt to the side and sat right on his stiff member as she started riding it. Tina stood there speechless as Chloe made him climax in under ten minutes. <br />
“WHAT THE FUCK, YOU GUYS?!” Tina screamed. <br />
<br />
“We wanted Master inside of us as much as you did.” Winona said as she wiped her mouth.<br />
“How could you- wait, what did you just say?” Tina asked.<br />
Then she stood there as a wave of realization washed over her.<br />
“I have to tell Sam.” She said as she grabbed her phone.</p>
