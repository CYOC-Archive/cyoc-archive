<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Esmeralda and Duncan quickly got into the car, and drove away.  They drove off the main highway, and stopped the car in the parking lot of a small conversation area.  <br />
<br />
&quot;That was close,&quot; sighed Duncan, as he got out of the car.  He embraced Esmeralda, and gave out a contented howl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, I always use my powers to make sure the cops don't find us.  I did this on purpose, Dunc,&quot; said Esmeralda, tugging his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the hell did you do that?&quot; asked Duncan curious, lighting up a smoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember how the full moon was four years ago this very night.  I wanted celebrate your transform in the woods, now that your a full grown werewolf.&quot;  Esmeralda gave him a kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; growled Duncan.  &quot;Full moon isn't till Friday.&quot;  Quietly, a part of him also thought, &quot;Celebrate?  Why doesn't she turn into a wolf and see how she likes it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tampered with your calendar, full moon's tonight Dunc, she said scractching him behind the ear.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Duncan howled, and looked at the horizon.  He saw the moon rising.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, it is tonight,&quot; he growled.<br />
<br />
He tried to take off his clothes, but couldn't.  For the last couple of years he felt it was senseless to ruin his clothes everytime he transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want it to be just like old times,&quot; said Esmeralda, kissing him again.<br />
<br />
His transformations were more severe now.  No sooner had the moon risen, that he ears began to stretch out like an elastic.  He winced as he felt the fur travel up them, as they popped up on the to of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rou (Fuckin full moon, I already can't talk) rould of rarned me,&quot; he said as his tongue started to expand, and his teeth turn into proper fangs.  Those were his last words as he went to lean against his car, to take a human look at the world as long as it was possible.<br />
<br />
Now the fur came next.  The itching had turned into a burning, as his fur grew thicker and faster than they had four years ago.  He stared at his hands as their heavy coat of hair became a wolf's coat of fur.<br />
<br />
Next was his tail, he growled as he felt the familiar pain in his lowere back.  &quot;RIIPPPP&quot; as his jeans split in the back, to let out a tail, larger than ever before.<br />
<br />
The growth in size that usually preceeded the main tranformation now happened in the middle.  The couple of inches caused the semi-human Duncan reach a temporaty height of seven feet, enough to strain all the seams in his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Dunc?&quot; asked Esmeralda as she hugged him.  <br />
<br />
Duncan didn't say a word, as the fur covered him from head to toe.  He was thinking though . . . &quot;This has got to stop.  I'm not going to be Esmeralda's pet werewolf all my damn life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next were his paws.  He watched as his hairy hands develped into the huge paws of a seven foot werewolf.  For a change, his feet (which had grown over the years) were next, ripping out of his socks and shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is what my life is,&quot; thought Duncan bitterly, growling at the thought of what he was.<br />
<br />
Esmeralda, sensing something was wrong, tried to cheer up Duncan.  &quot;You know what it means when a man has big ears and big feet, Dunc,&quot; she said.  &quot;And I know its really true in your case,&quot; she added, rubbing his shoulder.<br />
<br />
A smirk, which turned into a howl, brought in the next round of Duncan's transformtion.  His arms turned into egs as they lengthened out, tearing the end of his sleeves.  His legs lengthened, and reformed so it was impossible for him to walk on them.  Then his chest barrowled out, straining his shirt.  The pain again made his thoughts of Esmeralda run cold.<br />
<br />
Duncan had nearly finished changing into the powerful, gigantic wolf that was now his true form.  His human form, even in the daytime, warped to accomadate the transformation he was undergoing.  He wolf's neck ripped his shirt, his barrel chest tore it halfdown the middle.  Unlike the first time he turned, he was unable to hold on to the car in order to remain on two feet.  He fall to the ground on all four feet.<br />
<br />
Duncan decided to get it over with.  He gave his howl, a long &quot;AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,&quot; saw the world go into black and white as his muzzle pushed out.  But this time, he thought, this would be it.  He would either turn himself in, kill Esmeralda, or turn her into a werewolf so she could suffer along him (or cure both of them).</p>
