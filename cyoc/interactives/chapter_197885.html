<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Aaaaaand we’re here!” Mike parked his truck parallel to the curb in front of a modest sized Victorian-style house. “God, it’s been way too long since I’ve seen this place! So good to be back!” The older tiger took the keys out of the ignition and hopped out of his truck in excitement, with Todd and Sam hopping out behind him. <br />
<br />
“D-Dan never told me the pack had a f-frat house…” Todd said, looking at the house in fascination as Mike led them down the small path that led to the porch. “Th-Then that m-means that the p-pack is…”<br />
<br />
“…Basically a fraternity!” Sam finished, patting his boyfriend on the back. “How awesome is that?!”<br />
<br />
“I-It’s pretty c-cool…” the wolf replied, blushing slightly as he wagged his tail. As the trio walked up into the porch, the front door opened and released the sound of club music into the night. Standing on the other side of the door was Dan, a sly grin plastered on his face. <br />
<br />
“About time you got here, cousin! The party&#39;s just getting started!” Dan held open the front door and ushered his cousin and the two tigers inside. “Welcome to ‘Casa de Wolf Pack!’” The trio was presented with a rather nice looking entryway, with an elegant double staircase leading up to the second story. In between the two staircases was a doorway that seemed to lead to a basement, judging on how the small room on the other side seemed to continue down and to the left. To their left and their right were arches that led to two different rooms: a living room and what appeared to be a dining room. Above them hung a rather elegant looking chandelier, illuminating the whole room. <br />
<br />
“God damn…this place is so fucking cool!” Sam exclaimed, looking around the room before looking over to Dan. “How the hell does your pack afford a place like this?!”<br />
<br />
“A generous donation from a CVU alumni and fellow pack member,” Dan replied. “He wanted his fellow wolves to have their own fraternity like many of the other species on campus do. If you wanted to join a fraternity, you could probably join Rho Omega Delta, Sam. They’re a feline-only frat that’s pretty big into sports. Most of the college’s star feline athletes, like my boyfriend, are members.”<br />
<br />
“B-Boyfriend?” Todd asked, his ears peeking up. “You n-never told me–”<br />
<br />
“–That he was dating someone?” Todd looked to his right and saw a lean, muscular snow leopard leaning against the wall under the arch with a smirk on his face. He proceeded to walk over to the group and wrap his arm around Dan. The wolf turned and pressed his forehead against the snow leopard’s forehead, and the two gently rubbed noses for a few seconds before looking back up at the group. <br />
<br />
“Todd, this is my boyfriend, Mark,” Dan said. “He plays left tackle on CVU’s football team.” The snow leopard extended his left hand, and Todd shook it. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet ya Todd,” Mark said. “Both Dan and your boyfriend have been telling me a whole lot about you.” Todd looked over to Sam in confusion. “You know him?” the wolf asked. <br />
<br />
Sam laughed and scratched the back of his head. “Remember when my tail first came in and I told you I threw a football with a lion, a panther, and a snow leopard?” the tiger asked. “Well it turns out that snow leopard was actually Mark. I’ve been going to the gym with him for a few days now, at least when Milo can’t go.”<br />
<br />
“Sam’s a good gym partner,” Mark said. “And with that bulky frame of his, he’s got the makings of a star quarterback if you ask me. Oh, speaking of which–” the snow leopard turned his attention to Sam, “–the football team’s holding tryouts this Friday. You should totally go. I’ve already told the coach about you, and he’s looking forward to seeing what you can do.”<br />
<br />
Mike wrapped an arm around his little brother’s shoulder and ruffled the fur on his head. “Check you out, fuzzball! A player from the football team gave the coach his personal recommendation <i>and</i> the coach is eager to see what you can do! I know you’re a shoe-in for the team!” Sam blushed and sheepishly tried to get his brother’s arm off him. “Mike, stop…you’re embarrassing me…”<br />
<br />
“Well anyways,” Dan spoke up, “you all just chill out and make yourself at home. There’s drinks and pizza in the kitchen. You guys are some of the first people here, so you get first dibs on pretty much everything. Then again, it is a weeknight, and weeknight parties never get too crazy. Guess we’ll have to make up for that on Friday night.”<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah! I like your style!” Mike high-fived Dan enthusiastically. “I was telling these two that you guys threw the <i>wildest</i> parties when I was in school just a few years ago. Gotta make sure these two go to a wild party at least once in their four years here!” <br />
<br />
“W-Wilder than the one a f-few nights ago?” Todd asked, sounding a bit concerned. While he couldn’t remember much from that party, he did remember how out of control it got. On the other hand, it did lead to a rather intimate night with Sam, which the wolf definitely didn’t oppose. <br />
<br />
“You bet it’s gonna be wilder than that, bud!” Dan exclaimed. “You’re a wolf now, so you gotta learn to party like one! Consider it a big ‘Welcome to the Pack’ party!”<br />
<br />
“B-But won’t we g-get in a lot of t-trouble for being s-so loud?” Todd asked. <br />
<br />
“The police are pretty damn chill when it comes to loud college parties,” Mark spoke up. “They tend to look the other way unless the party gets <i>waaaaaaay</i> out of control. And besides, most of the houses on this street are fraternity or sorority houses, so no one will file a noise complaint!”<br />
<br />
Todd was still feeling rather unsure about the whole thing until he felt a strong hand on his left shoulder. He looked over and saw Mike giving him a reassuring smile. “Trust me Todd, you’re not gonna regret going to that party,” the older tiger said. Another hand was placed on his right shoulder. “Come on babe, you gotta come,” Sam said. “You know I’m going, and I don’t wanna go without you.”<br />
<br />
Todd sighed and gave his boyfriend a weak smile. “O-Okay…I’ll go,” he said. He turned to his cousin and asked “What time is that party on Friday?”<br />
<br />
“Uh…we’re still working out all the details,” Dan admitted. “I’ll work on getting everything together as the week goes on. For now, just hang out and enjoy yourselves!”</p>
