<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay left the room and immediately decided to have a look around, check how Emma was doing in terms of that challenge. He never realized before that moment in there just how satisfying it was having that kind of hook up - his dick was hard again and he knew before long it&#39;d be time to take care of himself. But that needed to wait - the time was coming up, he knew, when his changes would expire and Jaya would turn back into Jay. And he couldn&#39;t well do that here, and in public.<br />
<br />
The public humiliation would be altogether too much, let alone the reveal that he could change his form.<br />
<br />
Plus, this was always going to be just temporary. Jay was honestly also looking forward to using the Chronivac on some other targets. A grin on his face as he walked through the house. It looked like Luke and Wes were in one room, totally not touching each other while they were fucking a woman from the floor. He passed another room, seeing it looked like Nolan had found another date. Good on him, the guy deserved to have some fun.<br />
<br />
And then he found Emma, and it looked like Jay had been right on the money. Luis was making out with her on the couch back there near the rooms. Luis had his shirt off, and was obviously sweating, his hard dick visible in his pants. He murmured to her, &quot;You ready for my hard gay dick...you ready for that...?&quot; Sure Luis, sure, Jay thought. <br />
<br />
He decided he&#39;d text her later and let her have some fun. Jay needed to get going.<br />
<br />
As he left the party, he hurried past the substitute door man, waving at him as he started trekking home. It wouldn&#39;t be too terribly long. It was like a five minute drive there, and a fifteen minute walk. Jay knew the time was getting closer, but he felt a lot better when he looked around and saw so few people on the road. Swaggering as he went, Jay flexed for a nearby window and watched his bicep twitch just a bit larger than it was earlier.<br />
<br />
Jay bit his lip. He knew it was gonna be hitting him hard. His dick was throbbing just at the contemplation of it. Fuck he wanted to be alone and just enjoy the sensations. As he walked home he felt the blouse he was wearing getting tighter on his delts and lats, knowing he was slightly getting bigger again.<br />
<br />
He needed to make haste.<br />
<br />
Jay was just proceeding down the road toward his house as he moaned and felt his dick get slightly longer and thicker. Fuuuck, that felt nice. By the time he reached the front door he was sweating up a storm, his face somewhat more strong featured and skin feeling tougher. Ohh yeah. He fumbled with the keys with thicker and larger hands, and then managed to get indoors. Jay stumbled around for a moment as he locked the door and took off his shoes.<br />
<br />
Hurrying into his room, Jay started to take off his clothes as they started to get tighter on him again. Blouse and skirt thrown on to the floor as he felt his delts surge again. He was getting broader, fuck, he was getting manlier again. Mmph...! Jay watched his dick thicken and strengthen in his boxers, feeling his balls grow larger... he shedded the athletic supporter and the boxers, standing there naked, watching the entirely male Jay Kallum returning.<br />
<br />
Jay tossed his head back and moaned loud and strong as his mammaries retracted and firmed up, turning from breasts into strong, hard pectoral muscles. Jay rubbed at them the entire way, feeling his sensitive tits transforming into less sensitive but still very much enjoyable pecs. Fuuuck yes! Jay groaned and then felt it start hitting him.<br />
<br />
His cock bobbed and swayed and then the emission came. Larger and stronger than it had been when he was so bodily turned feminine, it was like three strong jets of cum coated his floor in front of him! &quot;Ahhh! Ahh! Fuck! FUCK YES!&quot; Jay stood there, fully returned to his masculine form, covered in sweat and still remembering the taste of Terry and the feeling of Nolan shuddering before release...<br />
<br />
Before long Jay hopped in the shower and rinsed off all the sweat, feeling his returned body and knowing his girlfriend was still at the party enjoying herself. Just imagining her writhing under the overstimulated form of Luis was enough to make Jay grin. Yeah, he knew he was going to need to make some more changes before the night was done. He had far too many ideas going forward. He thought about everyone at that party, and how he had all their names and faces...<br />
<br />
After his shower, Jay dried off and hurried over to his Chronivac, unlocking the screen. He started looking through, and managed to find some profiles - there was Terry, big strong and macho Terry, still ready to go evidently. There was Luis, the Italian Stallion - much more flexible than he claimed he was. And there was Nolan, insecure but rippling, muscular Nolan.<br />
<br />
So many ideas...<br />
<br />
First and foremost he was going to set the societal awareness off. That should keep people from noticing that these people were different than they usually were.<br />
<br />
Well, Jay had enjoyed the changes so far, and he decided to check and see how the others might handle some changes brought on them by the Chronivac. But there were some things he was going to do...differently. He decided to start with the first guy he went with that night, Nolan. Nolan had only been on the steroids an entire year, but having seen what he was like, Jay decided to see if he could--- yes! Jay could edit the start date of Nolan&#39;s steroid use! Grinning and thinking of how ripped he&#39;d be, Jay set Nolan&#39;s start date to be five years ago as opposed to one year ago.<br />
<br />
He had no idea what effect that would have on Nolan&#39;s build, but Jay figured tomorrow he could find out.<br />
<br />
Next he decided to go with some changes on the big man himself, Terry. Jay still remembered Terry enjoying that blowjob, and a mischievous grin started to show on his face. Terry...maybe it could be good to try out some changes similar to what Jay underwent, but different. He saw there were a lot of options as far as changes, including set amounts of change a day, awareness, and other such things.<br />
<br />
Jay went ahead and started working on Terry - with this, he&#39;d become 10% more female a day...and set his awareness of the change to mostly unaware. That way the only way Terry would realize would be when it was impossible to deny. Maybe Jay was enjoying his position a little too much, as well as what the Chronivac could do...but considering there was a button to reverse all changes, he figured he could just have some fun.<br />
<br />
And hey, maybe he could even see what he was like in the future as President?<br />
<br />
Last but certainly not least was Luis. Jay was actually surprised by the size of Luis&#39; manhood. Supposedly this guy was 9.5 inches fully hard. And now that Jay had experienced what was basically man on man, he did admit the idea of fooling around with Luis didn&#39;t seem as distant as it usually did. Contemplating what to do with Luis, he decided to do something different from everyone else. He set Luis to age 1 year every day for seven days, and also made it so his libido would grow stronger every day listed.<br />
<br />
Should make for something interesting.<br />
<br />
Done stirring the pot, Jay set every one of the new transformations to start, with the duration once complete to be 2 days, or until he otherwise ends the change. He figured he was feeling tired from a night of pure enjoyment, so he decided to turn it in...and then see how everyone changed the next day!</p>
