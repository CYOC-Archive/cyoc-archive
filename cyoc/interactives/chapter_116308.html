<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they sat on the couch and watched the movie that Melissa had put in, a light comedy that served to put both at ease, both Trevor and Melissa chuckled through parts of it but between the stress of dealing with all rumors, eventually Melissa actually began to doze. She drifted off first with her head resting against Trevor&#39;s chest. It gave Trevor a strong feeling of contentment and love which resulted in him dozing off as well. His rested his head toward his shoulder and had one arm around Melissa&#39;s shoulders. As he dozed off, Trevor felt himself dream.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a nice spot,&quot; Trevor heard Melissa&#39;s voice as they looked out over the spot he&#39;d described for their first date, &quot;I&#39;m glad you showed it to me. There is peace here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor soon noted that he was in his werebull form, based on the Braunvieh breed, as he turned his head and felt his ears slowly move forward and back. He turned to see a beautiful fully transformed and mature werecow beside him. She was shorter than him, and actually well shorter, but still well muscled and as curvaceous as any werecow. He quickly noted that her form was based off a breed purely used for dairy. Werecows had the largest breasts of any of the weres in Moon Lake and the largest range in their size. All werefoxes were in the F cup range and all werecats and weretigers were in the E cup range. Werehorse mares were in the D cup range in order to maintain their athleticism to run and so on. <br />
<br />
For werecattle that range went from an H cup at the smallest to a J cup at the largest, which did often reflect why werecattle were often the most heavily muscled and that was determined based on what the breed their fursona was based on. Werecattle who were based on breeds of beef or draught were on the small end of a werecow&#39;s size range while werecows who were based on diary were on the high end of the size range while werecows who were based on breeds used for both meat and dairy were in the middle between the two extremes. The werecow beside him was in the J cup range, indicating her form was based on a breed of dairy cow. And with lighter patches around her eyes and nose and the rest of her fur being a reddish shade and relatively modest horns that curved up and forward, Trevor figured this werecow was based on the Canadienne breed. It was a breed raised in Canada while the French still had Quebec as a colony and used for dairy production. It was smaller than some other breeds in terms of overall weight, which proved beneficial on some levels regarding Canada&#39;s winters, though by the end of the 19th Century other breeds began to replace the Canadienne to the point where the Quebec government was now engaging in projects to preserve the breed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there is, Mel,&quot; Trevor said to her with a warm smile and nuzzled his nose to hers, &quot;It&#39;s why I&#39;ve liked it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Trevor... for everything,&quot; Melissa answered and brushed her red hair back with one hand to that most of its length rested behind her ears and wrapped around her modest horns, &quot;the past thirty years we&#39;ve had... they&#39;ve been magical. My dad&#39;s happy with Virginia and their John Sebastian has gotten along with our Eliza Mae...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankfully as siblings,&quot; Trevor said slowly.<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded, and gave a giggle, &quot;and even set each other up on a few dates. It&#39;s all been magical these past thirty years Trevor. I&#39;m glad to have found you... to have let you turn me... to marry you... I don&#39;t want it to ever end.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor smiled and hugged Melissa to him, &quot;Neither do I. I love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In the waking world, Harold Jenkins made his way after a lengthy day of getting the clothing he&#39;d need to fit the new him. He&#39;d gotten everything that he needed for the moment. His new wardrobe was smaller than it was before, but he now had enough that he wouldn&#39;t be having to do loads of laundry every day of the week to make sure he had clean clothes. He could save laundry day for a weekend and still have clothing left over, which was good. He&#39;d used up most of the allowance he&#39;d gotten from the college for becoming a larger were, a weretiger in his case, but he did have some left over for when Melissa joined were society. He&#39;d even gotten Melissa a bit of a gift beforehand. Given her attraction to Trevor and how close they seemed, he was fairly certain she&#39;d become a werecow at some point, meaning she&#39;d need a large robe as werecattle were also large weres and the robe would be needed for any sort of event, even at night, where she&#39;d be travelling between areas where a were could transform and areas where they couldn&#39;t. If Melissa didn&#39;t like it, a part of his mind figured it&#39;d also work for Virginia, but the first choice was for his daughter and her own future happiness.<br />
<br />
The issue that Harold ran into is that he ultimately had to go to Seattle for many of the clothes he needed to set up his new wardrobe. This took time and by the time he got back to his home, the car&#39;s dashboard clock read: &quot;8:34 PM&quot; in a neon green display. It was now dark as night was settling onto Moon Lake, and with his lengthy day, Harold really didn&#39;t have anything planned for dinner when he left Seattle. He ultimately figured just to order pizza and bite that proverbial bullet for the evening. Actually cooking something would take longer. The lateness wasn&#39;t really that much of a surprise for Harold, but the presence of a pickup truck parked on the street was. He guessed that Trevor had come over to work on homework with Melissa, but didn&#39;t think they&#39;d be still at at 8:34.<br />
<br />
He collected as many bags as he could manage for a first load from the back seat of his car and made his way toward the front door. He found the door unlocked but ultimately found no reason to fear for anything. He set his bags by the stairs and moved to the living room. He found the television on and the credits rolling for one Melissa&#39;s favorite movies. Seated on the couch and cuddled together were Trevor and Melissa. A quick sniff indicated to him that Melissa was still a Normal and he could look to see into the kitchen and saw the kitchen table where two stacks of books and papers were fairly well organized.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... homework and a movie,&quot; Harold mused to himself, &quot;and respected my note... Though they do look cute like that. But I don&#39;t think they can spend the night like that. Melissa will need dinner and I&#39;m sure Trevor&#39;s parents will want him home.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then heard Trevor actually speak in his sleep and roll to hug Melissa, &quot;I love you, Mel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is nice,&quot; Harold spoke and carefully shook Trevor&#39;s shoulder, &quot;but it&#39;s 8:34... when do your folks want you home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm?&quot; Trevor slowly blinked and came out of his sleep. When he moved, that served to actually wake Melissa up as well. She looked up to see that it was Harold waking them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tough day?&quot; Harold asked to Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;In some ways,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;but good friends helped me through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Harold gave a smile, &quot;but... Trevor... it is 8:34. If you want to stay for dinner, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m more than willing to share some pizza, but you may want to let your folks know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eight...&quot; Trevor&#39;s eyes widened slightly, &quot;Oh man... I&#39;m late.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was quickly up and moved to the kitchen where Harold heard the sounds of books being stuffed into a backpack and paper rattling with it. It ended with &quot;zzzzzzzpppuh&quot; noise as the backpack was zipped up and Trevor soon returned, though now making a bee-line for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry... I gotta go... I was expected home half an hour ago,&quot; Trevor said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t get grounded will you?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so... but you don&#39;t need to worry, nothing will stop us from having that first date tomorrow,&quot; Trevor promised, &quot;I&#39;m sure I can explain. See you tomorrow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you!&quot; Melissa smiled after him.</p>
