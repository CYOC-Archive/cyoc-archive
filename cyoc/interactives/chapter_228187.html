<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot; you sure this is where we&#39;re meeting her?&quot; Antonio whispered as they waved their way slowly through the crowd, dazzling lights and red lanterns illuminated in neon lights strung overhead as they made their way down the street<br />
&quot;These are the directions she gave me, don&#39;t know why all I know right now are my feet are killing me&quot; Kat groaned as she waddled along beside him, over the past month or so Kat had only gotten bigger, her belly growing rounder and firmer by the day, ever since the day she blew up like a balloon she had both relished and hated every moment of her new gravid form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we did tell you to stay in the penthouse and take it easy&quot; Antonio chuckled, receiving a slap to the chest from Kat<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m not gonna be one of those pregnant women who lay about all day, my business needs me, I&#39;ve worked too hard for too long to be helpless now&quot; she said with determination, only to falter as she rested her palm on her swollen bellys side<br />
&quot;Though I&#39;m afraid these little bastards won&#39;t give me much choice if I get any bigger&quot; she groaned, arching her back, pressing her cybernetic hands into the arch of her spine for support as they turned into a underpass, the sidewalk instantly bathed in shadow by the walkways above<br />
&quot;You got any idea how this happened yet?, I mean not even Mantis is this big, perfectly normal knocked up experience for her...but me?...I get turned into a human blimp&quot; she said with a sigh, Antonio smirked and leaned into her ear<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t hear you complaining when I fucked your brains out last night&quot; he said with a lustful growl, making Kats eyes close with a aroused smile and sigh<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t go starting something you can&#39;t finish babe~&quot; she purred, reaching a hand up to cup his chin, pulling him in for a deep kiss, which Antonio was more than happy to return.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Kat broke off the passionate lock of their lips, her face going serious as she looked dead ahead<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here, there she is&quot; she said, Antonios gaze snapping up as he locked onto a familiar figure leaning against a large metallic double doorway, the engraving of a dragons face on both doors, Koshi leaned right in the middle, armed crossed and head down, her metallic black kasa blocking her face from view fully, before she looked up, her eyes going wide as her eyes made contact with Kats swollen form<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; She said in a hushed voice, standing from her leaning position and rushed over to her friend, placing her hands on her swollen belly, her head darting around as if trying to take in every angle of the enormous bump<br />
&quot;Nice to see you too Koshi&quot; Kat chuckled, resting her hand at top her belly, Koshi seemed to realize her actions and removed her hands with a small bow<br />
&quot;Sorry Kat.....but....WOW, you look huge, it&#39;s only been a month!&quot; Koshi said with wonder in her voice.<br />
<br />
Kat let out a nervous chuckle as her face flushed red<br />
&quot;Yeah.....I have no idea how it happened so fast either, one minute I&#39;m fine, the next.....fucking balloon&quot; she sighed, using her hands to express her stomach ballooning outwards, Koshi continued to stare in awe before shaking her head and clearing her throat<br />
&quot;Well c&#39;mon then, let&#39;s get you off your feet, and you...the master wants a word with you&quot; she said in a low serious voice<br />
&quot;The master?, who the fuck is the master?&quot; Antonio asked as the large metallic doors swung open, the sound of heavy chains rattling as they were pulled echoed from within the building before the deep clash of echoing metal filled the room, the sound of a deep bell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, he doesn&#39;t like to be kept waiting&quot; Koshi called as she escorted them inside, helping Kat with an arm like a true blooded gentleman<br />
Antonio couldn&#39;t help but take in the room<br />
Large metallic pillars ran along either side of the room, chains running up each pillar, leading into a large golden bell, engraved and detailed with various intricate designs, with a large wooden beam aimed straight at it&#39;s metalic surface, suspended by chains, swinging and hitting the bell once again as the doors shut behind them<br />
&quot;The master is through there&quot; Koshi pointed towards the end of the room, in line with the pillars was a large archway, made of two wooden carved dragons, both their heads wrapped around eachother, looking down at the base of the door with open mouths<br />
&quot;And as for you&quot; Koshi chuckled, looking towards Kat &quot;your going to tell me all about this here&quot; she said, placing her hand firmly on her belly as they both walked away into another room, leaving Antonio alone, the only thought on his mind, was facing this mysterious &#39;master&#39; Koshi had spoken of.<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Stepping into the warmly lit room Antonio was taken a back by what he saw, on the back end of the room was what looked like a large metallic statue, made completely of gold, three arms on either side of its body, one on both sides clasped together over its chest in a prayer position, another two below it, locked over and under eachother, clasping at eachothers palms in an iron lock, the last set of arms were extended outwards and down.<br />
Around the statues neck was a set of large wooden beads on a chain, it wore some type of fabric over its shoulders, draping down onto ours crossed legs, wrapped in a metallic gold, but it&#39;s legs weren&#39;t there, or it&#39;s stomach, instead was a deep crater inside the statues body with multiple people in the center all working on something or someone on a giant vertical stand.<br />
<br />
Antonio wasn&#39;t sure who or what it was, that is until it opened it&#39;s eyes at him<br />
Before him now stood a ten foot tall mechanical monster, it&#39;s face completely Cybernetic, large and reptilian, each scale flexing and relaxing in waves across it&#39;s face, made of the same type of metal that made up Antonios arm, it&#39;s nose was flat against its face, a smooth black plate making up its shape, with two angled thin vents in either side to make up its nostrils, slightly below those were long woven golden wires making long whiskers on either side of its face.<br />
It opened it&#39;s mechanical mouth as it&#39;s piercing solid yellow eyes narrowed in on Antonio, rows of silver metallic fangs lining it&#39;s mouth, it&#39;s longest fangs at either side of the top of its mouth overlapping the bottom jaw of the creature, it&#39;s lower jaw made of the same metalic pulsing scales, with a beard at the end made of diamond shaped black carbon plates<br />
The same design for that massive mane that surrounded it&#39;s head and neck each plate pulsing in waves with the others.<br />
The creature rose from it&#39;s vertical operating table, before unfolding two more sets of hands from across it&#39;s body under its original set, each massive in size and muscle mass, all the same design as Antonios, apart from the fingers, each ending in a chrome claw, it&#39;s body was covered in a bright red sash, crossing under and over its arms to cover its chest, with a black sash across it&#39;s waist with a long Japanese style skirt that touched its ankles, it&#39;s feet also Cybernetic, massive in size, with three distinct toes in each foot, also ending in claws, and a long black cybernetic tail that dragged along the floor behind it.<br />
<br />
All in all, Antonio was terrified, he had no idea such a cybernetic monster was even possible, the mechanical giant continued to walk towards Antonio, each step sending vibrations through his feet and directly into his skull, rattling his ears as the creature drew closer, it&#39;s tail scraping across the floor as it approached.<br />
In the blink of an eye Antonio was on the defensive, his arm unfurling and extending into a long whip like form, his fingers reforming into a sharp pointed blade.<br />
<br />
[SYSTEM: KOSHI Catapult drive]<br />
[ENGAGED]<br />
[SUBSYSTEM: Sandavistan MK2]<br />
<br />
Antonio grinned as time crawled to a near stop, the creatures advances halting like it had frozen solid, effortlessly he sprinted around the towering Cybernetic creature, encircling the metal beast with his whip like arm, running back around to the front he grasped his blades hands tip in his human hand, pulling the Cybernetic string of synthetic muscle and metal taught around its legs, Looking up with a satisfied grin Antonio paused, it was almost like it was looking at him, following him move.<br />
Just as he was about to deactivate his implant his suspicions were horrifyingly answered as the mechanical monster in a flash reached out with one of its flawed hands and grasped Antonio&#39;s elongated arm firmly lifting him into the air and grasped his full arms length in multiple hands, it&#39;s head turning to look at him with a fanged smile, almost looking amused with his efforts.<br />
<br />
In a panic Antonio pressed his feet firmly into the creatures arm, retracting his arm into it&#39;s original shape, freeing himself from it&#39;s grasp, landing firmly on the floor, the creature lowered itself to Antonio&#39;s label, two sets of it&#39;s hands planting themselves on the floor, while it extended it&#39;s top pair towards him, Antonio had no choice put to move like the wind, wrapping his arm around one of the rooms pillars to swing around it, the metallic monstrosity chasing close behind him, it&#39;s roar sounding like a mix between a power tool, a V8 engine and a lion on the hunt.<br />
Antonio dared to look behind himself as he retreated from it&#39;s grasping claws, gazing in horror as it used it&#39;s feet and clawed hands to clamber up and around the pillar after him, extending it&#39;s spine between its limbs to gain extra reach between each step, seeing no other option Antonio ran at a pillar and jumped, kicking off it&#39;s hard surface with all his strength, spinning in the air as his arm extended to length once more, cracking against the creatures face as it leaves towards him, the force so great it sent it crashing back towards the ground.<br />
<br />
Now with his arm wrapped around the pillar, his feet split into for secured to the pillars surface with penetrating force he watched as the beast recovered, getting up on two feet once again, extending all of its arms outwards as it&#39;s shoulders, elbows, wrists and palms shifted and extended what looked like exhausts from their panels, before it let out a roar, fire spewing from each exhaust vent, even it&#39;s mouth and nose, before it bagan scurrying up the pillar Antonio was on with alarming pace, swallowing his nerve Antonio unwrapped his arm and pushed off with his feet, taking chunks of it&#39;s metallic frame with him, his arm reached out as he flew towards the ground, whistling past the beast as his hand grasped at it&#39;s top jaw, pulling the creature down with him, yanking at it&#39;s top jaw with all his strength as they both plummeted towards the ground, swinging up and over the metalic monster as they fell, Antonio looped his arm around its top jaw, holding his cybernetic hand in his human one, before pulling himself downwards rapidly intp the creatures face, shattering both metalic chunks that clung to his cybernetic feet before they hoth landed on the ground with a powerful crash.<br />
<br />
Gasping for air Antonio pulled his arm free, retracting it back to its original form before holding his knees as he hunched over, desperate to get air in his lungs, every muscle burning with the amount of force he had made the human parts of his body put out, just as he began to catch his breath, his pulse finally settling in his veins and tubes he heard the mechanical systems of the creature behind him hum with motion, looking behind himself in horror as it rose to its feet, there was just no stopping this thing.<br />
However this time it did not attack, instead it sounded like it was.....chuckling?, before it burst out in a deep rumbling laughter, bellowing as it clutched it&#39;s sides, Antonio was at a loss, looking around the room in confusion, before a round of applause erupted from the statue, the various people there all clapping and cheering as the creature bellowed in laughter<br />
&quot;Hahahaha!, yes....I see now why my daughter has taken such interest in you now young man&quot; a unbelievably deep voice boomed, Turning around Antonio&#39;s eyes whent wide as he searched the room for the voices source, gasping as he reshaped his arm into a long blade like point<br />
&quot;Who said that, show yourself, I&#39;m not in the mood for fucking games!&quot; Antonio roared, his face in a snarl as he scanned the room<br />
&quot;Ummmmmm... I&#39;m right In Front of you boy&quot; the deep voice boomed with confusion.<br />
<br />
Antonio stopped dead, looking up in shock at the creatures face, that now seemed to be grinning at him with a kind smile, it spoke, the metalic beast spoke, Antonio fell backwards and began to scurry away from the metal giant<br />
&quot;Wha.... What the fuck are you?!&quot; He yelled as he began to swing his arm at it<br />
The creature let out a sigh as he extended his arm out, grasping Antonio by the ankle upsidedown and pulled him to be eye level with itself<br />
&quot;Well, to put it plainly, I&#39;m the one called the master, but you can call me Hatchimoto, or just Hatchi&quot; the creature chuckled<br />
&quot;Father, please put him down, if he&#39;s still alive I assume he passed your test, so stop toying with him&quot; a familiar voice called, Looking back towards the entrance Antonio stared wise eyed as Koshi and Kat walked up to the metal demon without a worry in the world<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you.....your her father?&quot; Antonio said in disbelief, the metal giant grinned at Antonio<br />
&quot;Indeed I am, and what a beautiful flower she had grown up to be, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot; He asked, his voice booming through Antonios entire body<br />
&quot;Mhm....yep she sure has.....can you put me down now?&quot; He asked in a terrified voice<br />
Hatchi&#39;s solid eyes whent wide as he hastily put Antonio the right way up on the ground<br />
&quot;A thousand apologies Antonio, I forget my own size and strength sometimes&quot; his chuckled, booming through the room, Antonio rushed over to Kat and Koshi as he turned to look up at Hatchi the giant, his hand instinctively reaching out to shield Kat&#39;s swollen belly, an action that Hatchi took instant notice of<br />
&quot;AHH, lady Kat, I see you are alot more......burdened, than last time I saw you&quot; the giant chuckled as he walked with thundering steps back towards the golden statue, taking a seat on the steps up to it.<br />
Kats face blushes a deep red as she placed both hands over her swollen womb<br />
&quot;Yes Lord Hatchi.....it was... quite a surprise for me and Antonio here....quite a rapid transformed&quot; she said with a nervous chuckle.<br />
<br />
Hatchi chuckled as he picked up Koshi in the palm of his hand, looking at her with warm eyes<br />
&quot;Yes....children often are a surprise, and they grow so fast....but it&#39;s all worth it in the end&quot; he smiled, his metalic mane pulsing in waves as he pressed his giant hey to his daughter in a type of embrace<br />
&quot;Father.....there&#39;s a reason I brought him to you, remember?&quot;<br />
Hatchi took a moment to think, then let out a sigh as he set Koshi back on the ground<br />
&quot;Ah my daughter....always got her mind set on business&quot; he said with an amused sigh, the master rose to his feet as he cracked all six of his cybernetic knuckles<br />
&quot;The reason I summoned you here Antonio, is to present you a gift, if you truly intend on bringing down a monster like Kovastov, then you will need what I offer you&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would that be?&quot; Antonio asked sceptically, raising an eyebrow as he watched Hatchi lower himself to be eye level with him<br />
&quot;I offer you controll of my clan, my equipment, my secrets, and my greatest treasure......my daughter&quot;</p>
