<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Selicia bolted upright from the dream delivered epiphany, she eyed the dark windows before checking the clock. Three forty seven A.M. Read the time on the display... It was early but, she wouldn&#39;t be able to rest until she knew for certain. Once she knew the fate of or had the staff in hand she could always come back for a nap. She lept out of her bed and threw on the first gown she could.<br />
<br />
She wanted to take someone with her if for no other reason than to have a potential warning of an ambush. So she ran downstairs and found the head maid&#39;s room letting herself in by magically undoing the lock. The room was dark but, Marina&#39;s soft breathing could be heard through the silence. Rushing to her bedside Selicia grabbed Marina&#39;s shoulders and started shaking the young woman while calling her name. Marina to her part proved to be quite the heavy sleeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.... No~ Stop~&quot; Giggled Marina dreamily. &quot;I couldn&#39;t~&quot; Her body limply lolling about as she was shaken further. She was snapped awake by a slap against her cheek. &quot;Ow... What was that for...&quot; Marina rubbed her pained cheek as her eyes adjusted to the dark. &quot;Once she recognized Selicia at her bedside, her mind cleared quickly with a start. &quot;Mistress?! Wh-what is it?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just come with me, Marina. I have urgent business to attend to and you will attend to me.&quot; Satisfied that the order was received, Selicia pulled on Marina&#39;s arm as the younger woman tried to go to her wardrobe. &quot;What you&#39;re wearing is fine, we must go now!&quot; Marina was wearing a sheer gown with a floral print, a bit odd for someone her age. For now though, apparel mattered not. Without exiting Marina&#39;s room, Selicia pulled them to the site of her tomb as she had days before with Debra.<br />
<br />
A feeling of magic being worked clung to the air prompting Selicia to pause before peering inside. Down below was another older woman bearing the crest of a House on her chest seeing to a investigative spell. Damn their reaction times, of course they&#39;d investigate but, Selicia had hoped for a little more time... It was not to be, so she had Marina watch the entrance to the tomb before she dove inside. She took only a few steps before launching a bolt toward the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have such poor timing... Sadly for you, you&#39;re in my way and at the worst possible time...&quot; To her credit the woman reacted quickly deflecting the bolt to the side. Just as she raised her staff to point it at Selicia, she was forced to deflect another. &quot;I told you, you&#39;re an obstacle... Do be a dear and step down for me...&quot; Her voice hardening, Selicia took another step forward and another shot taken at the mage. So the encounter went; Step... Bolt.... Step... Bolt... Step... Bolt... Until Selicia was close enough to grab the head of her staff. The mage panicked and in doing so made a last ditch effort to detonate all of her and the staff&#39;s power at once. The tomb was lit in a myriad of colors as the explosive magic flew wildly in every direction.<br />
<br />
The woman puffed in exhaustion as she observed the swirling cloud of colors. Allowing herself a smile, she leaned back against the wall to her back. If that witch could survive that then she&#39;s truly a monster she thought to herself. Just as she allowed herself a tired and rye chuckle about it, a hand shot forward grabbing her by the throat. Following the hand was a face she would never forget. Selicia&#39;s eyes unnatural glow seem magnified by the cloud to her back, the cold stare sent a freezing chill down her spine just as the flow of magic crept in behind it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you to step aside, you have not, you will not, now you pay for you insolence.&quot; A dreadful hiss underlined the statement as Selicia held the woman to the wall. With the mounting stress of Abernathy and the necessity of her task here, Selicia decided to make this woman&#39;s punishment something more... Unique... With her free hand Selicia tore the crest from the woman&#39;s clothes that proceeded to fall off of her body to the floor. There they contracted into a small cylinder by her feet turning a sharp pink color. Fear filled the woman&#39;s eyes as Selicia forced her to squat down along the wall as the lips of the mage&#39;s vagina began to part.<br />
<br />
With a wet popping sound, a similarly wet slap against stone floor as a flesh colored object fell impaling itself on the onto the cylinder. The object lost balance and wetly slapped the floor on its side with a small prolonged moan ushering from it. Meanwhile, the eyes of the woman had gone dull as it her mind had vacated it. In fact, as Selicia bent down to pick up the object leaving the body to stand on its own, it had. Held in her hand was a exact copy of the woman as a limbless onahole, unlike the ones in the past however, she spit and wriggled in Selicia&#39;s grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell... What the hell happened to me?!&quot; She sputtered the words as some of her fluids ran into her mouth. The woman seemed to notice Selicia now as a giant comparatively. &quot;What have you done to me?!&quot; Panic and anguish resounding from her tone as she wriggled helplessly. Her body seemed to have little in the support for itself aside from the rod buried impossibly deep within. As she wriggled, her C cup breasts pendulously swung side to side and her ass cheeks jiggled as they slapped against Selicia&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should look behind you, Dear~&quot; The tone of her voice dangerously sweet, Selicia nodded her head in the indicated direction.<br />
<br />
Shaking in fear as she looked over her shoulder, the woman screamed and thrashed seeing her body standing dully against the wall. &quot;No... No no no.... This can&#39;t be happening...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it can and it is, Dear. I told you... You were in the way~&quot; Holding the woman parallel to the floor, Selicia affixed the crest to the bottom of the shaft facing upward. She righted the woman once more with a wickedly smug grin. &quot;I made you a very special toy, both this form and that of your old one are -very- real~ Just like so~&quot; Humming a soft tune, Selicia turned the crest and the rod sprung to life vibrating the small form on it vigorously. Delighting in the toy&#39;s despair and pleasure she called the former host of her toy&#39;s soul forward. The body moved with the same grace it would&#39;ve ordinarily taking it&#39;s embodied soul into its hands. &quot;Now go above and stay there...&quot; Without a response the body carried the quivering, moaning mass in its hands up and out of the tomb.<br />
<br />
Selicia searched about the tomb again but, this time far more thoroughly as if it were still there it would be just as well hidden as when she sealed it.. Hours stretched on and the cries of pleasure had died out, assuming Marina had given mercy, Selicia continued her search. It was when she had decided to shove the pedestal out of frustration that she found the worn sigil. A panic rose within her, had they found it already? With more hope than confidence she deactivated the seal through the sigil and the way downward shimmered into view.<br />
<br />
Traveling down the dusty stairway through the darkness until braziers lit themselves at the bottom. Another door barred her way seemingly untouched as Selicia set about removing the bindings one by one. The door swung open once freed from the final binding and there within the chamber lit on either side by magical flame was the staff. Her former mistress and her unnamed fellow captive looked just like the day they&#39;d been abandoned underground. Taking the staff in hand, Selicia closed her eyes and felt the wellspring of power within it. Just as she felt it, it seemed a semiconscious awareness of the former Helena had felt her as well. If nothing else, that impressed Selicia that there was anything left of her after more than a thousand years.<br />
<br />
Exiting the tomb having resealed the chamber for no other reason other than confounding the houses, Selicia came upon the pair waiting on her. Marina had taken the smaller woman from her body and was casually playing with her as she seemed to have passed out. The body&#39;s hands were glistening in the rising sun&#39;s light. As Marina had stuck her finger in the woman&#39;s vagina having removed the vibrators, she squished the malleable body down until her fingertip poked through the tiny mouth causing a choked gag. She jumped in surprise when Selicia cleared her throat swiftly removing her sopping finger and cramming the vibrator back in place. Too much force was applied and the woman&#39;s small form was mashed to the base with the hot pink tip jutting from her mouth.<br />
<br />
Honestly a bit taken aback by the display, Selicia addressed the two of them. &quot;We&#39;re going home, I&#39;ve gotten what I came here for. &quot;Gesturing to the staff, Selicia then grabbed the two by their shoulders and quick-stepped them back to the manor. After placing the staff in a now sealed room, Selicia dismissed Marina back to her quarters and considered what to do with the mage&#39;s body. This was in reflection that Marina had mistaken taken the more animate of the two halves with her. A thought struck her and Selicia returned to the consultation room with a mannequin stand. A large ball placed at the top of it was inserted through the lower lips of the body leaving it appearing as a high end mannequin for casual inspection. A yawn escaped her lips and Selicia dismissed herself to her own quarters.</p>
