<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>There were plenty of ways to change your character's appearance and hide your actions.  You could disappear into airducts and down manhole covers.  Any way you might preform a crime had it's own way to get away with it, Sam had told him.  He insisted it wasn't as easy as it sounded, but done right, you could get away with murder… especially murdering an NPC.</p>

<p>But that also meant that part of hiding what he was going to do had to do with appearing or not appearing guilty.  Being polite to police officers and never admitting to a crime where two of the easiest ways to get away with something.  If you never gave off the air of being a criminal, no one would ever think you were.</p>

<p>By that logic, though, whichever one of these characters he choose, it needed to be someone who wasn't like him (he thought) and it also had to be someone who wouldn't appear to be a criminal.  A woman was the obvious choice, and since he didn't care about sex appeal or even girls as it was, it would be easy enough to carry on normally.</p>

<p>He stepped over to the young woman who looked like a skunk.  To him, it was just an animal-looking older girl… like a cartoon figure or a StarFox character.  She looked like she was about the size of an eighteen year old, and her breasts sat round and firm across her chest.  Her form was a little too feminine and idealized, which to Denise meant some pervert probably created the character.</p>

<p>Criss-crossed across her front, and leading down to the sides, the yellow material of the bikini both across the nipples and up under her crotch left nothing for an adult male mind to wonder.  In this case, Denise didn't have an adult mind, so he just shook his head of the appearance of whatever it was older boys saw in girls.</p>

<p>The sides of her face had white fur to them, but over the center and back her fur was black.  There was a white V-shape in white that came down over the sides of her head and met just between her eyes.  Long and too her shoulders was white hair, though, and she wore yellow-rimmed glasses.  Her tail, also, was a design of mostly black with a white stripe that went down and met near it's end in an almost V like the one on her forehead.</p>

<p><i>Yellow-rimmed glasses,</i> Denise thought.  <i>How innocent is that</i> he asked waving his hand in front of her face, though the statue there along the marble room kept it's pose of about to hit a volley ball or something.  As he looked at her, he noticed the field of view outside the arches of this character select hall began to have beach on one side and city on the other, the smell of salt water in the air.  In his ghostly form, it was all dim, but it was still a cool effect.</p>

<p><i>Stephanie Mary Louis…</i> Denise thought as he did the hand motion for menu and hit 'Enter The Kingdom', <i>Three first names… like like a serial killer,</i> he smirked as the world faded into white.  The sense that his body was no longer there was a strange feeling, but he could hear the sounds of waves crashing and of people talking somewhere along the beach, having fun.</p>

<p>A moment later, Denis could feel the loading like a warm and smothering blanket all over his body.  It wasn't like he could feel himself change size so much as it was like he felt the world move and stretch around him.  His legs felt longer, his butt became rounder, his penis and balls flatted up against his body until all he was left with there was a mound.</p>

<p>He could feel the cloth against his ghostly form fade away as his chest ballooned outward into reasonably sized young adult breasts.  A tingling at his tailbone was joined by a weight against his back and spine as a long and bushy skunk tail almost stretched (not grew) out from behind him.  His new pure-white hair fell around his shoulders.</p>

<p>Every part of his body, even his new womanhood, formed into tighter and more muscled.  Lean and powerful, there were claws just off her toes and fingers, and he could feel as the tight yellow thong formed out from his flesh up and over his crotch, up and over his tail with a snap, and criss-cross from behind him up under his armpits to go across his new breasts and attach at a thick ring around his neck.</p>

<p>As the barely two minutes worth of loading finished, he saw the rims of the thick yellow glasses push out from behind his cute little ears under his hair and form just over his short muzzle.  He took in a breath, the first one of this body, and felt how all his insides, muscles and all, form and size seemed to change completely.</p>

<p>For anyone else, this might have seemed amazing.  For Denise, it was on some level… but on another it was like he had allowed someone too close.  Though he hadn't yet taken a sex-ed class, he knew enough to think older guys were silly to hover over anything they saw as attractive.  Without puberty yet with him, Denise just didn't get it.</p>

<p>What he got was that this was very <i>very</i> real.  He ran his hands along the thong over his thighs, moving his hands up along his sides and up to cup his breasts, looking down at them.  Everything was furry, to be sure, but he otherwise didn't see the appeal.  If nothing else, though, this would be one hell of a ride.</p>

<p>Stephanie looked around.  She was standing just beside an ice-cream stand on the sidewalk between a huge public beach and a large cityscape.  Just behind her were children playing with an oversized earth ball, men and woman playing volleyball, some out in the waves swimming, some surfing, and a few lifeguards spaced up and down the beach.</p>

<p>Ahead of her and beyond the ice cream, hot dog, cotton candy, and salty pretzel stands was a very green park with more children playing.  There were two baseball diamonds opposite each other with marks to indicate that sometimes the length of the two fields were used as a football (soccer) field.  There was a group of children there all playing tag.</p>

<p>Off beyond that was rural neighborhood… and further beyond that was cityscape.  Skyscrapers reached up into the clear blue sky, not a sign of smog or clouds around.  An airplane flew by in the distance, and then another, each one carrying some kind of message, "Will you marry me, CheetahGirl67?" and "Your Ad Here: Advertise to the Whole Kingdom" were what they said.</p>

<p>"Can I help?" was a man's voice just behind her.  Stephanie put on her fake smiling face that Denise always used and turned back to look at who had called her.  On Stephanie, however, it was downright warm and inviting.</p>

<p>She turned around to see an anthropomorphic lion man approaching from the sands of the beach.  His hair fell against his shoulders in curly waves and his muscles and shoulders gave off that must have come to the beach often to use the sea-side gym.  He wore orange trunks with black glyph-looking designs on them, and had one hand out in her general direction.</p>

<p>She realized that his outstretched had was vaguely pointing at her and she looked down to see she was still cupping her breasts.  Feeling a bit silly, but also very annoyed, she put her hands down at her side.  She kept the smile up as Denise was good with appearances, but she thought to herself that this larger male might be her first victim.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and her voice was sweet and caring.  Though Denise's voice had not yet changed, it was not the voice of a child exactly… it was a young woman's voice that in some kind of strange way did kind of sound like his own.  Denise made a note to avoid all teamspeak or else he would give away his true self as he hadn't yet thought about it until right then.</p>

<p>"Yes," she repeated just as sweetly the second time, "You look like just the kind of guy to help me," she smiled warmly.</p></p>
