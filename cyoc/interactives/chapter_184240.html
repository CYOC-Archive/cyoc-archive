<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Holly, can you change your brother’s diaper while we get things inside from the trailer?” Skyler asked. “Ugh… mom. I don’t want to. Can’t I get a break for once?” Holly complained. “Look, just do it for your brother before he gets a rash.” Skyler insisted as Holly barely had a choice. <br />
<br />
Daniel was then carried by her older sister to the back of her car, where she brought her mom’s diaper bag and a changing blanket and proceeded to change his diaper. She pulled down her brother’s pants to reveal the mushy garment beneath his shirt. “Oh boy…” Holly gulps in reluctance as her hand approaches the dirty diaper. She slowly untapes the diaper before immediately recoiling and gagging. “Ah geez, now it smells even worse!” Holly soon composes herself and quickly plops the messy diaper onto a plastic bag nearby. <br />
<br />
Daniel couldn’t help but burst into laughter at her brother’s reactions as he kicks his little feet. “Hardee har har, easy for you to laugh when you’re not the one having to change poopy diapers.” Holly groans again and wipes Daniel’s bottom thoroughly, reflexively cringing as she does so. “Phew, the hardest part is finally over with.” Holly then powders Daniel’s bottom before snuggly taping a clean diaper around his waist. “How does mom get through changing your diapers?” Holly groans before pulling Daniel’s pants up and setting him down from his makeshift changing area in the car.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Holly’s parents were talking to their new neighbors known as the Owlburrows, who went up to introduce themselves a little bit after they saw a moving trailer near the recently sold house. “Hi, welcome to the neighborhood. I’m Sarah, this is my husband, and this is my adorable son Brendan.” She greeted them.<br />
<br />
“Aww, that’s one of the cutest little tykies I’ve seen.” She complimented Brendan as he giggled as she proceeded to speak to him in baby talk, still laughing from the cute and silly noises she made. “I have an adorable son that seems to be his age.” She told Skyler. “Oh that’s great, maybe they could have playdates later.” Sarah said as she was flattered.<br />
<br />
Well, I’m Skyler and this is my husband Jesse. We just moved in from Mapleboro after he got promoted by the company. He’s going to be working at TransDem’s corporate headquarters starting Monday.” She introduced herself. “Oh, that’s nice. I work as a brand manager there. What division are you working for?” Harold mentioned. “I’m going to be with the invention guys, working with doodads and stuff like that.” Jesse gladly responded.<br />
<br />
“That’s awesome. I sometimes talk to the inventors there for certain things about the company’s brands.” Sarah was starting to become curious on their relationship. “So what is your kid’s name?” Jesse and Skyler laughed with her, as they seem to be curious. “Well, his name is Daniel. He’s named after my grandpa.” “Where is he?” Sarah asked. <br />
<br />
“My daughter’s changing his diaper right now. We ate breakfast at a diner nearby. It was a pretty long drive before we got here, so it was no wonder that his tummy already got that food in his diaper somewhat quickly.” Skyler then called for her daughter so they could meet their new neighbors. “Holly, sweetie. Come meet our new neighbors.” She moaned as she walked towards her parents with Brendan holding her hand in a poutful manner. “Can I at least stay in the house after I see them? I really don’t want to be here while you two are talking.” Holly said as she was still bummed.<br />
<br />
“Actually, you’ll be helping your dad to bring in all the stuff from the trailer. So you don’t need to be with me during our little conversation.” Skyler insisted. “Ugh… Fine.” She continued her upset moaning. “Well, she seems to be quite a handful.” Sarah noted. “Yeah, I’m sorry. She doesn’t seem to be thrilled with the move. She wanted to be with her friends to go to Six Flags before we told her.”<br />
<br />
“Oh. How unfortunate. You know, Brendan seems to be like that where he wants to go to the toy store after I get groceries, but I only let him go there if he behaves well in the car.” “That reminds me when Holly was little and we were trying to potty train her. She didn’t want to go to the bathroom so we bribed her with candy and toys if she went there. I remember one summer when we went to visit my brother down at Florida, the hotel we stayed at had this wonderful pool. So, we went there to go swimming after we visited my brother, and I asked Holly if she wanted to try going potty before we went. She then told me, ‘No. I went potty in pool.’ The lifeguard had to get everyone out once somebody saw some pee from Holly.” Holly blushed heavily when hearing this story, given that she never wanted her mom to mention this story to anybody.<br />
<br />
“Mommm.” She said loudly. “After that, we kept her in those training pants that felt like diapers since we thought she was going to have another accident.” She continued. “Mom, please stop telling people we just met about that.” Holly felt annoyed. “What? It was funny since you told me. You even had your favorite stuffed animal as your potty buddy. Lighten up, Holly.” Skyler slightly giggled.<br />
<br />
“Well, we are trying to potty train little Brendan. But he doesn’t seem to be very interested in going to our bathroom. We even tried going in my mother’s bathroom when we visited her, since she always seem to have extravagant bathrooms in her house. So, we’re still keeping him in diapers for a while.” Sarah told her new neighbors. “I’m going inside.” A disgruntled Holly said before she stormed out and Daniel was next to her mother. . “You still have to carry our stuff into the house with your dad.” Skyler said to her. “I’m so sorry about Holly. She’s usually happy, but the move made her upset and I think I made it worse with that embarrassing story.” <br />
<br />
“No, it’s okay. Brendan’s like that sometimes. In fact, one time he threw a tantrum when he was out playing in the little playground at the park where I wanted to change his diaper. So after a little bit, I took him to a restroom nearby where it had a changing station and I distracted him with his favorite stuffed animal. He remained happy as he had a clean diaper on before we went back home.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, my little Daniel is like that as well. Especially when it comes to sweets. We rarely give him any, but he already has a sweet tooth. Holly was like that as well when she was growing up.” Skyler responded. Sarah and the other parents smiled as the story was adorable to them. Meanwhile, Holly went inside her new house as she was still sulking over this new move. As she got her phone out from her pocket, she listened to some music before her dad tapped her on the shoulder. In which he was reminding her that she should get some of the boxes out from the trailer already.   <br />
<br />
After a while, Holly and Jesse got almost all of the boxes out from the trailer and safely put it inside their new home. “Well, that’s pretty much all of it. You can just chill out here if you want.” Jesse said calmly to her daughter as he went out to the front yard to get the rest of the boxes. As she was bored, she listened to her music on her phone while texting her friends to see what they were up to. “Finally, I get a break after being in that car for so long.” Holly was relieved before her mom came in.</p>
