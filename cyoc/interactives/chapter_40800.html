<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While waiting in the line for the large tubing slide, Mark and Cal found themselves in front of two young men who seemed to be bumping into them more than necessary.<br />
<br />
Mark turned to address the two men, &quot;Excuse me, do you two have to follow so close?&quot; asked Mark.<br />
<br />
The light brown haired man smiled, his eyes fixated on Mark's well endowed bosom, and said, &quot;I'm sorry, I seem to be a bit clumsy today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other man with dark hair smiled, while trying to stifle a laugh, &quot;I'm sorry too, I keep tripping over this guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal found himself looking back at the two men, who were wearing very tight spandex swimsuits that showed both men were circumcised.<br />
<br />
As the line modestly moves closer to the top, the two men behind Cal and Mark continue to brush against them, one even went so far as to slide his hand inside Cal's leg while pretending to fall. Mark turned to the two men, &quot;Please keep a distance from us, I will not ask again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both men laughed as Mark turned back from them. Mark leaned over to Cal, and whispered &quot;Let's invite them for a special show.&quot; Cal nodded back. As the line moved to the top, Mark and Cal quietly worked out a plan.<br />
<br />
As the line moved closer to the top, the light haired man leaned forward to Cal and asked, &quot;Is she your boyfriend?&quot; Cal grumbled, and reached around to slap the same man who tried to slide his hand down the back of his swimsuit bottom, only to slap air as the man quickly pulled away. Finally, Cal and Mark were all too happy to slide down, if only to get away from the two frisky men. Once at the bottom, the two waited for the men to slide down. Both men smiled as they stood up out of the water to see the two women, waist deep, by the steps.<br />
<br />
Mark called out, &quot;Hi boys, I'm Marie. This is my friend Kay. How would you like to show us a good time?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two men looked at each other and laughed. The dark colored one said, &quot;OK, sure. Follow us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal and Mark followed the two men to a small building that was marked &quot;Keep Out&quot;. One of the men used a key in a flower pot next to the door to unlock and open the door. Inside, there was a couple of offices and two large couches in a waiting area.<br />
<br />
Mark said, &quot;So boys, what are your names?&quot;<br />
<br />
The light haired boy, who turned on the lights said, &quot;I'm Tom, and my here friend is Derek.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal turned to Derek and asked, &quot;So, what made us so special to attract your attention?&quot;<br />
<br />
Derek and Tom both laughed, then Derek answered &quot;You ladies have a certain quality. And you didn't get security for what we did in the line.&quot; Derek paused for a bit, and added, &quot;And Kay here kept looking back to check out our rock hard cocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark and Cal were unsure still, but unknown to them, Tom and Derek had yet to pay attention to anything besides the tit and ass Mark and Cal possessed. Mark and Cal turned to the two men, and smiled, their own cocks now rock hard, and bulging through their suits.<br />
<br />
Tom was quicker than Derek, &quot;Dude, they are dudes!&quot; Derek smiled, &quot;Dude, the are totally hot.&quot; With that cue, Cal went over to Derek, and began to rub 'her' body next to his. Mark went over to Tom, and said, &quot;You sure you don't want to try it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom shook his head no, and turned to the door, but found the collar quickly around his neck. Tom's mind quickly changed, and he turned back to Mark, wrapped his arms around 'her' waist, and pulled Mark's bulge into his.<br />
<br />
Cal asked Derek, &quot;I'll meet you on the couch.&quot; As Derek turned to step over to on of the couches, Cal removed the dildo from his pussy and reached over to put it in Mark's hand. Tom would be first.<br />
<br />
As Cal went to join Derek on the couch, Derek had already slipped of the spandex square trunks. Cal slowly removed his suit and watched as Derek was in a dream state, slightly drooling. After Cal stepped out of his suit, Derek's eyes were now admiring Cal's generous sized canine cock and balls, as they were bigger than Derek's. <br />
<br />
Cal asked &quot;How about doggie style?&quot; <br />
<br />
Derek quickly nodded, then said &quot;You bend over, me first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cal assumed the bent over position on the end of the couch, while Derek stepped up from behind. Cal reached between his legs to slide Derek's cock into his pussy instead of his ass. Soon Derek was thrusting his hips into Cal's canine pussy.<br />
<br />
Mark was enjoying the attention of Tom's arms, massaging 'her' bubble-butt ass. &quot;Mark, take off your suit please.&quot; asked Mark. Tom let go of Mark's butt long enough to step out of his pair of spandex trunks. Mark used the time to also slide out of his swimsuit. After Mark was naked, Tom stepped cock to cock with Mark, and began grinding his hips into 'hers', while wrapping his hands around 'her' waist again. This was ideal for Mark, as he whispered into Tom's ear. &quot;You love my cock and balls, and you love my breasts. Your greatest desire is to have a set of breasts like mine, and a wonderful dog cock and balls. You are attracted to and will mate with anyone who has breasts and a dog cock or pussy. You love to suck dick.&quot; Mark repeated this over and over as Tom slid his cock along side 'hers'. With one hand, Mark readied the dildo between Tom's ass-cheeks, while the other hand was ready to unbuckle the collar. And with expert precision and timing, the collar came away as the dildo slid in. &quot;Slide down to the couch with me&quot;, whispered Mark. Slowly, the two knelt down onto the couch, with Mark slowly thrusting the dildo into Tom. By the time Mark was laying on the couch under Tom, the changes were in progress. Tom's chest began to put some distance between the two as his E cup breasts formed. Tom's grinding of his cock changed slightly as a furred sheath and balls and slick canine cock replaced his human organs. Mark felt his job was done when Tom's body tensed, and his first canine ejaculation pumped between their bellies. As Mark pulled out the dildo, Tom moved down to lick his spunk off Mark's well toned, athletic stomach.<br />
<br />
Mark looked over to Cal and Derek, who had already switched positions and now Cal was thrusting 'her' cock into Derek's ass. As Tom finished licking Mark clean, Mark asked, &quot;Why don't you sit in that office and milk those huge balls between your legs.&quot; As Tom got up and went to the next office, Mark got up and stepped over to Derek, putting the collar around his neck. Cal kept thrusting his cock as Mark began to speak softly into Derek's ear. &quot;You love cock and pussy, and your greatest desire is to have a canine cock and pussy between your legs. Your strongest urge is to fill that canine pussy with good canine cock, like the one your friend Tom has. You crave the taste of his spunk. You also hate loose clothes, you only want to wear tight clothing made from synthetics or silk. When you see bare nipples, your first thought is to suck on them.&quot; Mark repeats this over and over for a few minutes as Cal's knot is tied in Derek's ass. Cal alerts Mark that his knot is about to shrink enough to pull out, and gets the dildo from Mark. Cal slips out of Derek's stretched anus, and once Mark pulls off the collar, quickly begins thrusting the dildo into Derek. After a few minutes of the thrusting, Derek lets out a groan as his new canine cock erupts in orgasm. Cal slowly pulls out the dildo, and before he slides it into his pussy, Mark reaches out, &quot;My turn.&quot; Mark takes the dildo and slides it into his pussy while handing Cal the collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, then I need to go a few rounds with these guys to get my fix.&quot; stated Cal, who felt a strong need to slide something into his canine vagina.<br />
<br />
Mark pointed to the office, &quot;Go play with Tom for a while, and then we can switch.&quot; Cal walked over to the office where Tom was busy masturbating his canine cock. Mark stepped over behind Derek, and slide his throbbing canine cock between Derek's new canine pussy lips. With a soft whimper from Derek, Mark began to pound away.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Mark and Cal closed the outside door to the unused offices with Derek and Tom busy with their own orgy. Cal noted, &quot;At least if they get frisky with us again, it will be a lot more fun. And we know where the key is to a private place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark replied, &quot;You said it. Let's check out the wave pool.&quot; Cal nodded and the two headed to the wave pool.</p>
