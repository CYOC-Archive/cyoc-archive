<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They waited awhile in the cave and talked about what to do and how they each thought they should survive. They decided that the cave would probably be the best way to go as far as shelter, and that clothing wasn’t much of an option. However while John suggested that they should hunt for food and fly around above to locate water, Aaron refused to exit the cave in her fully exposed body.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to go outside sometime Aaron, at the very least to get some fresh air every now and then.&quot; John said<br />
<br />
&quot;You have scales and breathe fire, okay? I&#39;m not going out there without at least some clothing.&quot; She replied <br />
<br />
John sighed at this and said,&quot;Okay, how about this? I&#39;ll go out and hunt, look for water and all of that. However you’re at least coming with me whenever you need to drink something, and until we get clothes I&#39;ll bring back stuff and skin it, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how to do that?&quot; Aaron asked<br />
<br />
John shrugged and replied,&quot;I can sure as hell try, and we could probably make a small fire in here... you know, unless you wanna huddle together for warmth.&quot;<br />
<br />
A stricken look suddenly appeared on Aaron&#39;s face now after John mentioned that, and she bit her lip. John paused when she saw Aaron like this, so she got a bit closer and asked,&quot;What’s wrong? Is it... the boobs? The pussy? Just... everything about our bodies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Something like that I guess...&quot; Aaron muttered, her hand slowly inching towards her own pussy.<br />
<br />
John noticed this and gave her a puzzled look as Aaron moved her other hand up towards her breast and cupped one of them. &quot;Aaron, are you sure you’re okay?&quot; John asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I...&quot; Aaron muttered and rubbed her breast, and started caressing and fingering her sensitive folds. John’s eyes widened at this and she blushed, watching Aaron do this remaining silent until Aaron let out an audible moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron, what the fuck?! What’s gotten into you?!&quot; John growled<br />
<br />
Aaron just continued playing with herself, squeezing her breast in one hand and the other had a finger shallowly penetrating her cunt. &quot;I... c-can’t stop.... it feels s-so hot for s-some reason. C-can’t think straight j-just.... fuck me ugh!&quot; She moaned loudly <br />
<br />
John blushed red at this, and she wasn’t sure what exactly she was watching or what was wrong. Five minutes ago Aaron refused to even touch her newfound breasts, and now she was groping one of them while penetrating herself. However while John watched this she for some reason felt... turned on by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Aaron you...&quot; John began then Aaron cried,&quot;F-fuck! I-I need.... relief! H-help...please.&quot;<br />
<br />
John continued watching and clenched her fist trying to refuse this lust that was building up inside of her, and not succumb to it like Aaron had. John continued watching and thought to herself,&quot;A-Am I.... into this? I-I was a guy... so... it does make sense, I think? But I&#39;m sure I&#39;m straight, but.... if I was only straight th-that would mean...&quot; John looked down at her body and briefly imagined how she would look at nine months pregnant and shuddered. <br />
<br />
&quot;P-Perhaps if I j-just embrace this th-than guys will know n-not to fuck me... and... fill me with..... eggs.&quot; John thought, and found her own fingers moving towards the soft slit between her own legs.<br />
<br />
Aaron let out one last cry of pleasure before John looked down at her body and roared,&quot;Fuck it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron briefly looked up at John because of the sudden outburst and John looked back at her. &quot;Aaron.... don’t you dare tell anyone about what I&#39;m about to do right now, got it?!&quot; John growled gritting her teeth.<br />
<br />
Aaron saw the look on John’s face and nodded, not ready caring or knowing what John would do until the dragoness got down on all fours and crawled up to her face. &quot;Aaron.... before I do anything I want you to know, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; John said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-why? Unnngh...&quot; Aaron moaned in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... embrace whatever you feel, okay, I think it’ll help, after this,&quot; John said then she hugged Aaron tightly, squishing their breasts up against each other, and John kissed Aaron on the mouth. <br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s eyes went wide the moment John’s mouth met hers, and she wanted to punch John right in the gut. However she was filled with mixed emotions over this, but mostly it was her lust and passion. She embraced John completely and kissed back with passion, their tongues scaling the interior of each others&#39; mouths before they pulled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-John...?&quot; Aaron muttered with a lust filled expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you fuck me I&#39;ll fuck you, you sexy slut.&quot; John growled<br />
<br />
Aaron wasn’t prepared for this as John moved lower down towards Aaron’s cunt. John&#39;s muzzle barely touched the outer rim of it, and her nose sniffed at it. The dragoness hadn’t a clue what to expect from what she was about to do, but she gulped anyways and started licking Aaron’s pussy.<br />
<br />
Aaron moaned loudly and almost screamed from the lust alone from this motion, and John paused and blushed out of disbelief. Still, John didn’t dislike the taste, in fact she wanted more of it so she started licking more and more, each time getting a little bit deeper.<br />
<br />
Aaron moaned louder and louder with each lick then cried,&quot;S-So hot! N-Need....m-more!&quot;<br />
<br />
John then stopped where she was and paused then looked to her tail and sighed. Aaron watched this, but was clueless as to what was going to happen until John sat next to her and position her tail at the base of her pussy.<br />
<br />
Without a moment to spare John thrusted her tail up into her friend’s needy pussy and Aaron moaned and screamed as the large object penetrated deep into her pussy. &quot;Y-You’re s-so...s-so...&quot; Aaron muttered then John brought her hands up and around the succubus&#39;s tits and squeezed them causing her to moan more as the two sat there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your breasts... feel so soft compared to mine.&quot; John commented blushing before she forced her tail deeper up Aaron’s cunt causing her to moan louder and louder.<br />
<br />
Eventually Aaron found herself snuggling up to John, and even on the lap of the busty, scaly beast. &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m hurting you.&quot; John whimpered, but Aaron shook her head and screamed,&quot;Almost there, just...fffuck!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this John lightly pinched Aaron’s tits, and thrusted her tail into Aaron as hard as she could and the succubus finally let out a climaxing scream, and her juices spilled out all over John’s tail. John blushed seeing her tail covered in Aaron’s feminine body fluids, and Aaron leaned in against John’s breasts, exhausted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That..... was...... wonderful,&quot; Aaron said breathing heavily now.<br />
<br />
John blushed at this and said,&quot;W-Well uh.... just don’t tell anyone about this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron nodded and said,&quot;I wouldn’t mind if we did... at least around here and not back at the university.&quot;<br />
<br />
John paused and sighed at this, then nodded to her lover and said,&quot;Aaron, next time something like this comes up... uh....&quot; John paused and blushed.<br />
<br />
Aaron looked back at her and replied,&quot;What is it? We’re all alone still.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Next time I want to be the one.... fucked like you.&quot; John said blushing red.<br />
<br />
There was a large awkward silence for a few long seconds before Aaron finally responded, and it was a giggle. John turned towards Aaron curiously now only to be kissed once more on the mouth by the succubus and knocked to the ground.<br />
<br />
Aaron now smiled at John and said,&quot;How about we agree on something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...okay?&quot; John replied<br />
<br />
&quot;If that happens to me again then you’ll always give me a piece of that ass, or tail... whenever I need it. I’ll show you my affection in return when you want it, okay?&quot; Aaron replied<br />
<br />
&quot;I...o-oh Uh... yeah sure.&quot; John replied then paused and asked,&quot;Would you find it weird if I called you.... cute?&quot;<br />
<br />
John blushed again and Aaron smiled back and said,&quot;Not if you don’t think it’s weird for me to call you a sexy bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
John laughed at this and said,&quot;We’re both sluts now!&quot; She pressed her talons together awkwardly. &quot;So... girlfriends? Partners? Mates?&quot; John asked unsure.<br />
<br />
Aaron paused then blushed a deep red, and she slapped John right in the face. &quot;Ack! Point taken just...&quot; John began than Aaron caught her off guard by kissing her on the lips again, and this one lasted twice as long as the last one.<br />
<br />
Aaron then giggled and said,&quot;As long as your a sexy fire breathing whore then I&#39;m your slutty demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
John blushed at this then smiled at Aaron seductively and hugged her to the ground with her. &quot;Aaron, I love that idea!&quot; John shouted.<br />
<br />
The two continued talking for awhile before they eventually decided that they should move on from this moment. So after their passionate heart to heart they decided to...</p>
