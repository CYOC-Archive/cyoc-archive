<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It is now morning (you guess) <br />
<br />
You wake up to the smell of cooking food.<br />
<br />
You open your eyes, your still your favorite loli, your still in the sleeping bag.<br />
<br />
You are alone however, you can’t find your cute loli cat sister/ girlfriend anywhere. You would panic, however you smell cooking food and hear humming. You guess that’s her. You inch your way out of the sleeping bag, the hairs excite your smooth vigina something fierce as you pass over them, but you get out of the bag on your hands and knees. You stand up and stretch. Making cute ‘Mmmmmngh’ and ‘Nnnnnngh-Aaahh’ noises as you do so. You scratch your smooth slightly fat stomach. <br />
<br />
You smell the food and hear your stomach growl. You look down and place both hands on your smooth slightly fat stomach. You think it makes sense your so hungry all of a sudden, after all you haven’t eaten anything in...<br />
<br />
... FOUR DAYS!?<br />
<br />
(At least Three, Two in the jungle with your now tiger loli girlfriend/ Sister. Plus today and the day you first changed)<br />
<br />
Well okay, when you think about it they weren’t exactly four FULL days. But still.<br />
<br />
How is that possible?<br />
<br />
How could you have just forgotten to eat ANYTHING FOUR DAYS in a row!?<br />
<br />
Well okay, you were busy most of the time. You blush to yourself as your hands move closer to your exposed vigina, remembering the previous few days events very clearly. But never eating ANYTHING!?<br />
<br />
Were you immortal now?<br />
<br />
(The thought of just you and this body alone for all time made you blush like crazy.)<br />
<br />
Was it the sex and self pleasure keeping you going the whole time?<br />
<br />
You hunch over and blush in embarrassment , as your stomach growels again even loader.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the answer you clearly needed food NOW, but that still doesn’t answer if you are immortal or not. Your pretty sure your only THIS hungry after thinking about it so much. Does that mean stuff only effects you if you acknowledge it? Would you stop aging and live for ever if you just don’t think about time?<br />
<br />
Will you never get sick again?<br />
<br />
You make your way into the door nexus, scratched your still sensitive ass now, you couldn’t find your signature outfit anywhere in your room but figured it would turn up eventually, and was probably just being washed by the mysterious force or something.<br />
<br />
Finding were the kitchen was was easy. It was the only door slightly open, with light coming from it. You could also smell the delicious food inside. Pancakes, Bacon, Toast, and Eggs.<br />
<br />
As you approach you slow your pace, listening to the sweet song being humbed inside. You stop before reaching the handle. You almost don’t want to go in and interrupt the song being sung.<br />
<br />
The temperature difference of the room with all the stuff being cooked in causes a slight breeze to come out of the door crack, caressing your exposed vigina.<br />
<br />
You slowly sigh with delight, then slowly creek open the door. The kitchen was lit by orange light like the Bath room and all made of wood. The counters seemed somewhat too high for you in your current form. However there were wooden stools at several points you felt you could use. To your right was a massive table stretching into the darkness beyond the well lit kitchen near the entrance infront of you. You still hear the angelic humming and breefly wonder its source. Till you see your favorite tiger loli Sister/ girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Her striped tail was swinging in time with the song she was humming. She kept jumping between three points in the kitchen. She was cooking Pancakes, Bacon and, Eggs on three different counters. She jumped between the stools with practiced grace, never missing a beat of her song.<br />
<br />
She was also only wearing an apron.<br />
<br />
And once you notice this once she tuned to attend the eggs on the central counter, you nearly fall over and expose your presses. At the sight of her perfect round ass with a tail at the top.<br />
<br />
Your face is blood red at this point. <br />
<br />
Watching as she springs from stool to stool, her hair flowing in the wind, apron going between her legs with each jump. Never missing a beat.<br />
<br />
At one point you observe her flipping pancakes with her tail while scrambling the eggs with her hands.<br />
<br />
She was an angel, in both body and in voice. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
She looks almost done with breakfast at this point. She turns away from the door and begins work on the waffle batter, never missing a beet.<br />
<br />
You figured now is as good a time as any to surprise her, while she was distracted starting a new project, you slowly creek open the door and tip toe into the kitchen, the breakfast on the central counter looks divine. Your almost temped to sample some of the syrup, however no. You were on a mission. The naked souls of your feet make no noises as you pass over the wooden floor.<br />
<br />
However you still time your steps with her hums. Knowing the melody practically by heart at this point.<br />
<br />
Speaking of naked, you run into your first issue when forced to surpress a moan as a cold up draft moves cross you, right between your naked legs.<br />
<br />
You eventually reach your last obstacle, dodging her swinging striped tail. You think this is the first time you’ve seen her ass clearly, and MAN did you have some SERIOUS competition in the caboose department. You could stop there, by grabbing her tail or ass, however you wanted the KILL.<br />
<br />
You jump onto the stool she currently occupied and squeeze her breasts under her apron right in time with her next hum.<br />
<br />
“KYYyyyyAAAaAaahmmm!!”<br />
<br />
Success<br />
<br />
She flips the batter in the big kitchen spoon over your head and turns to face you. Crossing her arms and blushing from each of her cheeks, and across her nose. The blush was only interrupted by the two black stripes on each of her cheeks. Four in total.<br />
<br />
“Wha-Why Would Yo—“<br />
<br />
You interrupted her yet again with a kiss. She drops the kitchen spoon as you move your tongue into her mouth, she uncrosses her arms and places her adorable furry paws around your head. You rap your arms around her, and she raps her tail around your waist. You pull eachother close together, only a thin layer of rough white fabric now separated you. But the two of you can still feel the heat of eachothers viginas through the fabric. Eventually the two of you break the sloppy kiss. Both sighing in delight, both blushing red at eachothers nakedness, as well as memories of your time together.<br />
<br />
She leans into your flat loli chest on top of the stool.<br />
<br />
“Why do you keep doing this to me?” She asks and you respond.<br />
<br />
‘Because we both love it’ the two of you smile. You begin to think that she loves your adorable voice just  as much as you do.<br />
<br />
However she later comes to her senses, and pushes you off the wooden stool you both stood on. Your massive loli ass slaps onto the hard cold wood floor.<br />
<br />
She looks down at you from her stool. <br />
<br />
“You ruined my breakfast surprise for you!” she yells, stomping her foot onto the wooden stool and causing it to wobble and her massive tits to jiggle under her white apron as she yells at you.<br />
<br />
You apologize, and she gets back to making breakfast in a somewhat less cheery mood. No more humming, you hope she doesn’t give up singing forever, you did genuinely like her voice, and not just because you think she’s hot.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Regardless of her mood she does finish making the two of you breakfast. You slide onto one of the many empty seets of the table and let out a small moan of joy as you feel the cold leather against your massive sensitive loli ass.<br />
<br />
She places the breakfast infront of you, you wait for her to sit down as well but she just looks at you.<br />
<br />
“Well dig in already”<br />
<br />
You gladly oblige, scarfing down cinimon sticks, slices of waffles, and eggs into your mouth in the first bite.<br />
<br />
‘Mmmph Esh Showw Goood’<br />
<br />
She hits you with a kitchen spoon to the back of the head. You imagine your eyes as spirals at this point.<br />
<br />
“Now talking with your mouth full” she lectures. You rub the back of your head.<br />
<br />
You scarf down 3 more helpings before trying to talk again.<br />
<br />
‘So’ You ask ‘how’d you learn to cook so good?’<br />
<br />
She seams embarrassed by the question, she was currently preparing your 5th helping for you.  <br />
<br />
“Well, when you live in a jungle it helps to know how to spice up your food, keep things interesting.” She kneeds her pawed hands together.<br />
<br />
‘That doesn’t explain how you know how to make such GREAT PANCAKES’ you say, drizzling a stack with syrup for enfisis <br />
<br />
“the instructions are on the side of the box” she said sounding insulted “I’m not illiterate”<br />
<br />
You don’t get why she’s so upset with you, just said they were great.<br />
<br />
 By the time you finish helping 8 and she finished making helping 10, she finally sits down with you to eat, able to tell you were nearly full by this point and it was now her turn to eat.<br />
<br />
‘So, why just the apron?’ You ask<br />
<br />
Her face turns dark red. “I-I-I could not find our normal clothes this morning” she says trying to sound dignified. “So I figured something was better than nothing while making you breakfast.” She squeezes her chest as she says this sitting down, her cleavage spilling out over top the white fabric.<br />
<br />
You nod getting it and look to your side, watching the table disappear into the darkness.<br />
<br />
‘I think I know what this place is’ you say to her. She stops nibbling on toast to hear what you have to say.<br />
<br />
‘I believe, this is some kind of magical home for little girls. However it was shut down and recently it has begun to act on its own.’<br />
<br />
Your tiger loli girlfriend nods to you biting of a piece of toast and chewing it before swallowing it.<br />
<br />
“That would explain some stuff” she says “like the large bath, the weird room placement, and this massive table”<br />
<br />
“But what about US” she says gestureing to herself and you.<br />
<br />
You already had an answer for that ‘basically, what I’m guessing is that the building still wants to take care of people, but it can’t do everything. And only knows how to take care of little girls.’<br />
<br />
You remember the dust in the door nexus.<br />
<br />
‘I think it can do something’s but not others, like keep the water hot and clean in the Bath Room, and wash out clothes, but it can’t dust.’<br />
<br />
You wait for your loli tiger girlfriend/ Sister to finish her stack of pancakes before she asks the question you thought your self.<br />
<br />
“If that’s the case, then what do you think we should do here?”</p>
