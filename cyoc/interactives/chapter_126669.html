<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Good Ending</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony scanned Mike on the Chronivac<br />
<br />
Name: Mike Jones<br />
Altered Stats-<br />
Flaccid Length: 1&quot;<br />
Flaccid Girth: 2&quot;<br />
Erect Length: 2.5&quot;<br />
Erect Girth: 3&quot;<br />
Penis Sensitivity: Very High<br />
<br />
He stared at the screen for a moment before turning it off, putting away the Chronivac and going to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning the pair were awoken at dawn by Mike&#39;s alarm. Mikey subconsciously reached down to give his cock a rub but was confused when all he could feel was a bundle of cloth where his penis usually was to greet him. An intense arousal at the small bit of friction on his little stiff nub washed over him and brought him wide awake. The events of last night came flooding back to his mind and he sat up to see Tony slowly stirring to consciousness scratching his own new appendage. Mikey quickly scrambled to turn his alarm off but Tony was already up and stretching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Tony,&quot; Mikey apologized &quot;I usually get up early to work out, forgot to turn off my alarm&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem&quot; Tony said &quot;I wanted to get an early start today anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony hopped out of bed and started to change while Mikey stayed under the covers. Though Tony didn&#39;t flaunt his large manhood, Mikey could spot it dangling from behind between his legs. Mikey&#39;s little dick dripped onto his sheets while he waited for his room mate to leave so he could jerk off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to the dining hall&quot; Tony announced when he was finally dressed &quot;I&#39;ll catch you around&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as he closed the door behind him Micro Mikey gripped his little dick between his thumb and forefinger shooting a watery load all over himself in less than a minute. After a few moments of deep breathing he cleaned himself off, got changed and left the room.<br />
<br />
The next few weeks we&#39;re fairly normal. They attended classes, made new friends and were both generally well liked and anyone who saw them together in public thought they were old friends. Though every time they were alone in their dorm room the dynamic changed. Mikey would always do chores around the room and ask if Tony needed anything.<br />
<br />
At first Tony thought he was just trying to make amends but after a while he suspected maybe Mikey was starting to enjoy being submissive. Mikey didn&#39;t even notice it himself at first, but whenever Tony said he could use a glass of water or that he needed a book returned if Mikey was on his way past the library, his micropenis twitched. Though Tony assured him it was perfectly ok for him to masturbate any time he wanted, Micro Mikey was always embarrassed to rub his little dick with Tony in the room Sometimes he&#39;d go days without masturbating. One night he replayed the party in his head and dreamed of the humiliation he felt that night and the feeling of submission, he recalled rubbing his dicklet in front of everyone as their jeers and laughter rang through his head. The next morning he woke up with large wet spot, having ejaculated into his pants during the night. Tony of course noticed and told him he should jerk off more and insisted it was okay for him to masturbate around him. It took a few more days but one night when lying in bed he noticed Tony slowly pulling at his cock under his sheets. Mikey decided to go for it and gave his erect 2.5 inch cocklet a rub too.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it Mike&quot; Tony assured him &quot;See it&#39;s perfectly normal&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, yea your right Tony&quot; Mike moaned &quot;ummm... you can call me... Mikey...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok no problem Mikey&quot; Tony responded &quot;There&#39;s no need to be shy, you look close to cumming, pull back the sheets so you don&#39;t make a mess&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite Mikey&#39;s embarrassment, he trusted his room mate and did what he said. He exposed his little boner to Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me... Micro Mikey...if you want...&quot; Mikey suggested &quot;it&#39;s only fair... I called you T-tiny Tony for so long&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s okay Mikey I don&#39;t need to do that&quot; Tony reassured<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I need to make amends... it&#39;s only fair... you have to... please&quot; Mikey pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Tony remarked &quot;if you insist...Micro Mikey&quot;<br />
<br />
At the use of his new nickname Mikey moaned and released a droplet of precum from his micropenis<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep at it Micro Mikey&quot; encouraged Tony &quot;Just because you have a tiny dick now, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t enjoy it&quot;<br />
<br />
At the mention of the size of his dick, Micro Mikey let out a groan and had the most intense orgasm of his life. His little sprinkler sprayed a load all over his face, hair and chest. After he came down from his bliss he looked over at Tony who was still slowly stroking and smiling at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, you were right Tony.&quot; He panted &quot;Umm, you can get your cock out too. I don&#39;t mind seeing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then Mikey I will&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony revealed his large penis, over 9&quot; erect, while Mikey licked his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need any help?&quot; Mike asked<br />
<br />
&quot;No that&#39;s okay, I can handle it&quot; Tony responded smiling<br />
<br />
&quot;Please&quot; Mikey begged &quot;I feel bad for bullying you. I really want to make it up to you Tony. Please let me make it up to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well if you insist Mikey&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikey proceeded to pull on Tony&#39;s prodigious cock until he ejaculated all over his room mate&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
The next few years passed, the two remained room mates throughout college and even though Mikey had long since been forgiven, he was always did what he could to please Tony. Tony in return gave Mikey what he desired as he fell deeper into his need for small penis humiliation. Tony used him as fuck hole, while also giving Micro Mikey&#39;s tiny pecker the ridicule it craved. After graduation Tony offered to change Micro Mikey&#39;s penis back to normal but he refused. Mikey had grown accustomed to his nub dick and the feelings of inadequacy. They both went their separate ways but Mikey kept looking for new sources to humiliate and dominate him. Some were harsher than Tony, had bigger cocks or put him through worse humiliations. And though he had many new masters, every now and then he&#39;d feel the burning need to drop Tony a line, and beg his old room mate to give his micropenis the feeling of inferiority the way no one else could.</p>
