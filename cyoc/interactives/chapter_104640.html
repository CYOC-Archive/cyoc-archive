<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan ran out of the house into the barn to wash his own cum off of his face.  He made it to the shower before he started to cry uncontrollably.  Why were they so mean to him? What had he ever done to them?  That was it, they&#39;d crossed the line.  He looked at his backpack, and moved to pull the chronivac out before stopping.  It wasn&#39;t enough just to punish them, they had to know that he was the one who did it.  That they were getting what was coming to them after years of tormenting him  How was he going to do it though?  The two of them were too fast and strong for him. Once they figured out what was happening they&#39;d stop him, and then they&#39;d have the chronivac.  He could change them and then tell them he was the one who did it. However, that didn&#39;t seem as good as seeing the fear and confusion in their eyes as it was happening. He had to figure out a way to give himself an edge. As Ryan finished cleaning himself up an idea came to him. He looked in side pocket of his backpack and found $40 he&#39;d saved up over the year, closed grabbed his things, and started off into town.  <br />
<br />
It took Ryan the better part of 30 minutes to get to the liquor store.  He had never bought liquor before, he was nervous.  Ryan saw the twins friend at the register, but he couldn&#39;t remember the boys name.  He walked in and grabbed the first things he could see a 1.75 of cheap vodka, some sprite, and a 24 pack of cheap beer.  He sheepishly walked up to the register and placed the items and his money on the counter.  &quot;Mike and Aaron sent me to get this for them,&quot; Ryan mumbled working as hard he could to keep eye contact. &quot;Can I see your ID&quot; the kid shot back without looking up from his magazine.  Ryan muttered a little and pretended to check his pockets preparing to turn and run for it before the clerk laughed, &quot;That&#39;ll be, $40&quot; he snickered and pocketed Ryan&#39;s money.  Ryan put the liquor in his now bulging backpack and started to walk home.  <br />
<br />
Ryan got home and went up to the hayloft to hide the liquor.  He hungout up there for a few hours, to both form his plan and avoid his family.  The shame of what had happened earlier was still very fresh and Ryan worried that he wouldn&#39;t be able to play it cool if he saw them.  Ryan waited until he heard the dinner call before he headed down and into the house.  The conversation was sparse, Ryan worked hard to act as if nothing was wrong. He even made a few comments to the twins, to try to talk a little to them.  After dinner was over Ryan offered to and then cleared the table. He heard his father tell Mike and Aaron that they weren&#39;t going out tonight, apparently their punishment wasn&#39;t over.  This worked to Ryan&#39;s favor.  Ryan found the twins sulking upstairs.  &quot;Hey guys,&quot; Ryan was working hard on keeping his voice level and calm, &quot;I have something for you in the barn.&quot; The Mike looked over at him skeptically. &quot;Listen about earlier I was wrong to say what I did,&quot; Ryan continued, &quot;You two are just so cool and everyone likes you and I&#39;ve never really fit in.&quot; Now both of them were looking at him with confused looks on their faces. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have even been able to get the booze if it wasn&#39;t for you,&quot; Ryan was convinced that it wasn&#39;t working.  &quot;Booze?&quot; Aaron perked up. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryan smiled, &quot;I just want to be more like you and I thought you could help me out, so I bought booze and hid them in the hayloft.&quot;  &quot;Is that why you asked to go to the party last night?&quot; Mike asked. &quot;Yeah, exactly,&quot; Ryan hadn&#39;t thought of that but it worked with his lie, &quot;I finally started to grow a little downstairs and I got cocky. Maybe you guys could give me some pointers and I&#39;ll get you drunk.&quot;  The twins looked at each other and then back at Ryan with a &quot;sure&quot; in unison.  The three of them headed downstairs and out to the barn.<br />
<br />
When they got up to the loft, Ryan moved the hay bale that concealed his cache.  He lined up the three cups he&#39;d stashed up there, filling his mostly with sprite and theirs primarily with vodka.  Aaron took a sip and cringed, &quot;you made that a little strong, Ry.&quot; &quot;Ohh sorry,&quot; Ryan said with feigned sympathy, &quot;I figured you could handle it with all you drink and lift. I didn&#39;t want to disappoint you again.&quot; &quot;Ohh we can,&quot; Mike chirped in, &quot;good job.&quot;  Whenever their drinks got low, Ryan was quick to fill them again. He plied them with questions about what their lifting routine was and stories about their physical and sexual exploits.  They told him about the hours they&#39;d spent working out and relished explaining to him how he&#39;d wasted his time reading and doing homework. How he had to ditch his loser friends and start hanging out with cool people who&#39;d lift his reputation out of the gutter.  First though, he&#39;d have to start working out, no one wanted to be friends with a fat nerd, even if he did have a big sausage between his legs. <br />
<br />
They&#39;d finished the vodka and gotten pretty deep into the beer before Ryan felt safe springing his trap.  Aaron and Mike were slurring pretty hard and Ryan was trying his best to mimic them as not to let on he was for all intents and purposes sober.  &quot;yous gotta do wresttlng&quot; Mike was trying to instruct Ryan, &quot;ull get in shapes and all the grls will see you have a big penis.&quot; Ryan took this opportunity to start things off, &quot;I&#39;ve godda piss&quot; Ryan said stumbling away grabbing the backpack and moving into a dark corner of the loft where he was out of sight.  Before he took his revenge, Ryan had to make sure that if they tried to over power him, he&#39;d be able to fight them off.  He opened up the chronivac, &quot;Battery at 82%, Hello&quot; Ryan found himself on the map and started upgrading his muscles.  He made sure he could out bench, out curl, out squat his brothers and that only he and they were aware of the changes.  He was stronger and faster than them, with the muscles to prove it. To the rest of the world, Ryan will seem like he had always been that buff.  After the changes took hold, he decided to have a little fun before heading back to the boys. He clicked on Aaron and made a few changes so that he wouldn&#39;t be able to hold his bladder anymore, and he wouldn&#39;t be able to tell when he was peeing himself.  Ryan left the Chronivac running in his back pack and headed back to his brothers.  He found them each slamming another beer. Ryan didn&#39;t feel the need to put back on his act quite as thick.  &quot;So you guys think I should wrestle, huh&quot; he asked both of them, &quot;how about you guys show me some moves.&quot; Aaron and Mike didn&#39;t take any more than that to start circling each other and then work on pinning each other.  Aaron had gotten Mike down on all fours and was on his back trying to flip him over, when it happened. He didn&#39;t realize it, but Aaron had pissed himself and it had gotten all over Mike. &quot;ahh whad da fuck man&quot; Mike said feeling the wetness on his ass. &quot;Sorry dude&quot; Aaron sputtered &quot;didn&#39;t know iwaz peeing.&quot; Aaron stood up and was working on getting his clearly wet pants off, taking his underwear with them.  Mike was clearly mad and kicked his pants off too, &quot;dude, you got it went all the way through.&quot;  &quot;Juzst take&#39;em off,&quot; a stumbly and slurry Aaron ordered, taking his shirt off too, leaving him completely naked in the hayloft.  Mike was confused on how to proceed, but he wasn&#39;t one to leave Aaron flapping in the breeze so he followed instructions and got naked.  Ryan couldn&#39;t barely contained his smile, it was time.<br />
<br />
&quot;So who won the wrestling match?&quot; Ryan asked, &quot;did Mike forfeit or was Aaron disqualified for pissing?&quot; The twins both chose the options that suited them before continuing to wrestling. Aaron was back on top again his dick pressing up against Mike&#39;s ass.  Mike was working hard to get out of the hold.  Ryan took the opportunity to pull his backpack onto his lap and pull up Mike&#39;s stats. He decreased the muscle mass all over Mike&#39;s body and made it so like Aaron he couldn&#39;t control his bladder anymore. He shrank Mike&#39;s dick down so that it was half an inch short of an inch, and his balls were like BB&#39;s.  Furhter, Mike would cum on the slightest passing touch of his cock.  He set the change to take effect in two minutes, before pulling up Aaron&#39;s stats again.  Aaron had been the one who rubbed Ryan&#39;s face in it, he&#39;d pay the most.  Ryan decided that on top of losing all of his muscle, Aaron would lose his prick all together. Ryan adjusted Aaron to become female.  He set the timer so that Aaron would change at the same time as Mike.  The twins had stopped wrestling when they noticed Ryan playing on the Chronivac.  &quot;whaddar ya doing?&quot; Aaron asked. &quot;I&#39;m punishing you for what you did to me earlier, and for all the years leading up to it actually&quot; Ryan stated matter of factly as he watched the countdown.  &quot;What?&quot; Mike asked getting up and approaching Ryan when the changes began.  The twins felt the electric tingle surge through their bodies, they stared at each other immobilized as they lost their muscles, as their mighty dicks shrank down, as Aaron grew breast and a his dick became a vagina.  All as Ryan laughed.</p>
