<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what is for dinner?&quot; Henry Jenkins asked as Akane lead Jenny and the Jenkins family from the room they had spent the day in, largely watching television in to pass the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve had my personal staff prepare a warm and welcoming meal,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;complete with fish, rice, and some fresh fruit. Very good and very healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sushi?&quot; Harry asked sounding curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Akane answered, &quot;salmon... though if you are curious on traditional Japanese cuisine... I am more than willing to share.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Jenny spoke up. She was fine with cooked fish, though typically the fish she saw on the table in Alabama was usually catfish, but raw fish was another matter. Her new were stomach might be able to handle it, but that didn&#39;t mean that she liked it. Harry, thankfully didn&#39;t press the issue and kept a hand around her&#39;s.<br />
<br />
They walked along a narrow hallway to move toward the dining area. The walls were well cleaned and painted in soft and warm colors. There were a few framed pictures that were hung on the walls, largely of Akane and her children or her grandchildren and others that had come to America after the end of World War II. Some were newer color photos, though there were a few black and white photos as well. Harry and Jenny both glanced to them, and despite knowing some of the basics on Akane&#39;s past, they did see a happy family in them. Both of them then traded private glances and smiles, as once they got through their respective college courses, and likely med school for Jenny with a specialization in psychology, and had their own careers started, they would start their own family and it would be a happy one.<br />
<br />
They eventually came to a room  that was dominated by a long oval table, though of a fairly short stature. They would have to sit on the floor in order to eat at it, and the places were marked by soft velvet cushions rather than chairs. The places were also set with plates of steaming rice and baked salmon, which smelled delicious to Jenny&#39;s nose. There was a wedge of lemon next to the salmon fillet, which looked like it had also been breaded slightly as well. Next to the plates were small bowls with mixed pieces of sliced fruit and a wine glass that was actually full of cider, apple cider by its scent. In a way it looked rather fancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t have to go through so much effort for us,&quot; Lisa found herself speaking beside her husband as she looked at the meal that was layed out before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;events had forced you to leave your home for the day, and while I am partial to my own home, I do understand any person&#39;s wish to be in their own home. It is therefore proper that I do my best to make your stay comfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny said to her. On some level she agreed with Lisa Jenkins&#39; statement, but at the same time, she felt truly honored by all the kindness she had received in Moon Lake, and not just from Akane. William Anderson&#39;s offer to take on a sort of surrogate parental role should her parents reject her outright sat in the back of her mind, Harry&#39;s love for her, the Twists with their explanations and therapy, and not to mention nearly every were apologizing to her for Yvette Smith&#39;s actions. That was a level of kindness that Jenny had only really seen from her oldest brother and her sister in Alabama. Akane&#39;s efforts to protect her and her fiancee&#39;s family and offer them such a meal fit in with all that, and it felt good.<br />
<br />
Jenny then looked out to the far wall and noted the large sliding glass doors that gave a view of fairly exquisite looking garden. Many things weren&#39;t budding as the plants were actually getting ready for winter, but she figured that they would have to be beautiful to look at when they were in full bloom during the spring and summer. Harry&#39;s giving her hand a gentle squeeze alerted her to the fact that the others had moved to sit down. Lisa and Henry did fairly well. It wasn&#39;t easy, but they were seated with their legs folded on a pair of cushions.<br />
<br />
&quot;This actually looks kinda fun,&quot; Jenny found herself commenting as Harry helped her, &quot;sorta like camping out as a kid...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Except more formal,&quot; Harry chuckled to her as they sat down.<br />
<br />
Akane smiled as she sat down to Jenny&#39;s left and did so with some ease. She might be a two hundred fifteen year old widowed werefox, but she wasn&#39;t past the point where these things were beyond her capability. She sat in a position that looked more like she was kneeling with her legs under her and looked to her guests. Jenny and Harry seated side by side, with smiles to each other. Despite all the problems that Jennifer Harper&#39;s family presented, the love she had for Harry was obvious and was more than worth protecting. To Harry&#39;s right were his parents, who looked to the two young lovers with the same sense of pride that Akane remembered feeling when her children got married and again when some of her grandchildren got married.<br />
<br />
They settled into dinner and ate heartily. Their conversation was friendly as they avoided the issues related to Dieter Wilhelm&#39;s agent and Jenny&#39;s family and focused more cheerful matters. They talked on things that were more cheerful, complementing Akane on her family and the hope that Harry and Jenny would have a similar happy family in the future. The compliment greatly pleased Akane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Families are always good,&quot; Akane to Jenny with a warm smile, &quot;the size of your family will be up to you and Harry... and given your age, you have PLENTY of time to plan things out, but there is nothing quite like having and raising kits. There is a great deal of joy from that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Henry agreed, &quot;Lisa and I both had a great deal of joy in seeing our sons grow up to be fine men they are today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And our family will be just as grand and just as loving,&quot; Harry promised to Jenny with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
Jenny returned it with a nod. Her family would be loving. Her kits would grow up with parents that wouldn&#39;t try to dominate every aspect of their lives and would be reasonable with regard to discipline and they would grow up with the freedom to make their own choices, make friends, and find their own loves. And she hoped that her future would be very much like the photographs she&#39;d seen hanging on the walls of Akane&#39;s home of Akane&#39;s own family, happy and content.</p>
