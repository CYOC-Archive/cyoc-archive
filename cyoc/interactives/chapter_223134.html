<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Marine captain looked at the people gathered in the small room, almost all of them were armed and ready to go incase this whole thing went sideways, however only five people were truly important at the moment.<br />
<br />
It had been decided that a five-member team would leave the bunker and travel across the infected nation to hopefully find a way to New York City or as close as they could to get a blood sample from the 1st generation of furriers.<br />
<br />
There was really no way to know if a furry was among the 1st to be turned unless they told them, most furrys seemed to be able to talk and actually retain some if not all of their human traits and personality. If those infected had stayed scared civilians and the like then the military forces of the world would have won, but an overwhelming need to spread the virus and convert meant the virus spread extremely fast. <br />
<br />
Others seemed to almost give in totally to animal instincts and went “hunting” eating humans and other creatures as well, there was even some reports of furry on furry attacks near the end when humans became harder and harder to find.<br />
<br />
Still others seemed almost human in nature, they would actually apologize for infecting a person and would walk around wearing some form of clothing. There had been satellite photos of new towns making up of either a single type of furry or all types rising in the ruins of the old. They seemed to avoid advanced technology but medieval tech seemed about as high as they went on the last reports.<br />
<br />
“I would like to thank you all for doing this.” Started the Captain as he looked at the five people standing before him. <br />
<br />
The oldest one was one of his top sergeants, an no-nonsense marine of 40 would had been in the core since he was 18 and had turned down every promotion or attempt to get him to become an officer. He was a veteran of multiple wars and would be someone whom the captain would miss a lot but one he understood wanted to go on this mission.<br />
<br />
“Not a problem, sir.” Said Master Sargent Kenny Smith in a southern accent as he stood at prepared attention, his short black was now salted with grey and jet-black skin and muscular build made him look more at home in the inner cities like the streets of New Orleans where he had grown up.<br />
<br />
“It’s a risky mission, sir but we all know we have to do this.” Said the other marine, a thin man whom looked even thinner standing beside the Master Sargent. He had the look of a farm boy from somewhere in the Midwest and that would be correct. His deep blue eyes, however, seemed to take in everything. “Truth be told sir, as a sniper I would be better served outside then fighting indoors if the time comes.”<br />
<br />
“Which is why I am sending you, Corporal Anderson.” stated the captain, hopefully his skills as a sniper will help this group move across the land.<br />
<br />
“This is fucking a crazy plan but one we have to do.” said the other military member of the team, she was one whom the Captain was semi happy to get rid of. It wasn’t that she was a problem per say but she was an Airforce pilot who had been shoved into his command when the air force had basically been grounded by the number of aircraft, they were losing to flying furries. When F-22 raptors, the most dangerous fighter in history were having their wings torn off midflight by some eagle or hawk furries it was time limit the number of aircraft in the air. <br />
<br />
Since Pilot Susan Booker was Air Force and not marines or his navy medics she had a habit of not really meshing well with her fellow armed service members. Also since she was a pilot, she had limited combat training on the ground so while she was trained in military weapons some of the civilians in the bunker would be more helpful if furry reached them. Overall she was a thin women, a little bit on the short side with brown hair which she had grown out a bit. She was a good-looking women, but not the type to turn heads. <br />
<br />
“The plan is to go to a nearby airfield and with luck I will be able to get something able to fly and then you fly us across the nation.” Stated one of the two civilians in the team. Monica was a no nonsense women, who had a body which looked like she belonged on the cover of a fashion magazine. Instead of perfume and dresses she wore overalls which somehow still looked amazing on her and was more often than not covered with grease and motor oil in her long blonde hair. She was a top mechanic and was actually on vacation in California when the virus took out. However she grew up on Long Island in New York where her father owned an auto repair shop.<br />
<br />
The plan was simple, once transformed they would hopefully got to the airport and find a workable aircraft. After five years with no none furry flying in the sky they could hopefully fly across the nation without drawing the attention of the furries. Once in New York, Monica would know New York itself since she had lived there her whole life until she just happened to be on vacation when the outbreak happened.<br />
<br />
 The last member of the team was also a civilian, the Captain didn’t want to send this man because he was one of the few doctors…well medical student but everyone called him doctor that he had in the bunker. He had aided in research for the small group of researchers he had but he had delivered everyone of the babies born in the bunker. His thin lanky frame made him look like a nerd. His thick glasses only added to the look, however whenever someone had transformed their eye sight had become perfect or near enough that no one noticed. He was a rather quiet guy and he remained quiet now. His job was to get the sample and bring it back. Beside him on a bench were over the shoulder bags carrying some supplies, it had been confirmed multiple times that furries used items like bags to carry items more so when they didn’t wear cloths.<br />
<br />
“Can we get this over with?” inquired Dr. Robert Summer<br />
<br />
“Agreed.” confirmed Master Sargent Kenny Smith as all of them went into the separate “rooms” within the decontamination room. The “rooms” where nothing more then showers with currents separating multiple shower heads. Each of them removed their cloths and prepared themselves. <br />
<br />
“Ready, good luck and God speed.” Said the Captain as one by one a researcher came forward and injected them with the furry virus. <br />
<br />
“The transformation should only take a few minutes and while you will be a furry your mind should remain human.” Stated the researcher “This will allow you to go out unnoticed by those infected outside.”<br />
<br />
With the final injection, it became a waiting game for the five of them of what they would become.</p>
