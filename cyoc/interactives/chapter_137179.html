<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The lesbian couple had been out for a &#39;date&#39;, which meant the shy femme Kory was simply going along with whatever the more butch Betsy wanted to do.  Which was why they&#39;d found themselves downtown.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, baby,  wadda ya&#39; think of my new jacket?&quot;<br />
<br />
Betsy gripped the front of her black leather jacket, with a sassy grin. She was dressed in ripped blue jeans and battered old sneakers. Her buzzed cut black hair was styled in a masculine way, even as the piercings in her brow, nose and lip flashed in the afternoon sun.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I think it looks great on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The green sundress-clad Kory smiled sweetly as she tucked a stray lock of her long blonde hair behind her ear. She might&#39;ve continued her shyness, but the pair was interrupted by the sudden appearance of a rough looking man from a nearby alley.<br />
<br />
He barreled past the two women, snatching Kory&#39;s purse in the process. This led to Betsy dashing off to chase after him, leaving her femme partner behind.<br />
<br />
But her encounter with Officer Rodd is a different tale.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Erik&#39;s heart was pounding as he tried to shake the bitch on his tail. He&#39;d ditched that cop easy enough, but getting away from this lady was proving to be harder. <br />
<br />
But he caught a break, thanks to s convenient dumpster. Using it as cover, he stopped and lay in wait. As Betsy came running up and past him, the crook blindsided her and knocked her down hard with a shoulder bump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Serves ya&#39; right, ya&#39; dykey bitch. &quot;<br />
<br />
He then ran off, leaving the fallen lesbian to pick herself up. Painfully, she got back to her feet, and started chasing him again. Betsy was now mad as hell. She couldn&#39;t let a dumb breeder like him get away with that and she sure as hell wasn&#39;t gonna let her babe Kory  down. <br />
<br />
But that last thought of her sexy girlfriend was her real downfall as the curse that Erik&#39;s homophobic insult had passed to her seized upon it to begin her transformation into someone else...<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
As she ran, the tattered jeans on her legs began to repair themselves, even as the faded blue darkened to black. The denim softened into regular cotton as the two tubes fused into one, and began sliding upwards to reveal her now longer and smooth legs. Her white socks shot up, the material thinning into sheer stockings that hooked up to garter straps just under her new skirt. A general rounding of her ass pulled the new skirt tight.<br />
<br />
Betsy was feeling strange now, as her mind began to grow foggy. Her need to keep chasing the perp remained strong, but the reasons why had now become fuzzy.  Was it her job? She shook her head, not seeing that her buzzcut was beginning to grow out, dark hair giving way to golden blonde.<br />
<br />
Her leather jacket had been creaking the whole time but that grew louder as it began to rip apart at the seams. The sleeves wrapped themselves around her waist, becoming a thick black leather belt. Other portions became various pouches that attached to the belt. Soon enough, a holster formed on her right hip with the grip of a gun poking out while a thick nightstick dropped into place on her left.<br />
<br />
The chase finally got back on streets, with Betsy starting to make up some ground on Erik. However, so too was her transformation. Her black t-shirt was starting to flutter as she ran, the sleeves lengthening down her now toned arms. Buttons appears at the wrists and clasped closed. Matching buttons popped into place down the front, with pockets wrenching into place over each of her breasts, and a stiff collar unfolding around her neck.<br />
<br />
Underneath the developing blouse, her wifebeater was twisted into a white silk wire bra that soon filled with the growing flesh of her swelling tits. Her breasts&#39; surge forward threw Betsy off balance,  causing her long blonde mane to block her vision for a moment, all allowing her perp to get further ahead again.<br />
<br />
Perp? Was she a cop? Her memories seemed to think so, as her time at the academy supplanted recollections of college.  And soon there was something else she could dimly recall now. Or rather someone whose importance loomed larger by the moment.<br />
<br />
Her pursuit continued as muscle memory kept her in hot pursuit. The tangle of hair which had blinded her was now pulled back into a bun by unseen hands. But her now revealed face had changed. Higher cheekbones, and a strong jaw dominated her features, soon joined by lips that plumped up into a slight pout. Her eyes were changed as well, the brown being washed away into a dazzling blue. <br />
<br />
Her long-nailed hand reached up to grasp a radio that now hung over her right breast. As she clicked it on, there was a flow of metal down from her face, a portion of the mass that had once been numerous facial piercings. A glob settled in place on her left breast, flattening out into a shiny police shield. Another blob formed into a metal name tag engraved with the name &#39;B. Burlington&#39;.<br />
<br />
As soon as the name tag formed, a very mentally weakened Betsy was flooded with memories of another life. One of being a wife with a loving husband. This thought which would have horrified her not ao long ago now seemed comforting to her, her attraction to women having shriveled away to nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;L...Lieu... Lieutenant Bet..Becky B...Burlington here. I am in pursuit of a purse snatcher, and backup is requested.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she waited for a response, the last bits of metal formed into a pair of mirror shades that covered her eyes, and hid the crows&#39; feet that now framed them. She was starting to feel her years, even though she had the body of a woman almost half her age. But just then a deep masculine voice crackled over her radio...<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the Chief. I&#39;m heading your way, Lt. Becky...I mean Burlington.&quot;<br />
<br />
The veteran policewoman allowed herself a smile at her loving husband&#39;s protocol failure. He sometimes forgot to be formal on the job, but that&#39;s why she loved him. A wedding band with a black diamond formed around her ring finger as memories of their life and family together snapped into place, burying the lesbian Betsy deep in her subconscious.<br />
<br />
With her Chief on his way, this perp didn&#39;t stand a chance. She pulled down the officer&#39;s cap that now rested on her head. <br />
======<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kory was about to encounter Officer Rodd. Was she too about to get cursed?</p>
