<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lesily looked to the board to see what the audience want.  Seeing the animated display, she could see that there&#39;s a father, older brother, and younger brother on the screen with the title.<br />
<br />
Transfer Damein and Derrek&#39;s years into Dex<br />
Dex: Father (36)<br />
Damien: Older Brother (6)<br />
Derrick: Younger Brother (6)<br />
<br />
Looking to the display, she could tell what the crowd wants. &quot;Huh...  That&#39;s interesting.  You want me to trade some years out of Derrick and Damien into Dex and turning Dex into a father.  That would be something.  Let&#39;s give that a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising the crystal over the three brothers and told the younger twins, &quot;Derrick, Damien, I am going to remove 6 years out of both your bodies to transfer over to Dex here.  From there, you both will become a younger brothers while Dex becomes a father.  You both will see Dex as the father with a stronger bond and will have a stronger connection as brothers and not take different paths.  You two understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins nodded in unison and said at the same time.  &quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon pointed the crystal to Dex and told him, &quot;Dex, I&#39;m going to transfer 6 years of Damien and Derrek into you and you will age up into a father of 36.  From there, you won&#39;t consider as an older brother, but instead a father of two six year old twins and will behave like a father raising the twins at the best of your abilities.  You will love and cherish them and will do anything to give them a bright future.  You understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dex nodded as well and responded with, &quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily smiled and said, &quot;Good.  Now Damien, Derrick, go between Dex so we can begin the transfer.&quot; the two brothers soon split and went to both sides of Dex, having them all lined up neatly together.  Once they were set up, Lesily instructed them on what to do.  &quot;Now close your eyes...&quot;  The three bothers closed their eyes.  &quot;Damien and Derrick, let 6 years of your lives melt off your body, become younger and closer together as brothers.  Dex, let 12 years of your brothers flow into you and grow to become the father of the twins.  Become a close knit family, become a happy family...  Be a family...&quot;<br />
<br />
Saying those words, the twins felt a chill in their bodies as Dex felt a glowing warmth in his.  It was then the transfer has started as the twins years were being removed from them while getting added into Dex.<br />
<br />
The twins body soon started to dwindle down through their preteens as their bodies grew smaller and living through a serious shrink spurt while their traits were being washed away.  Damien&#39;s body lost the toned muscles and he was thin while his bald head exploded in Sandy brown locks that was restyling into a slick back bob cut.  With derrick, the bruises and scar faded away while the temporary tattoos disappeared on his arm.  The busted lip and black eyed healed up quickly with the shaggy hair shrank and restyled into the same do as his twin.  Both their penises and balls shrunk and shriveled into its prepubescent state and looked miniscule and childlike with their small Adams apples popped into their necks.  re-entering their single digits they were smaller and lankier with rips showing on their mid sections and their compressing arms and legs were boney.  Their faces started to look more childish as their noses were getting smaller and cheeks were a little puffy.  Nearing six, early signs of baby fat were growing on their shrinking appendages while bellies protruded out of their midsections.  By the time they reached six, they were two identical twins filled with childish innocence and wonder.<br />
<br />
For Dex though, the six years between the twins were transferring into him as he was starting to age.  Going into his thirties, he left college and was starting his career.  He grew taller and gained a bit of muscle tone, not much as the previous dan, but enough to make him look good.  A light dusting of hair spread across his face as light traces of body hair grew on his arms and legs with a small tuft of chest hair appeared in the middle of his chest and a treasure trail spreading across his torso.  Even his privates were increasing from the twins own as the balls inflated and descended downward while his rod grew longer and meatier.  On the surface, he looked like a regular grown man who is well endowed.  However, when he was goring through is thirties, that&#39;s when he hit his Prime and slowly descended in age.  His body was starting to show a bit of wear and tear as his toned arms and legs gaining a bit of fat as a slight beer gut popped out of his mid section.  His body hair was more denser then before as the penis and balls were twice the size as before.  His facial hair grew and covered his face, trimming into a fine looking beard with faint lines appeared on around his eyes and mouth as slight dark circles appeared over his eyes as proof of raising twins.  His dark brown hair was gaining a beach erosion on the sides and was slicked back with a bald spot appearing at the back of his head.  As he hit 36, Dex was no longer a young college student, but instead a father of twins.<br />
<br />
As the changes were done, Lesily was pleased with the results.  &quot;All right you three, open your eyes.&quot;  The three opened their eyes and were still in a trance.  &quot;Now tell us who you three are.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that they re-introduced themselves as Damien started with a youthful and childish voice, &quot;I&#39;m Damien, I&#39;m the twin brother of Derrek!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrek did the same with the same voice and attitude.  &quot;I&#39;m Derrek, I&#39;m the twin brother of Damien!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dex soon responded mature and manly voice, &quot;And I&#39;m Dexter, I&#39;m the father of Damien and Derrek.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily could see that the mental and bonding changes kicked in and decided to ask a few questions.  &quot;Now Derrek and Damien, how much do you care for each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damien started with, &quot;Oh, I love my brother.  He&#39;s so cool and laid back, always loves to do things his way.  He&#39;s the best brother I could ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here.&quot; Derrek continued, &quot;I love my bro too.  He&#39;s so strong and protective, always looks out for me no matter what.  He&#39;s so cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you think of your father, Dexter?  Do you like him as well.&quot;  Lesily asked them.<br />
<br />
Both boys soon said in unison, &quot;Dad&#39;s the best!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s so big!&quot; Damien started.<br />
<br />
&quot;And confident!&quot; Derrek responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smart!&quot; Damien returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caring!&quot; Derreck rebutted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we love him so much!&quot; They finished together.<br />
<br />
Lesily looked at the two and smiled warmly.  Looking up to a hypnotic dad, she told him, &quot;And what of you, Dexter.  How are you able to raise twins on your own.  That&#39;s quite the hands full.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dexter nodded and said in a trance, &quot;You have no idea.  Ever since my wife died after giving birth, it was my responsibility in looking after them.  Honestly, the first few years were rough, but I believe we are gelling pretty well.  Though I fear what would happen when they are at their teens.  I could only imagine how they will end up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lesily remembered what they looked like in their preteens and when they were both once Dan.  She just hope that they would be raised properly.  Turning to the audience, she told everyone, &quot;And there you have it.  Dave, the once father to an entire family, becomes a father with twins.  You people really know how to make the show memorable.&quot;<br />
<br />
The audience applaud as they were entertained by what Dave became.  Gloria, despite upset that she won&#39;t get her hands on Dan, looked to Dexter&#39;s junk and licked her lips, wondering if she can ride that pogo stick.<br />
<br />
Lesily soon told the audience, &quot;So what now, my friends.  Should we continue with these three, or move on to the rest of the family on the other side.  You know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd voted once more as Lesily wait to see what they want to see next.</p>
