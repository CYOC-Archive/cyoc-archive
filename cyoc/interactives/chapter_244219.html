<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff watched angrily as his mother left with his friend, going out to have a fun day, leaving him to do all the household chores in a female body... ugh! The gender swap along with a role reversal was a bit much, but its not like there isn&#39;t plenty to do...<br />
<br />
Jeff began by tending to his mom&#39;s garden since it was still early and the day was going to be hot. Weeding followed by watering. Jeff didn&#39;t like having a woman&#39;s body but was able to make do. Mandy awoke a little later, and Isabelle went back inside preparing some hot oatmeal with granola and some freshly sliced apple and nectarine for the two of them.<br />
<br />
Falling into the role more deeply and it being Sunday, Isabelle asked about lingering homework assignments for tomorrow and started prattling off chores that need to be done, &quot;You need to clean your toys, and I plan on doing some laundry so you&#39;ll need to put your clothes away, and don&#39;t forget to take a shower and wash your hair for school tomorrow. I can help with a bath if you need too so let me know&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mommy&quot; was the young child&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Hurry up sweetie, I called your from Harriet&#39;s mom To play, its father&#39;s day and I was hoping to clear you girls out to give him some peace and quiet today. Your sister&#39;s already out with a friend till at least this afternoon. If your friend isn&#39;t available and you can&#39;t find anything else to do, tell your sister to swing by and you can tag along with her. I think she&#39;s headed to the mall.&quot; Isabelle cleared the dishes, collected some laundry and began a load of wash.<br />
<br />
Over the next hour Mandy vacated the house as quickly as possible to escape the list of chores her mother began piling on and Isabelle began a pot of coffee along with eggs, fruit, and pancakes for her husband/former father. With each chore completed, each family need considered, each motherly or wifely duty contemplated, Jeff&#39;s mind fell further and further into the background repressed by the foreign thought patterns. Isabelle felt her body was feeling particularly ungainly today but chalked it up to possibly gaining a few extra pounds recently and committed herself to doing a load of laundry every day to get more steps in...<br />
<br />
The house being empty but for her and her sleeping husband, she quietly entered the bedroom and set the breakfast in bed she brought on her nightstand. Going over to Mike, her husband, she gently began kissing and caressing him, wishing him a happy fathers&#39; day as his eyes fluttered open. Isabelle was pulled onto the bed, and the pair cuddled and kissed.<br />
<br />
Isabelle&#39;s tender caresses went under the covers and into Mike&#39;s underwear, already aroused from morning wood, Mike quickly got off and stifled his yell by putting a pillow over his head, making Isabella giggle.<br />
<br />
Gazing lovingly into her husband&#39;s eye&#39;s, &quot;I brought you breakfast, the kids are out of the house, the day is yours to do whatever you want.&quot; She rolled off the bed and went into the master bathroom rinsing the semen off of her. returning, she handed him the plate of food she prepared and laid next to him as he ate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you babe, thanks.&quot; Mike said taking the plate and diving in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you happy?&quot; Isabelle asked realizing she couldn&#39;t remember the last time she checked in with her husband.<br />
&quot;Breakfast is delicious, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, I meant, are you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love our family, we have a good life.&quot; Mike looked over, swallowed his bite of food, smiled and kissed her on the forehead.<br />
<br />
Isabella&#39;s womanly intuition kicked in. &quot;But, are you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike rolled his eyes, and smirked, &quot;I can&#39;t get anything past you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...nope so you shouldn&#39;t even try mister!...&quot; Isabella cut in poking Mike&#39;s side playfully.<br />
<br />
Mike turned thoughtful, &quot;I had always hoped for a son, but money was much tighter 16-18 years ago after Jessica was born And Megan Was An Accident Which Drained Funds Even More. I also imagined I&#39;d be manlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Manlier?&quot; Isabelle gave Mike&#39;s penis a playful squeeze eliciting a shocked yelp and a jump. &quot;How much manlier can you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike blushed, &quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m being ridiculous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabella realized he took that as dismissal of his feelings, &quot;No, I mean it. I don&#39;t understand what you feel you&#39;re missing out on, and you can&#39;t tell me you&#39;re happy, so I want to know. If its important to you, its important to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;m just letting go of hopes I had. I imagined my son looking up to me, seeking guidance in the garage. Sharing his first beer with him. Having a cigar with him at his wedding and eventual baby shower, watching sports together...&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabelle was completely confused. &quot;What? You don&#39;t smoke, you hate the garage, and you dislike sports. You don&#39;t even like beer, you tolerate it if you have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike chuckled, &quot;Right! And those are manly bonding experiences I feel I&#39;m missing out on. Its not like Jessica or Megan would value those experiences with me, and its not like I didn&#39;t enjoy having my nails done...&quot; The pair looked at each other and laughed recalling the day a 5 year old Megan demanded makeovers for everyone including dad. &quot;... but its different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabelle pondered, &quot;There&#39;s still a chance through a son-in-law, if Jessica or Megan marry a nice man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike nodded, &quot;Yeah, some of that might be possible, but by that time he probably did that with his dad, or male relative, or friend group... <br />
But you&#39;re right, I still have a chance.&quot; Mike giggled, &quot;I guess part of me just wishes I embodied the aesthetic better and could pass that on, you know... Muscular without working out, grow a beard a day, grilling large quantities of meat while drinking beer and smoking a cigar. Its a stupid, unhealthy ideal to want, but that doesn&#39;t make me want it less.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabelle was bemused, &quot;Pass it on? So one of our girls marries a nice boy. You and him go camping over the weekend and when you come stumbling back, each of you are covered in rippling muscles and body hair, with big shaggy beards, carrying smoked meats, clinking beers and smoking cigars... that&#39;s the general idea of something that would make you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike blushed, &quot;Well that&#39;s the hunting trip scenario, but yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabelle laughed as she rolled her eyes, &quot;Oh my god you&#39;ve NAMED it! Men are so weird!&quot; She rolled off the bed.<br />
<br />
Mike balked, &quot;I named an excursion event and you think that&#39;s weird, but every stuffed animal in our daughters&#39; rooms have names and that&#39;s okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Isabelle fake glared at Mike, &quot;This has nothing to do with Mr. Snugglebottoms, stop trying to change the subject!&quot;<br />
Mike, matching Isabelle&#39;s energy, rolled out of bed himself lobbing a pillow at her with a chuckle, &quot;Dear lord, Mr. Snugglebottoms! You think he&#39;d like to go on a guys hunting trip with me? Mono y mono? We can smear mud in our armpits as deodorant, piss wherever the mood strikes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Preposterous! Mr. Snugglebottoms is a refined gentlemen, not some savage brute like yourself! And you&#39;ve never been hunting.&quot;<br />
Mike grunted aggressively in response and gave chase, Isabelle squeaked, ran out of the room giggling as she closed the door behind her.</p>
