<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Disclaimer: This story branch takes material from the &quot;What Happened That Night&quot; and the &quot;Thy True Self&quot; options by The 1. The reason for this adaption is because I feel placing these options here will leave the story line more open for other writers to add on to. I mean no disrespect to The 1 and what he or she is trying to accomplish. I am also not trying to discourage people from adding on to other people&#39;s story lines. Original material will be added make the story more streamlined. I&#39;m just taking the best of everyone&#39;s worlds and and putting it together into one streamline storyline.  <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Juile Mike was getting ready for bed when she thought about what happened today.<br />
<br />
It started when Sarah mentioned that Jen wasn&#39;t around when she called her to pick her up in the morning. The East Hampton Cheerleaders just wasn&#39;t complete without their &quot;Star&quot;. Juile is the captain of the cheerleader squad so it is her duty to make sure every member of the squad do their job.They have a major game tomorrow so no amount of skipping class will excuse missing the game. So as the &quot;Ringleader&quot;, Juile must find their missing comrade. All the members of the members of the squad must attend school in order to keep up their reputation as East Hampton&#39;s Best of the Best. No exceptions. <br />
<br />
So to began her investigation, she began asking around school on the whereabouts on their missing cheerleader. Ever since Jen disappeared, that freshman, Kyle Perkins was the only one who acted suspicious at the mention of Jenifer. So they did what any normal cheerleader squad would do and started taking his cloths off one at a time while filming him on their phones. They threaten to post the videos online unless he tells them what he did to Jenifer. Eventually, he started spouting nonsense about the town curse, changing reality and how they aren&#39;t supposed to remember Jenifer as part of the cheerleader squad anymore. Of course, Julie called bull on that lie. Everyone knows the town curse is just some kind of hoax to give people a excuse to do prank calls.<br />
<br />
Taking away Kyle&#39;s cloths was a prank to save face. After all, he&#39;s claiming to have made one of their own disappear.<br />
<br />
After school, Juile made a trip to Jen&#39;s house to confirm whether or not Jen wasn&#39;t just skipping out on school because she couldn&#39;t find the right sock. When she interviewed Jen&#39;s family, she was shocked to find out that none of them seem to remember that Jen even existed. It was just like Kyle said. Not even Martha the Housemaid, who was attending her ill son at the hospital doesn&#39;t remember who Jen is. Is the town curse real?... No. There has to be another reason other then &quot;magic&quot;. Whatever it was, Juile just got involved in either the town&#39;s biggest joke, or she just got  in on something very serous.<br />
<br />
Juile looked at her phone clock. It&#39;s almost midnight. She been investigating Jen&#39;s disappearance all day.<br />
<br />
The &quot;ringleader of the cheerleader squad&quot; let out a yawn. She still has time before the game tomorrow night. She&#39;ll just keep looking for Jen tomorrow. She just hope this whole thing isn&#39;t as serious as she suspect.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Samual Mike couldn&#39;t sleep. Even though there are comfortable blankets covering the splintery floor boards, He can&#39;t even close his eyes. Samual spent his life sleeping on the dirt and he rather keep doing that. So why is he sleeping on the second floor of the house tonight?<br />
<br />
For most of his earlier life, he&#39;s been living without a home, stealing food and running away from other people. The only thing he knows is that his name is Samual Mike. But who give him this stupid name and why does he know it? Come to think of it, when did he learn English? His first memories was stumbling through the forest outside of town. Did he forget something?<br />
<br />
For years, Samual has grew more trusting to animals then Humans. People just think they own the world. At least the woodland animals doesn&#39;t care when he takes food from the forest. The towns people tries to arrest him whenever he tries to take food from the super market.<br />
<br />
 Luckily for Samual, he managed to find this abounded house on the outskirts of town. He spent his entire life alone, living in this abounded house ever since. The trees provided him with all the food he needs and the creek behind the house provided him with the water. <br />
<br />
So why did he open up to Jen so easily?  Here he is, taking care of this young chimera boy when he decided long ago that he doesn&#39;t trust other people. So why did he even let him take his sleeping spot? Maybe its because Jen is more animal then human. Samual did find animals more trusting than humans. Even if he is human himself....<br />
<br />
For some reason, Jen just feels like a little brother to Samual, which is strange, saying that he never had a sibling before...<br />
<br />
Eventually, his eyes drifted close as he fell into the dark abyss of sleep.<br />
...<br />
<br />
Jenifer was slithering through the forest, walking on her two front wings. The monster is hunting for it&#39;s prey.<br />
<br />
That is when it found a wounded 5-year old girl who look a lot like Jen...<br />
<br />
But the monster didn&#39;t think like that, It only cared about mating and surviving. So it raped the human first, then it ate her. The human was food and a sex toy and nothing else...<br />
<br />
But the monster was still hungry...<br />
<br />
So it began chomping down on a tree with its monstrous chimera beaver teeth.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Jen was squirming about in her sleep. Needless to say, she was having a strange dream. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
The Beast continued prowling the forest. Still raping and eating and doing monster things. It even ate a police car along with the people inside it. However, the more it prows, the less monster type things it did. It started with killing and raping its prey, to just mauling them, to out right ignoring the prey entirely. It&#39;s not because its full. It will always be starving. It is a mindless beast after all. Then what is this wetness around its eyes?<br />
<br />
Soon, it came upon two humans. A teenage boy and a teenage girl. It appears the human girl is pulling the human boy&#39;s pants off. But why would the beast knows that the girl is pantsing the boy? It should only know monster things.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when a strange voice sounded in it&#39;s head. &quot;This girl is humiliating the boy for no reason. I have the power to transform one of them into a monster like you. Which one should it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
Why should the monster care? If anything, it will get a mate if it answers &#39;yes&#39;. But before it gave its answer, it realized it can&#39;t talk. It can&#39;t say &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39;. But wait... Why can it understand this strange language anyways? It&#39;s a mindless beast. Nothing more...so why is it crying? Why is it missing its parents so much..... Why is it/she caring... It&#39;s suppose to be mindless...<br />
<br />
In an instant, Jen&#39;s identity as a monster shattered, and in its place was the persona of Jen&#39;s TRUE human self. That includes Jen&#39;s original preference as a female.<br />
<br />
.....No. This isn&#39;t right. Losing someone&#39;s humanity, life and memories is a bad thing. No one should have their identity taken from them. Everyone except for her... If anyone should be a monster, it should be herself. She was given amazing things no one else had, she had a fancy house, fancy cloths, a house maid and she used her semi wealthy life to hurt others who don&#39;t have fancy things.<br />
<br />
If anyone deserves to lose their humanity, it&#39;s her and her alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who should it be?&quot; The voice repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me.&quot; Jen said quietly.<br />
<br />
In a dream space like this, even memories blocked away by the curse can be remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle is the reason why you are in the state you are now. Don&#39;t you want to give him the same curse to get even with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen was quiet. That is until she realize the dream changed and she is now in her original human form, with tears trailing down her face. &quot;Kyle had the right to curse me. All my life, I have been abusing the privileges given to me. I don&#39;t know what he was going through before I helped my friends prank him but if he felt the need to make someone pay, then I probably deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice sighed. &quot;Very well&quot;<br />
<br />
The next thing Jen knew, her remaining human parts became random animal parts. The transformation was long, very painful, and she was screaming in pain during the whole process. When it was time for Jen&#39;s human brain to transform, she painfully blacked out. What was left was not Jen, but a complete animal with no trace of human left.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The next thing she knew, she was in a black void witnessing memories of a life as a animal. But it might as well be like looking through the eyes of someone else. The things animal Jen did were horrible. First, animal Jen killed Samual in his sleep. The it started rampaging through town, killing Kyle, Juile and her fellow cheerleaders, then Jen&#39;s parents...<br />
<br />
Things got worse from there. She began going around town killing and raping anything and anyone, infecting people with her pollen and turning them into chimera monsters like herself.<br />
<br />
Eventually she was captured by the government and experimented on until she died.<br />
<br />
In the black void, Human Jen was screaming. This is not what she wanted. She only want herself to suffer. Not everyone else. Suddenly, she was in the dream forest again. But instead of dream Jen and dream Kyle standing in front of her, a smiling girl in a white robe was standing in their place. Even though Jen can only see her mouth, she can tell she was gorgeous. Maybe even more beautiful then herself. She can also tell that the girl was about the same age as Jen. That&#39;s when she spoke...<br />
<br />
&quot;You passed the test.&quot; The white robed girl congratulated.<br />
<br />
Jen was confused. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl took a deep breath. &quot;I was once a girl like you. That was until I was cursed to be a curse. An idea. An figment. A rumor. You may know me as the town curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
As weird as this dream was, Jen quickly made the connection that this girl is somehow the spirit of the Transform of Dare curse.<br />
<br />
Just to be sure she ask the dream girl if she really is what she suspected her to be. The girl simply nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. For the many years, I have only been only a thought. A curse. I am only allowed to speak to those on the borderline between their original selves and the being they are cursed to be. I speak to people through their dreams because the dream world shows their truest form of spirit and soul. In my many years of lost humanity, victims of the town curse usually summit to their sexual desires and ask to stay as they are permanently. I then lock them in their form. On rare occasions, people would chose to go back to their human forms. I therefore take the curse away from them. This is the test of humanity and I only give it to those I chosen specifically. Those who show signs of changing for the better or for the worse. Victims and users of the curse alike are only as human as they want to be. YOU however, are one of the very few who took the middle route. You have your flaws and in no way completely innocent. You choose to keep the curse in order to prevent others from enduring your pain. However, you also choose to give up your humanity, which would done the exact opposite from what you desire. That choice shows that you are naive and arrogant, but it also shows your kindness.&quot;<br />
<br />
The white hooded girl hugged Jen. Jen, who is still processing this information, chose not resist the embrace. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault that you were born in a better position in life then others. And even tough you abused what was given to you, you sincerely wish to correct that mistake now, which is something not everyone is willing to do&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope bloomed in Jen&#39;s heart. &quot;Does this mean you will turn me back into a human?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pale girl gave out a chuckle. &quot;No. I did say you took the middle road didn&#39;t I. When I asked you if you want your curse taken away, you declined. You can keep your humanity and identity, but that&#39;s it.&quot; Jen began sobbing even more then before.&quot;With that said... unlike some people I met.... I can tell you don&#39;t want to summit to your desire and truly become a beast. You just want to make up for the people you harmed over the years. I can respect that at least... but before I explain the results of your decision, I think it is time for me to introduce myself.&quot; Jen wiped away her tears.<br />
<br />
The girl released her embrace. &quot;My name is Echo the Mage, and when you wake up, you will have the chance to choose between a life as a human, an anthro chimera, or a true animal. This is possible due to your partial control over your form. Before we continue, I should say your control was not intended when Kyle stated the terms of your curse. Lying randomly changes your body as stated, and you forgot that Kyle cursed you, but that is all that really came true. For some reason beyond my understanding, Kyle&#39;s curse was really weak (and not very well worded) compared to the other curses people used me to create. Your &#39;friends&#39; from the cheerleader squad still remember you as a complete human. (Echo knows that not all the cheerleaders consider Jen as a &#39;friend&#39; even though Jen herself hasn&#39;t realized that yet) This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen with the town curse, &quot;I&quot; was suppose to automatically rewrite reality so they treat your current form like you were born like that. But for some reason, they remember you from before you were cursed. And to top things off, you were supposed to get animal parts. Not inanimate parts like your vacuum cock. I can&#39;t tell what kind of changes you might get at this point. You might get a ass for a hand if you don&#39;t stop lying.Your body parts might even be interchangeable at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen blushed at the mention of his/her cock from earlier. Her inactive vacuum cock grew into existence on her human dream body. She/he began stroking her cock. Jen grunted as she felt more animal parts growing on her dream body.<br />
<br />
Echo looked in concern. &quot;Stop stroking your cock. The more you summit to your sexual desires, the less chances there is of ever being human in real life again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen quickly dismissed any lustful animal thoughts as her animal parts disappeared from her dream body. As her human body returned, Jen asked questions that has been bothering her for awhile. &quot;Why are you so friendly to me? Why are you telling me any of this. Why are you helping me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Echo simply smiled. &quot;I been watching you since you&#39;ve been cursed. That includes reading your thoughts. I have hopes that you will be one of the few that can break the curse&#39;s hold on you. &#39;My&#39; hold on you is already very weak so it is a miracle that I am even able to talk to you so clearly in your dream.&quot; Echo paused for a moment... &quot;Also... It&#39;s been a long time since I had a proper conversation with anyone. The curse usually just forces me to test an chosen individual then disappear from their dream. I&#39;m only allowed to talk to others just to test them. The only reason I can talk to you after the test is probably because of your weak connection to the curse...&quot;<br />
<br />
The forested area around the duo faded to black. &quot;Your dream is going to be ending soon. Let me say as much as I can before it ends. We can talk later when you sleep again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded in understanding.<br />
<br />
Echo continued.&quot;I don&#39;t fully understand why your curse is so unstable, but I think it has something to do with your emotional state. When you believed you were a monster, you had no control over your curse, thus your body began changing randomly and looking more and more beastly as you kept lying. However, when you wanted your vacuum cock to be quiet, it silenced itself for you. In addition, your ears became more flower like to appease to your desire to have a worse, more desirable sense of hearing. Even more so, when you decided to view your self as a chimera, you grew more relaxed. Even more so, when you started to view yourself as a guy, your body took a more masculine appearance. Enough to make you look and feel like an actual guy. Even more so, your mental state is very close to when you were 5 years old. Hence the age change. What I&#39;m trying to say, is that your emotional state and how you view yourself help dictates what your body&#39;s appearance would be to match your spirit and soul. If you view yourself as a monstrous beast, you lose your humanity more and more. When you view certain aspects of yourself as human, the more human like they will become. For example, if you view your bat wings as human hands, the more hand like they will become. But if you continue to view yourself as a chimera, the longer you stay as a cross between human and animal. Your emotional and mental state also partially controls the reality around you. Your cheerleader friends still remember you as a human cheerleader because of your desire for a life as a cheerleader. However, I&#39;m going to let you decide what life you take. This situation is getting exiting. Even for me. Basically; You Choose Your Own Change (TM).&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though a lot of things makes sense to Jen now, she still had questions. Like this for example. &quot;Why you speak so formally. You&#39;re using words like &quot;therefore&quot;, &quot;However&quot; and &quot;In addition&quot; and maybe even &quot;thus&quot;. Did you rehearsed or written down this speech or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The white robed girl who looks like she belongs to Assassins Creed(TM) laughed wholeheartedly. &quot;When you have as much alone time as I have, you began to think about what you say first. I probably over did it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Echo&#39;s body began fade to black with the rest of the dreamscape. Jen stood in total darkness as she continues to hear Echo&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m running out of time. Even though you can talk to me freely when you&#39;re asleep, eventually our bond will grow stronger and you will be able to talk to and see me telepathically when you are awake. However, you will forget that phone call conversation with Kyle again when you wake up. Apologies for telling you all of this in one dream session, but there is only so much I can tell you at one time. I&#39;m not even sure I CAN talk to you in your next dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
Echo&#39;s voice was getting harder to hear as Jen started hearing shouting from the real world. &quot;You will wake up soon. Talk to you later friend, sweet day dreams.&quot;<br />
<br />
The darkness faded away as Jen opened her eyes.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
Jen woke up.<br />
<br />
As she/he opened his eight eyes, he thought about his dream.  All he can remember from his dream was meeting a girl who called herself Echo and how she explained to Jen that his emotions and how she/he sees himself can partially control his changes. Every thing else about that dream was a blur. (She/he forgot about anything related to the town curse and how Kyle and Echo are related to it.)  <br />
<br />
Jen then thought back to when this all started. When did this all went wrong? What caused her transformations? Was it a spell cast by a witch or some kind of virus she doesn&#39;t know about? And why is it that every time Jen thinks about what caused his  transformations, he thinks of Kyle? Does he has anything to do with this? <br />
<br />
Just how did he went from a impatient cheerleader trying to get to the bus to a young chimera rooted into a hole dug up by a homeless?<br />
<br />
 His thoughts were derailed he realized were he was. He was in a abandoned house away from society, accompanied only by Samual the Homeless. <br />
<br />
His &#39;big brother&#39;, Samual was nowhere to be seen right now..<br />
<br />
Tears began to well up in his/her eyes as he realize that he will never be able to go back to his normal life again. He will never be able to see his parents again or do the things he could do as a cheerleader. Even though Sanmual is probably still upstairs, Jen is feeling very alone at the moment. As he felt the weight of what happened yesterday, Jen felt tears welling up in his eyes. This is his life now.... but he miss his home soooo much. <br />
<br />
When Jen tried to sob and yawn the sleepiness away at the same time, it sounded like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yaasssswwaaaaasssssss&quot; &quot;Waaaaaasssssss!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen began crying really hard now. He can&#39;t go back to his life as a cheerleader and that thought terrifies him.<br />
<br />
What can Jen do now?<br />
<br />
