<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The end of the school year finally came. Jeff was graduating from high school! At the end of May,  the Big Day came and went. <br />
<br />
May turned to June,  and he had to think about either getting a job or going to college. Probably had to do both. But he wanted to enjoy this summer and his parents weren&#39;t pressuring him. He was a good student,  and made good marks. A high B average. So they werent too concerned about him taking it easy for a couple of week. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Jeff,  this left him to his own devices. The &quot;calling&quot; became stronger and stronger. &quot;I COULD turn myself into a god damn donkey forever,  if i really wanted to....&quot; <br />
<br />
The Fourth of July! His favorite holiday! Always felt like a &quot;pre-birthday&quot; to him,  as Jeff was a July baby. It was always four weeks of the best time of his life every year. Mid-summer. Lots of parties. Lots of hanging out. Friday night pizzas. Monday night movies. No responsibilities. Camp fires. Hikes. The beach. The local amusement park. It was the height of what life was supposed to be. <br />
<br />
He was waking up at 9:00 AM on July 4th with the thought of spending some good old fashion summer-time fun with his friends and family. But....what if,  instead of having a good time,  he would turn into a god damn genuine full-throated donkey in body!?<br />
<br />
What if he did so in front of everyone?<br />
<br />
What if he lost all control over his own donkey body,  and was forced to act like a &quot;normal&quot; donkey,  save for allowing himself to periodically bray out his unintelligible protests<br />
<br />
What if he smelled really badly,  with the same slimy green-yellow teeth, his body full of fleas,  with flies buzzing all around him?<br />
<br />
What if animal control were to come and take him away to a farm somewhere? An Amish farm  specifically,  where they&#39;d break him and work him? <br />
<br />
What if he was forced to go along with his donkey instinct-driven body as it mated with natural-born female donkeys,  and he was forced to graze and eat hay?<br />
<br />
What if his mind had major regrets doing that to himself,  with major feelings of restrictiveness throughout his entire body?<br />
<br />
What if it were all so terribly final and permanant? <br />
<br />
These thoughts made hin hornier and hornier,  on this fateful Fourth of July. Two weeks before his 19th birthday .<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,  i have to do it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff ran to his closet where he kept the blasted infernal machine these past several months,  untouched. Upon seeing the devilish machine,  he started leaking pre-cum! His heart pounding,  he plugged it. Placed it on his desktop. Turned it on. <br />
<br />
He was holding onto his stiff member for dear life. He set out all of the perameters. It wouldnt be completed instantly this time. He wanted to think sadly about the last time he&#39;d have each of his human parts as they were replaced with donkey parts. And it would happen at around noon when everyone was outside in the yard,  sitting down to eat. Food he&#39;ll be denied as a filthy donkey. It&#39;ll last a half hour,  before he was a full donkey and taken away. Never to see his friends abd family ever again except for one occassion where they&#39;d travel to hos new farm to check him out. He&#39;d display his full donkey behavior in front of them,  as he mounted a farm jenny. He&#39;d try to communicate with them, but his body would refuse to comply. <br />
<br />
He was extremely horny and ready to blow. He hit &quot;Enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
His mouse pointer hovered over &quot;Yes.&quot; And with his penis on the verge of squirting,  hit the button. <br />
<br />
&quot;No going back now. Im GOING to be a...a....&quot; DONKEY!!&quot; &quot;GUSH!!&quot; <br />
<br />
That over,  he sat his desk,  trembling from the aftereffects of having just ejaculated. He was looking at the screen in shock at he had just done. The screen read out all of the parameters. Jeff sat there with a sinking feeling of doom looking them over. What had he done?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. This isnt real. This isnt going to happen, &quot; he told hinself. <br />
<br />
He looked at the clock. 10:00 AM. Two more hours until his supposed doom. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked back over the running program. Maybe he could stop it? There was no &quot;cancel&quot; button. He tried escaping the progran,  to no avail. It refused to close until it had completed its programmed routine.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well,  maybe if i unplug it...&quot; thought he. <br />
<br />
Jeff reached for the plug to take out of the wall. When he pulled it out,  the screen didnt go bkack as he expected. It remained on,  and continued counting down! A message in the top right corner:<br />
<br />
&quot;Power disconnected while executing program. Reverting to backup battery. Instituting emergency protective protocol&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf? Well,  i guess ill just have to smash the thing then&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached out to grab it,  but his strength seemed to fail him. He backed off and tried again. Everytime he reached for the machine,  the emitter would light up,  and he&#39;d feel almost paralyzed.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to use a weapon to smash the thing. He ran down to the basement to grab a hammer, and came back to his room. But he somehow repelled from entering! <br />
<br />
&quot;Donkeys do not belong in human habitations., &quot; he could read the screen from his doorway. Jeff felt an intense desire to go outside and remain there until it finished. But he willed himself ti remain. He was about to throw the hammer through the doorway,  but his body seemed to not obey! There was a checkmark next tobthe option about him &quot;losing control of his own body!&quot; His facial ecpression went blank,  and against the protests of his mind,  he dropped the hammer,  went back downstairs,  and went outside. He sat on the porch,  and there he remained for the next couple of hours as guests arrived for the holiday.</p>
