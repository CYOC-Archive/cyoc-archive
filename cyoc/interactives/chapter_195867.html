<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam took a few more deep breaths, recovering from the sudden lust he had experienced. His mind still on Matt, unable to distract himself from those thoughts. Not that he wants to, his good-looking protector has made this shit situation turn into something nice. At least... he hopes that. There are still the two others in the family, plus this whole house stinks of BO. <br />
<br />
Even now, it&#39;s still all around him. That stench of a locker room after a hard day of sports. Of a gym that&#39;s never cleaned the equipment. Though he notices more than just the stink of sweet, another musk alongside it. One that he could not realise until now, cum. <br />
<br />
Sam stands from the bed, shocked that he didn&#39;t realise it earlier. Looking at his sheets and boxers, realising that he has just contributed to the home’s stench. Worry fills Sam as he changes from his wet underwear into a clear pair he brought along. Looking into the piles of clothes and towels around him for something to clean the bed with, but finding his hands wet the moment they grab the fabric. The clutter around the room still damp with sweet or cum... maybe both.<br />
<br />
Sam reels back once more, heart beating faster, and cock starting to throb. Him shaking his head, looking down at his hard dick once more and muttering to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. What&#39;s going on? Is it starting to affect me?&quot;<br />
<br />
He thinks back to Darrel, how suddenly his housemate changed and become such a different man. Is he going through it all now too? He has to resist it; he has to get out of here. He doesn&#39;t want to end up a jock like his friend or this family. <br />
<br />
With newfound resolved, he thinks of how to lessen the surrounding temptation. Deciding that the best answer is as simple as it gets, gather up all the dirty clothes and towels around, and put them in the wash. His hands will get dirty... but it&#39;s better this than slowly succumb to whatever is happening.<br />
<br />
Finding a basket, Sam places as much as he can inside, and walks out of the room. Back to the living room of the house, where he sees the two half-brothers hard at work. Matt and Harry, both in singlet and shorts, laying side by side. Sweating profusely as they do sit up after sit up, counting each one and trying to outdo the other. Their ripped bodies doing the repeated motions, deep voices grunting as they push themselves harder and harder.<br />
<br />
Samuel stops in place, holding the basket by his side and just watching the two compete. Harry smaller than his brother, but still an impressive specimen of his own. However, his eyes are locked on Matt. Even more attractive than moments ago thanks to the covering of sweat from his workout. Sam feeling that familiar arousal, and familiar desire.  He needs to get moving, and get out of this room. But he just can&#39;t, it&#39;s heaven in here, both the view and the smell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samuel jumps back instinctually, unfamiliar to the voice of Martin as he drops the basket. The older man letting out an awkward laugh in response to the reflex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to scare you.&quot;<br />
&quot;U-uh no. Sorry that was my bad.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not a problem, Sam. You doing some washing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of them look at the basket of clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Harry&#39;s old stuff, right? Just getting it in the wash.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ahh, thanks! I&#39;ll handle it if you want.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
He reaches for the basket, knowing that this is a good chance to leave the room before he gives in to temptation. But before he can get a grip of the handle, Martin has already lifted it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright Sam. You&#39;re a guest. Just relax, I&#39;ll get breakfast for us all once these are in the wash.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay... thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin walks off as Sam stands there awkwardly, hearing the grunts in the background. Trying to focus on anything else but finding his view slowly moving over. The two now shifted to push ups, using a single arm for support as their muscles are flexed and their bodies tried. He wonders how long they have been going at this, curiosity taking over his caution as he starts to walk over. Sitting on the nearby couch and staring at the two as they train. Something rising in him as he watches Matt and Harry, something that he starts to let out as a new confidence takes root.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kick his ass, Matt!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam says out of nowhere, a grin emerging from Matt as his pace starts to quicken. Grunts louder as he pushes himself past his limit. Overtaking his younger brother as the two continue their workout for another minute. Finally stopping with one last yell, before they swap to their backs and lay on the ground. Panting, exhausted, and both smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;121&quot;<br />
&quot;114&quot;<br />
&quot;FUCK YEAH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt’s fist is raised, the two brothers laughing, and Samuel joining in. Laughing alongside them as he reaches for a pair of towels set aside. Tossing them to the two and getting a joined &quot;thanks&quot;. Wiping away sweat from their bodies, cleaning their entire selves from chest to head to pits. Before finally passing the towel to the other, and bringing it to their nose. Taking in a deep sniff as one hand holds the sweat-drenched fabric tightly against themselves, and the other sneaks into their shorts and starts to stroke their cock.<br />
<br />
Sam has been following these new instincts so far. Enjoying what has resulted of them, shouting out that support for Matt, tossing these towels. But now it&#39;s telling him something else, something that his mind still finds hard to accept.  For him to embrace the smell of a man’s workout, embrace the rugged activity and join the two in their current course. Matt and Harry already lost in grunts and moans, a steady pace shared by the two as their hands move up and down their shafts. <br />
<br />
A grunt escapes Sam&#39;s lips soon after theirs, him not even realising that his body has taken charge. Hand already in his shorts, jerking his hard pole in synch with the others. Voice joining their chorus as the three avoid any thought and just enjoy the feeling of rubbing themselves to the smell of a morning’s workout. Sam locking his sights on Matt as he strokes himself, looking at the rugged man and enjoying the sight. Taking in every detail, every muscle, every smell. Feeling a strange sensation emerging from his chest and arms, but unable to realise what it is as he continues to be lost in lust. <br />
<br />
The three soon give in entirely, boxers and shorts covered in spunk as they recover from the ordeal. Harry and Matt tossing the towels aside, and Sam getting a fraction of his senses returned. Looking to the two brothers, then to his chest... seeing that it&#39;s far different than before. Pecs covered in hair, arms a forest, alongside his pits. He&#39;s becoming rugged... and it&#39;s hard not to be happy with it. All senses at war against themselves as he tries to process it all. This place, himself, Matt, and above all else that wonderful smell of BO.<br />
<br />
The two brothers stand back up as Sam is lost in thought. Matt walking over and taking a seat next to him, once more wrapping an arm around his shoulder and pulling him in tightly. Sam secure against his protector, and within perfect distance of his reeking pits. Beyond happy as the war is won by the invading side, at least for this moment as he relaxes against his crush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the cheers.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not a problem, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam replies to Matt, not even questioning his new language, nor his dumber sounding voice. His former self assimilating into this new form, but still trying to resist, still fighting. <br />
<br />
&quot;You liked the show?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hell yeah!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah! Still against training?&quot;<br />
<br />
A new resurgence of willpower emerges within Sam. He knows that was the question that will seal his fate. That this is his only chance to resist what is happening before it was too late. But it is so hard to resist. The stench of the family was perfect, and he would love to be as big and sexy as the rest of this family. Plus... if he gave in and just became another stinking Jock, he would be able to be with Matt all the time.<br />
<br />
His decision was made, a part of him having won this moment as he answers</p>
