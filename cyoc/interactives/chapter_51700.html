<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sighed as you closed your locker. This was your first day at your new school and you had somehow managed to make enemies a guy named Kirk Johnson. All you did was stand in front of your first period class and be introduced. It seemed he took an instant dislike to you. Maybe he just didn't like your name. Or perhaps it was just because you were new. You turned and saw Greg Heinemann standing there smiling. &quot;Hi Danny,&quot; he said. &quot;I know you don't have many friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely not Kirk,&quot; you said bitterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he's not that bad,&quot; Greg said. &quot;He's just mistrustful of new people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well how do I get him to trust me?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you do it the slow way just don't do anything to get him mad at you and he'll eventually come around,&quot; Greg said. &quot;But there is a much faster way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Greg looked around to make sure that you were alone then said, &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrugged and followed Greg hoping that you wouldn't get in trouble. He stopped outside of the girl's locker room and put his hand on the door. &quot;We can't go in there,&quot; you said surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry we won't get in trouble,&quot; Greg said making it sound like a promise. &quot;It's a rite of passage for the new kids. You hide in one of the lockers while the cheerleaders change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we get caught though?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you stay quiet you won't,&quot; Greg said. &quot;I think I know what your problem is though. You respect girls so you don't want to see them undress. I can respect that and so does Kirk. All you have to do is stay hidden in the locker. You can close your eyes if you want. I'll get you out when they leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to do it,&quot; you said. You did respect girls too much to do that even if you did shut your eyes.<br />
<br />
“It’s either this or Kirk makes your life miserable before he trusts you,” Greg said. “He’s pretty popular around here and if he decides to make life rough for a freshman then he will. You don’t want to know how rough it can get. Now you can either do this and earn his trust quickly or wait for about a year. It’s your decision.”<br />
<br />
You sighed and said, “Alright lets get this over with quickly then. I don’t want to get caught and get in trouble.”<br />
<br />
“You won’t get caught as long as you remain quiet until I come get you,” Greg said leading the way into the girl’s locker room after checking to make sure no one was watching. He went to a specific locker and after putting the combination in he whispered, “Get in and remember to stay quiet.”<br />
<br />
“How did you know the combination?” you asked beginning to get a little suspicious.<br />
<br />
“I saw the combination on some of Miss Cole’s paperwork awhile back,” Greg whispered. “The girl whose locker this was left a couple weeks ago so no one will be opening this locker. Now be quiet and if you want to close your eyes.”<br />
<br />
You squeezed in and closed your eyes as Greg shut the door. You fervently hoped that someone wasn’t going to open this locker. You heard voices coming in. “I think the new kid is pretty nice,” one said.<br />
<br />
“Too bad you’re a lesbian and he’s a boy,” another said.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I’ll try being straight for him,” the first said.<br />
<br />
There was giggling and then a third voice said, “You know that won’t happen. Not even Superman could straighten you out.”<br />
<br />
“Be nice to Alice Amy,” the second voice said.<br />
<br />
“She knows I’m just playing with her Megan,” Amy said.<br />
<br />
“It’s all in good humor,” Alice said. “Besides she’s right. I don’t think Superman could straighten me out.”<br />
<br />
There was more giggling as you heard lockers being opened. You quickly ran through the names of the cheerleaders. There was the head cheerleader Megan Jones whose parents were rich. Or so you heard. You also heard that Megan wasn’t a stuck up snooty rich cheerleader. She was suppose to be really nice. Then the was Amy Gruenberg. She was Megan’s second. You heard she liked to joke around. Then Alice Mayberry. She was a known lesbian and very flexible. She was also a freshman like you were. You had seen her in the halls and thought she was very attractive. If only you could be a girl then you might have a chance of going out with her. There were three more cheerleaders in this little posse. Patti Boone, Sara Greenleaf, and Monique Freeman. You wondered if they were there and just not talking. You heard a locker open really close to you and Megan say, “Well look what we have here girls.”<br />
<br />
You opened your eyes to see all six of them looking at you. They all had their tops and bras off. You quickly closed your eyes and said, “Sorry. If you’ll cover up or lead me out of here I’ll be on my way.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you like girls?” Megan asked.<br />
<br />
“I do,” you said hoping that you’ll be able to get out of this situation.<br />
<br />
“Then why do you have your eyes squeezed shut?” Amy asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to see you naked,” you said. “It’s disrespectful.”<br />
<br />
“Then why are you in my locker?” Megan asked.<br />
<br />
‘Oh crap,’ you thought. ‘I’m in trouble now.’ “I’m sorry but I was told no one would be opening this locker,” you said. “I didn’t even want to do this but Greg said it was the fastest way to get Kirk to trust me.”<br />
<br />
“Those pigs,” Megan said with venom in her voice. “They’ve done it to another freshman.”<br />
<br />
You were so surprised that you opened your eyes and asked, “What?”<br />
<br />
“At the beginning of the school year Kirk pretended to instantly dislike this new guy named Henry,” Megan began to explain as she grabbed your hand and pulled you out of her locker. “Mike Morgan gave him the same story he gave you. Though they never got in trouble for it because it couldn’t be proven that Greg, Kirk, Mike, or any of their friends had anything to do with it. Mike had just said that Kirk respected those who took risks when he was asked about it. Saying that he didn’t think Henry would sneak into the girl’s locker room and my locker. Henry got suspended for a month and barred from all sporting events for the year.”<br />
<br />
“My mom and dad are going to kill me if I get suspended for a month,” you groaned.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name?” Megan asked.<br />
<br />
“Daniel Thompson,” you replied.<br />
<br />
“Well Daniel do you like Alice?” Megan asked.<br />
<br />
“What does that have to do with this?” you asked thinking that Megan was a little crazy. This was hardly the time to ask such a question.<br />
<br />
“Just answer it,” Megan said.<br />
<br />
“Yes I do like Alice,” you said. “But I know that she’s a lesbian and I don’t have a chance with her.”<br />
<br />
“That can be taken care of,” Megan said. Before you could ask how she continued, “I have a plan where you won’t get in trouble and we can teach those pigs a little lesson. All you have to do is play along.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t I just go out the door?” you asked looking at the girls nervously. You had the idea that they might dress you up as a girl so you wouldn’t get in trouble.<br />
<br />
“Miss Cole will see you,” Alice said. “And I’d like to get to know you better.” She smiled then and it made her very pretty.<br />
<br />
“What do I have to do?” you asked sighing.<br />
<br />
“Just don’t answer the question I’m about to ask you,” Megan said. You were confused and your confusion only grew when she asked, “Daniel, transform or dare?”</p>
