<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff, or Jenelle as her ID now showed, spent the next few weeks adjusting to her new life. For the most part, things had remained as they were before, only with a more feminine flair to them. But some things, like who her friends were, had slightly altered. For example, she found herself to be closer friends with her best friend&#39;s sister than himself, and that the two of them, while they were still close friends, were a bit more awkward around each other than they had been. Specifically with how he treated her more as if she was a fragile object, and not like the best friend they had been since kindergarten. Instead of being rough and casual with her, he would keep himself in check and try not to swear as often around her, despite Jenelle saying that she didn&#39;t mind him doing it. <br />
<br />
In the first 2 months following her return to humanity, Jenelle and her former best friend began officially dating. Though she didn&#39;t understand that this was what he meant when he asked her to go with him to the movies. She had agreed and only when he mentioned that he felt that their date went well, did she realize what she had just done. But she did have a lot of fun, and didn&#39;t want to make things even more awkward between them either. So she had just rolled with it at that time. 3 weeks later, they were going on yet another date, only this time, Jenelle was actually aware of it, and she even was looking forward to it. She even bought herself a new outfit for just the occasion. She new his preferences already, so she had gotten an outfit that she knew he would love seeing too.<br />
<br />
Jenelle had also found out that not all of her had fully been returned back to being human as well. For one, she absolutely could not stomach any form of meat, and would almost instantly vomit it back up. However, she could eat as much grass as she wanted, and boy did she ever. When she could do it alone, Jenelle would often head out to her back yard, sit down on her hands and knees and just eat the grass for her breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was both cheep and effectivly kept her back yard cut. And thanks to the fence, she could do it in private as well. Though when out on dates, just keeping her meals down to basically a salad would work too, using the excuse that she is a vegetarian helped too.<br />
<br />
If it were just the plant-only dietary restrictions, then she could have lived with it. But unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the case. Jenelle quickly discovered that what went in, had to come out eventually, and that she still didn&#39;t have any say as to when it happens. If it were not for her obvious baby bulge, buying diapers for herself would have been so much more embarrassing than it turned out to be. Thankfully, most people see a pregnant woman with diapers and just assume she is stocking up for the future baby, and do not check the package label saying that they are meant for adults to wear, and not infants. And she could make it so that people thought it was at least normal with the Chronivac too.<br />
<br />
Another change only began about 2 days ago for Jenelle. She woke up one day to find that no only had her breasts gone up about half a cup size, but that they also had begun to lactate, and more worryingly, her nipples were lengthening too. And if that wasn&#39;t all, her baby bulge was turning a rather familiar shade of pink, as 4 small lumps showed signs of being formed. She was actually regrowing her udder. And since it was all for her future baby, the Chronivac refused to change it, or her digestive system for that matter. <br />
<br />
But the final change, which Jenelle found out this morning, worried her the absolute most. She awoke to find her pussy had turned pitch black, and had moved locations, along with her asshole, to where they would be if she still were a cow. Bending over now gave anyone behind her a perfectly framed view of both holes of her black, leathery holes, completely exposed and unprotected. With her ass cheeks no longer covering up any part of either of them, and instead, had parted ways in order to make room for them to stick out on full display. <br />
<br />
The reason why this one worried her the most, is because if she has a cow&#39;s vagina, then likely she isn&#39;t pregnant with a human child, but almost certainly a calf. How can a woman possibly give birth to a literal cow? Could she even survive such an ordeal? And what would her friends and family say when they discover that she has been bred by a bull, and not fucked, then abandoned, by some nameless guy? Would they be mad? Or would the Chronivac make them think everything was alright? Would her boyfriend dump her if he knew the truth? Or perhaps he does already know the truth, and is staying with her even still? She hoped it was this, as she has come to enjoy his presence beside her as her boyfriend, and not just her friend.</p>
