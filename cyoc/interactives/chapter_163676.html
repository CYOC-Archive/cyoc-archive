<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily’s breasts looked somehow lower on her chest now. <br />
<br />
The streets by now were mostly full of jennies, stumbling around and into each other. A few semi-changed girls also walked by, occasionally sniffing for the jackass. Maybe Dan was the only male donkey on the island, so being one meant being fought over. So Emily had to bray them loudly and violently to get these jennies away. She was not going to share her male. “I saw him first.”Emily thought.<br />
<br />
“Hey look!” Dan said eagerly pointing at the mansion nearby. Many girls were running around it, throwing things through windows. These girls were not as changed as the ones they had seen, but that was rapidly changing as evidenced by the brunette bent over groaning as her ears exploded into ass ears and her butt expanded. <br />
<br />
“Let’s go!” Dan heard throaty moaning and no response. <br />
<br />
“Emily?” He looked back. She was doubled over, clutching her stomach. Dan headed over to her and helped her up. A look of utter bliss was on her face. Dan saw her breasts actively moving. <br />
<br />
Emily looked up him, and grinned. “They’re so warm!” She lifted up her shirt. His breath caught in his throat. Her belly looked bloated, and the skin with a light gray fuzz on it. But what really drove him nuts was her breasts that were visibly moving down her belly. They had turned black and leathery looking. <br />
<br />
As Dan watched they settled on her lower abdomen.She dropped her shirt and looked up at him. “One day they will be full of milk...”<br />
<br />
“She’s so hot!” Dan thought.<br />
<br />
“Let go.” Emily said, gesturing again at the mansion. Dan brayed his agreement and the two finally entered the big house. <br />
<br />
The big house had been smashed, bashed and broken from thrown bricks and stones from all of the changing jennies. And in some places there were large holes in the walls, in the shapes of hooves.<br />
<br />
Emily picked up a large rock. “Smash it!” There was a large, bay window in the front of the mansion that remained unbroken. <br />
<br />
Emily threw her rock. It shattered into a million pieces. She brayed out a laugh.<br />
<br />
“Smash!” Emily flung another rock. Dan joined her. Both yelled “Smash” in unison. They flung stones and bricks at the house. Then they moved inside to continue. <br />
<br />
They smashed glass, furniture, any wall not in pieces, it didn’t matter. The longer they moved through here, they wanted to break it more.<br />
<br />
“We never had a place as nice as this.” Dan grumbled, flapping his lip back in annoyance. “Like that lamp there!” He picked it up and balanced it on his hand. <br />
<br />
He looked around and grabbed a conveniently placed crowbar. <br />
<br />
“Dan steps up...bottom of the ninth...game on the line...” He threw the vase in the air, it came down and he swung, smashing it into a million pieces. The sound of the breaking ceramic filled his whole body with warmth.<br />
<br />
“Amaaaawzing.” Emily said. More and more of her words were breaking into brays. She grab a rock.<br />
<br />
“My turn.” She said. Standing in the front room was a large, wooden pillar. It had pieces and chunks knocked out of it by many rocks before. Emily flung full force. Smash! A cloud of splinters exploded out of the pillar, now leaving it hanging on by just one piece. She grinned, or tried with her muzzle, at Dan.<br />
<br />
He should have been terrified at the sight of the complete donkey head on Emily’s shoulders. But being terrified would get in the way of fun, and feeling good. Nothing was more important to him.<br />
<br />
“AH!” Dan suddenly yelped and pulled away. He had felt the strangest sensation. As if his fingers were pulled together. He raised his hands and saw that his fingers were indeed pressed together on both hands, and that the ends of them were encased in a strange hard material.<br />
<br />
Emily rubbed her own hands. Her fingers were looking...kinda puny. Meanwhile both her palms were starting to swell.<br />
<br />
“Something’s wrong with my hands!” Dan complained, shaking them. They felt heavier as he did, the shaking seeming to cause his wrists to extend. When he stopped shaking them, he blinked, confused. }<br />
<br />
“Where’d my fingers go?” His fingers were gone, and there was a shifting black mass on the end of each arm, that looked rather like clay. Brown hair coated his stretched wrist.<br />
<br />
“Look better.” Emily said. Her palms expanded, bulging out from her fingers. Her nails shriveled up in the face of the growing black mass. Her thumb slid into her hoof, followed by her much shrunken fingers. The two new hooves were hard as a rock and disc shaped<br />
<br />
Emily clacked hers against Dan’s hooves. Dan’s addled brain couldn’t really comprehend what he was seeing as he held up the hooves on the end of his arms.<br />
<br />
Gray fur grew from Emily’s wrist, over the tops of her hooves. “Feel good me.” Emily found speaking to be increasingly hard. She could understand scent, body language and brays, that was good enough. Why on Earth did she need to use words?<br />
<br />
Emily’s voice was thick, and much deeper. Dan’s eyelids were fluttering as alien sensations were flooding his body constantly. His ears moving to every sound, his tail swishing over his ass, and now the hooves that had replaced his hands. <br />
<br />
He gave a stupid grin and slapped his hoof against the drywall putting a hole in it. Emily brayed a laugh and clapped with her hooves. Then she slammed her hoof in beside his. The two left two holes in the dry walls, from two sets of hooves from two stupid asses. The two then continued, punching holes in the wall, since grabbing stones was now impossible. <br />
<br />
Dan stopped. “You start to look prettier.” He said, his hoof stuck in the wall alongside hers. He felt his cock extend from its sheath and went to try to unzip his pants, but the hoof just knocked uselessly against them.<br />
<br />
“I want mate...” Emily said, watching him. “Can we…” <br />
<br />
The door to the mansion opened. Both of their ears stood up as they heard several obnoxious jennies coming in. Some were speaking, some were puking and most were braying. Emily pulled in closer to Dan. They hadn’t seen them yet. <br />
<br />
Emily glared at them, her mane bristling, her ears erect. Her body suddenly felt like it was being coated in ants. <br />
<br />
“Want to go.” Emily said, nudging Dan. “Want to go.” The other jennies by now had stopped braying at each other. Dan and Emily could hear them sniffing the air.<br />
<br />
“A jackass!” One of them said. <br />
<br />
“My Jackass.” Emily said and pushed herself in front of Dan.<br />
<br />
The zipper of Dan’s jeans snapped loudly, and Dan’s equine cock flopped out and stood erect. <br />
<br />
Now several female donkeys poured into the hallway. Most were hooved, one was in distinguishable from a normal donkey if not for her blue eyes. <br />
<br />
One of them said to Dan, moving past the others, “Mate with me.” This donkey girl turned around and presented her naked butt raising her furry tail. <br />
<br />
Dan seemed confused. There were so many females nearby. But then Dan heard and thick ripping sound and looked down to see that his shoes had burst, dull black hooves stuck out of the toes. That feeling made it regain some sense, his mate was Emily.<br />
<br />
“Emily we go!” He said. “Come, run!” They ran past the jennies, still with enough intelligence to outsmart them by moving a little out of their way.<br />
<br />
Dan burst out of the mansion with her, standing shakily on his hooves. His tail thrashed behind him, trying to keep balance. The park was a scene of chaos. No one was just enjoying themselves anymore. <br />
<br />
One of two things were happening, sheer terror, or sheer bliss. Emily’s shoes were feeling funny and Dan was moving faster. She looked down at his shiny hooves, then at her own shoes. <br />
<br />
“Why they not hard too?” Emily thought. “Need faster!” She picked up the pace, moving beside Dan, her heart hammering in her chest. <br />
<br />
“Where go?” Emily asked. Her shoes began to pop and burst as her feet morphed into hooves.<br />
<br />
“Not know.” Dan said, looking left and right. The huge holes that were his nostrils flaring as he took in the scent of hundreds of horny jennies.<br />
<br />
“I know where!” Emily exclaimed.</p>
