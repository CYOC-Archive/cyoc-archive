<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The routine was at this point normal as nothing out of the ordonary happened. Mom had someone visiting her and Jennifer would spend her day with her imagination. Silvia had once again bought some take-away pizza and had given the whole box full of pizza to her daughter as she hastily returned back to her room. All what Jennifer could make out was that her client wanted to see her mom eating dozen of boxes of pizzas.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was jealous that her mother had friends like that. One day she would also make someone else to pay for her food just like they did for her mother. Happily Jennifer devoured the whole pizza with her hands as the taste was heavenly. Eating the warm pizza more than quickly accumulated a lot of air inside Jennifer&#39;s gut which in return came back out as disgusting burps. She could hear her mother doing the same on the other room as she gave out a mixture of a loud moan while her mouth was stuffed to the brim with, what Jennifer assumed, was pizza.<br />
<br />
The evening turned into a night and with a gleeful smile on Jennifer&#39;s face she begun to take her slumber. She hadn&#39;t offended anyone this time and was feeling the changes happening inside her body. Dreams of her mom and her. Jennifer thought how blissful it was to enjoy a warm meal.<br />
<br />
As the morning light set it&#39;s sunlight to the room. Jennifer noticed that she had turned on her stomach during her sleep. She patted the flat but weird flabby stomach and felt a bit confused by her increase chest size. Was it a dream that she was pregnant or did she get older. The room had some minor upgrades from band posters to an actual smartphone of her own. The screen had a crack on it but it worked nonetheless. For Jennifer this was luxury even if it came in very small packages.<br />
<br />
She then saw herself on the cracked full body length mirror and was almost spooked as a seventh grader was staring at her. No. That was her in the mirror. She slowly walked closer towards the mirror and saw that she had small black skull tattoo in-between her neck and shoulder. If she wore more than her tanktop it could be easily hidden with a longsleeve or a t-shirt. As she looked closed she noticed that she was wearing a similar yet different looking velvet panties what she stole from her mother. The texture felt nice as she run her finger on them.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was amazed how her hips had widened a little bit as they were clearly the bigger part of her body. Something about her overall body felt off as she glanced at it from top to bottom but she wasn&#39;t sure what it was. To her she looked like a normal 7th grader with &quot;some&quot; extra feature but if she had t-shirt and proper pants she could haven&#39;t looked different from anyone else in the class.<br />
<br />
The dampened smell of dirty laundry and crusty carpet was maybe the only indicator of her lifestyle choices.<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard a knock from her door followed with: &quot;Mom&#39;s- I mean grandma&#39;s here. Come to say hi to her.&quot; Without thinking she went as is to the kitchen and saw her grandma Mary for the first time. Grandma Mary looked like a proper mom would as Jennifer guessed her to be in her mid thirties. Mary was feeding a baby on her lap with a bottle and had a unprecedented relaxed conversation with Sylvia. The kitchen was filled with an artificial airspray-like freshener which smelled way worse and intoxicating than what Jennifer had grown used to. She tried to hold her gag reflex as she approached closer to the kitchen table. Then she saw that the kitchen area was cleaned from the trash and dirty clothes. Or maybe all of them were quickly thrown in to her mother&#39;s room before Mary showed up. Jennifer didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Sylvia had taken out the fancy coffee and the expensive canned and frozen produce to serve to her mother. Sylvia was wearing some proper clothes this time with a bra which included a tubetop, a jacket, leggings and daisy dukes. She also had some skin-colored patches all over her body. Jennifer could tell from a mile a way that Silvia had to put these on to looked decent for Mary&#39;s sake. Grandma Mary noticed Jennifer entering the kitchen and turned her head towards her as if to judge what she was currently wearing. Sylvia intercepted her and told Mary that Jennifer liked to wear the blouse inside the house and that all her clothes were in the washer at the moment. Jennifer apologized and explained that she was so excited to see her grandma that she forgot to put some proper clothes on her.<br />
<br />
Mary took a small sip from the ceramic coffee cup, shook her head and didn&#39;t question things any further.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you can handle your money and take care of her. I let you live in this house. Just remember that.&quot; Mary as she took another sip from ceramic cup like a proper lady while giving a side-eyed stare to Sylvia.<br />
<br />
Jennifer sat on the table and looked at her mother Sylvia who gestured that Jennifer was free to take whatever she wanted from the table. Deep down Jennifer knew that her mother meant by &#39;take whatever&#39; that she could take a small quarter of a cup to show grandma that they were living decently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer. My first grand daughter how&#39;s the school treating you?&quot; Mary asked as she wanted to know how Jennifer was doing.<br />
<br />
Jennifer lied that she was doing fine and that her tests were better than average. On the side Sylvia nodded her head with a fake smile as she offered more premium coffee for her mother Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great news. I hope your mother isn&#39;t causing you any trouble.&quot; Mary stated. &quot;I think you already know by now that your younger sister is going to live with me until she is old enough to go to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was puzzled what grandma Mary meant by this but didn&#39;t ask or show any signs of being curious and just accepted it as a fact. Jennifer thanked for the meal and said that she had to catch up with her studies for today. So with the most polite and ladylike bow she slowly went back to her room and waited until grandma Mary would leave the house. As Jennifer had a lot of questions to ask what was going on.</p>
