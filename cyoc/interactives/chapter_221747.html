<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wyatt, 16 years old, was socially awkward. He wanted to fit in with the other boys but he just didn&#39;t have the same interests as them. It&#39;s not that he wasn&#39;t athletic. He enjoyed running and swimming and biking. He hoped to one day go for the Iron Man Triathlon. But all the other boys were obsessed with football and Wyatt just meh about it.<br />
<br />
Also, Wyatt wasn&#39;t exactly straight. He wasn&#39;t exactly gay either. He did not fantasize about having sex with men but he did fantasize about shrinking Chris, a 16 year old football player from his school. Wyatt wanted to keep Chris naked. Wyatt hadn&#39;t actually seen Chris naked before as even when Chris was naked, he was covered by a towel. Other than that, Wyatt didn&#39;t know what he wanted to do with Chris. Just the idea of keeping Chris naked was enough to drive Wyatt&#39;s fantasies.<br />
<br />
Chris was homophobic. He was safe enough. He didn&#39;t go around bullying the gay kids but he wouldn&#39;t let any of the gay kids hang out with him and his friends: John, Mike, and Timothy who went by the nickname Moth. So it was surprising when Chris invited Wyatt to go with them on a trip to Pleasure Island. It didn&#39;t arouse suspicion because Chris had invited Wyatt to hang with the group before and nothing happened. But hanging out with Chris and friends didn&#39;t mean that Wyatt was one of Chris&#39; friends. It&#39;s not that Wyatt was unpopular. No one hated Wyatt or bullied him. He was just ignored most of the time. So Wyatt agreed to go to Pleasure Island with Chris and friends.<br />
<br />
On Friday night, Chris pulled up to Wyatt&#39;s house in Chris&#39; jeep which was already full of John, Mike and Moth and their luggage. Wyatt put his suitcase in the back as, from what he&#39;d been told, they&#39;d only spend the weekend at Pleasure Island and be back at school on Monday. Then the jeep, crowded full of guys, was off.<br />
<br />
Everybody was friendly toward Wyatt. Moth even gave Wyatt a beer. Wyatt didn&#39;t normally drink but decided to give it a try. They listened to great music on the radio which they all sang along to. They asked Wyatt about his triathlon plans. They talked about the latest movies they watched. Then they all started to get drowsy as it took hours to drive to Pleasure Island.<br />
<br />
There was a hotel on the island that was not part of Pleasure Island. That is, even though it was easy to walk between the hotel and Pleasure Island, there was a barrier that kept the magic of Pleasure Island away from the hotel. Everyone knew that there was magic at Pleasure Island and that one needed to be cautious but that most of the island was safe and in particular, the hotel was safe.<br />
<br />
The boys unloaded the luggage and settled into the hotel room. Chris said that Wyatt would share one bunk with John and Moth while Chris and Mike took the other bunk. John fell asleep immediately. The rest stayed up watching t.v. for a while. Wyatt found himself between the sleeping forms of John and Moth before he too fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning, the first thing Wyatt discovered was that he had the bed to himself. He didn&#39;t open his eyes as he was still sleepy but he spread out. The next thing he realized was that he was naked and that the bedding was scratchier than the bedding he had fallen asleep in. Wyatt did not spring out of bed but with his eyes still closed, he did wonder how he wound up naked in a different bed.<br />
<br />
He slowly opened his eyes and looked around. It looked like a normal hotel room except not the same hotel room and this room was missing a wall and ceiling. Then he heard Moth say, &quot;He&#39;s awake.&quot; and then he saw the giant faces of Chris, John, Mike and Moth gather around to look at him.<br />
<br />
Wyatt wondered if he was having a hangover or a drunk hallucination. He hadn&#39;t drank that much and didn&#39;t feel that bad, just sleepy.<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;Rise and shine sleepyhead. It&#39;s time to have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt tried to wrap the blanket around himself but the blanket was secured. The only way out of bed was to get out naked but Wyatt had to pee. &quot;What&#39;s going on? Where am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike explained, &quot;We are in Pleasure Island. We are in a place where people can be shrunk to doll size. We all wanted to play with a doll sized man but none of us wanted to shrink so we invited you to come along with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt asked, &quot;Why me? You&#39;ve never bullied me before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;We&#39;re not bullying you. We like you Wyatt. We think you&#39;re cool in your own little way. We&#39;re all still friends. You don&#39;t have anything to fear from us. We&#39;ll keep you safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt couldn&#39;t wait any longer. He said, &quot;Excuse me.&quot; and got out of bed and ran to the bathroom. The hotel actually had a working bathroom although it wasn&#39;t like they shrunk a bathroom. The toilet was designed to look like a thimble and the bathroom was also missing a wall and ceiling. The friends continued to watch. Wyatt looked over at his audience and blushed with embarrassment. &quot;Why are you watching me pee?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike said, &quot;Because it&#39;s so cool. You&#39;re just like a real man but tiny. It&#39;s amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt tried to turn away from their gaze but he couldn&#39;t turn very far without missing the thimble toilet.  He also wondered just how full his bladder was because it felt like he would be stuck there for hours.<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;Don&#39;t be so shy. We&#39;re all guys. I want to see your tiny dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt asked, &quot;I thought you hated gays.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;I do but none of us is gay. You&#39;re not gay, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt didn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;Well anyway, you&#39;re one of the guys and we are going to hang out at Pleasure Island and have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt said, &quot;I don&#39;t see any clothes. I thought my clothes were supposed to shrink with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
John said, &quot;They did. Last night we got you sleepwalking and guided you here. It was difficult to convince the staff that you were awake but we managed to convince them that you wanted to shrink. After you were doll sized, we took your clothes away from you and put you to bed after we examined every micrometer of you to make sure you were okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt shuddered at the words, &quot;Every Micrometer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Moth said, &quot;We had to make sure you were okay. We wouldn&#39;t want you to have any health problems. By the way, did you know you have a dark spot on your balls near the back where it would be hard for you to see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt felt his balls for anything out of the ordinary and didn&#39;t feel anything. The look on his face gave away the answer.<br />
<br />
Moth said, &quot;I knew it. Wyatt never knew about the dark spot on his balls. Pay up John.&quot;<br />
<br />
John grumbled and handed Moth some money.<br />
<br />
Wyatt just stood there paralyzed. Finally his piss stream came to an end but he just stood there.<br />
<br />
Chris asked, &quot;So, Wyatt, what do you want to do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt asked, &quot;What do you mean, what do I want to do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;I mean just that. We&#39;re all just good friends, hanging out and having fun together. What would YOU like to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt said, &quot;I&#39;d like some clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
John said, &quot;Nuh-uh, not gonna happen.&quot; All the other boys also expressed their disagreement with the idea.<br />
<br />
Moth even reached over and picked Wyatt up. He didn&#39;t ask permission. He just grabbed his friend. &quot;I think we should measure you first to find out exactly how tall you are. What do you say to that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris asked again, &quot;We want to know what you want. That doesn&#39;t mean you will get your way but we are all friends and want to make sure you&#39;re having a good time too.&quot; Chris rubbed Wyatt&#39;s head with the tip of Chris&#39; index finger.<br />
<br />
Wyatt said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be measured. I want to grow back to normal sized. I want to wear clothes. I want you to stop touching me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys laughed as Moth continued to hold Wyatt and Chris continued to pet Wyatt&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;No, seriously, what do you want to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt pondered silently for a while. He really didn&#39;t know what he wanted to do. He knew he was supposed to want to go back to normal but otherwise, his mind was completely blank. He felt that anxiety he often felt when taking a timed test. His mind had simply shut down. Finally, he said, &quot;Alright, let&#39;s find out how tall I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys expressed approval and took Wyatt to a place specifically for measuring tinies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eleven inches exactly.&quot; cried Moth, &quot;You owe me more money.&quot;<br />
<br />
John grumbled and handed Moth more money.<br />
<br />
Chris said, &quot;Okay, what&#39;s next? Shall we measure you some more? Do you want to go swimming or biking? Do you want to leave and explore other parts of Pleasure Island? Or do you have something else in mind?&quot;</p>
