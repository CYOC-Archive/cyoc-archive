<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…to change the situation.<br />
<br />
Phil was a bit complicated.  He was a bit of a contradiction.  He had an inflated sense of ego for absolutely no reason.  He wasn’t particularly good-looking, had never really achieved anything of note, and wasn’t extremely bright or witty either.  He was a fairly run-of-the-mill kind of guy.  For what his bad qualities were, however, he possessed several good ones.  He was kind and generous.  He had no prejudices of any kind, and particularly liked children.  He loved animals, too.  He was not violent in any way, either.  To hurt someone else was an abhorrent thought for Phil.  It was those qualities that had kept our bond so strong.  We also lacked any brothers or sisters of our own.  We also had a lot of similar interests.  We were into technology, video games and movies.  We weren’t huge sports fans, but we watched enough to have a causal interest and we liked the same teams.  The more I thought about all of this, I realized I loved having a sibling-like relationship with Phil.  It dawned on me what I would have to do.  I would have to change Phil into a woman, too.<br />
<br />
This bothered me though, too.  He wasn’t going to go along willingly.  I’d have to make him accept it.  To do that meant using the ring to alter his mind and that just made me feel nothing but guilt.  I wished I knew what to do.  Before I even realized I thought the word, “wished,” a voice entered my head.  “Just do it,” the voice said.  “He won’t care once you show him how wonderful you feel.  And don’t worry about planting the thought in his mind, either, you have the power of the ring for a reason,” the voice added as it gradually tailed off into silence.  The voice sounded familiar, but I couldn’t place it.  It was not the sound of my voice, either male or female.  It also wasn’t Phil’s voice.  <br />
<br />
Whatever the source of that voice was, it didn’t matter anymore.  I knew what the ring could do, I had wished to know what to do, and that was the answer I received, so I knew it was the right answer.  I made a very carefully worded, silent wish.  I wished that over the next few minutes new thoughts would slowly and gradually work their way into Phil’s mind that he felt he was also a woman trapped in a man’s body and that he would want to be a female, too.<br />
<br />
I decided the best way to not allow him to focus on these new thoughts was by distracting him with talk.  “Phil,” I said.  “I’m sorry for throwing all of this at you.  It wasn’t right of me.  You wouldn’t believe what this feels like for me, though, to finally feel natural in my own body.  I just wanted it all right away.”<br />
<br />
“It’s ok,” Phil said.  “I did walk in on you, but I also didn’t think you were home.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, what were you doing anyway?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Borrowing a movie,” he replied.<br />
<br />
“What movie?” I asked again.<br />
<br />
He furrowed his brow.  “I can’t even remember now,” he said.  He appeared to look confused by his sudden memory loss.  I assumed the effects of my wish began to manifest in his mind.<br />
<br />
“Phil, this is my fault and I hate to say this now, but you know we can’t be lovers, right?” I asked.<br />
<br />
He nodded.  “Yea, I know,” he answered.  “Under any other circumstances I’d be pretty pissed off about that…but I know it’s still the you I’ve always known…”  His voice trailed off as he shook his head a few times.  He finished his thought by saying, “It would just be too weird for me.”<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong, Phil?” I asked with a concerned look on my face.  “You look…well, you look troubled.”<br />
<br />
“Of course I am,” he said with a raised voice.  I recoiled slightly from him, a bit surprised by the change in his tone.  “Sorry,” he said when he saw me genuinely frightened.  “Wouldn’t you be troubled if your best friend and roommate suddenly turned himself into a woman, said it was what he always wanted to be, and then practically raped you?”<br />
<br />
Ouch, I thought to myself.  That was a pretty accurate description of what transpired.  “Yea, I would have to say it would,” I answered.<br />
<br />
“That’s not even the worst part of it all,” he lamented as he stood up and paced around the room.  He shook his head a few more times.<br />
<br />
“What’s worse?” I asked.<br />
<br />
He continued to pace back and forth while he stared at my body.  His gaze focused on my breasts.  “What does it feel like?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“What, having breasts?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“All of it,” he said.  “Being female.  Having breasts.  Having a…not having a penis.  What did female sex feel like?” he asked.<br />
<br />
I took a deep breath.  I did it mostly for his effect but also relieved in knowing that my wish worked perfectly.  “I really can’t describe it that well,” I said.  “My center of gravity is different.”  I stood up and walked up and down the bed.  “See?  My hips just kind of sway on their own.  Obviously there’s a new weight on my chest and I try to keep them steady as I go.  Kind of hard to do without support, though,” I added.  Bras were a definite necessity I quickly found.  <br />
<br />
“What about the sex?” he asked.  The look on his face changed from confusion to apprehension and now to eagerness.<br />
<br />
I sat down on the bed again.  “Sex as a male is fine.  But you only feel it in one place, really,” I explained.  “At least that’s how I always felt when I had sex.”<br />
<br />
“Those few times,” Phil interjected while he giggled like a girl.<br />
<br />
“Yea, yea,” I said with a mocking frown.  “To have sex as a woman, though…you just feel it everywhere.  The feelings aren’t centered on just that one area.  You feel it from head to toes.  It’s harder to come, but that’s a good thing.  It lasts longer so there’s more pleasure.  It’s just better in every possible way.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” he said.  “That does sound better.”  As soon as he said that he stopped pacing.  Now the worried look returned to his face.  He walked over to the mirror and looked at himself for a minute.  He repeatedly glanced over his shoulder to look at me and then back to the mirror to stare at himself.<br />
<br />
I decided now was the best time to act.  I got off the bed and walked to him.  I stood behind him but positioned my head so that my reflection could be seen in the mirror.  “Phil, you know I’m here for you,” I said.  “Just tell me what’s troubling you.  And don’t say it’s what we just did, because I know it’s more than that.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” he said softly as he continued to stare at himself.  “I want…I want…”  He seemed unable to find the words.<br />
<br />
“Don’t fight it, Phil,” I said knowingly.  “It’s OK.  It’s not weird.  It’s not wrong.”<br />
<br />
“I want to be a woman,” he said finally.<br />
<br />
I had to egg him on for effect.  “Are you sure?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I want to be a woman like you,” he said.<br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  “Just be patient.”  I made a silent wish so that Phil would become a woman in the exact same manner that I did.  I waited for the zipper to appear at the back of his head.  Once I saw it I took his hand and directed it to the zipper.  I kept my hand on top of his as he moved the zipper across his head but then removed it so that he could do the rest himself.  It gave me a better chance to admire his change.  The hair that emerged from within was bright red.  <br />
<br />
Phil did not stop moving the zipper once he started.  He kept sliding the zipper down over his face and neck.  Without hesitation he continued down his chest to his stomach and finally through his groin when the zipper stopped.  He reached up to his face and pulled apart the two halves of his male face.  The rest of his male body just kind of fell away and off his body revealing his female body.  He was absolutely gorgeous, just like me.  His fire red hair fell down to the bottom of his shoulder blades.  He had an angelic face with ruby red lips and green eyes.  His arms were thinner than mine, his hands were daintier, but his fingernails were longer.  His figure seemed to be a bit curvier than mine as well, since his waist appeared a bit smaller and his hips a bit wider than mine.  His breasts appeared to be the same size as mine, though he had larger nipples.  I helped him step out of the rest of his male skin.  His legs were also thinner than mine, and his feet were smaller too.  We were about the same height as males, and that was still true since he, like me, didn’t lose any height in this change.<br />
<br />
After I helped him take off his male skin, I stepped back to let him admire himself in the mirror.  He ran his hands over his body completely.  I could hear him gasp softly at the new sensations he felt.  He smiled as he continued to feel his new form.  After a minute his hands mainly concentrated on his breasts and his pussy.  I noticed that he had the so called “landing strip” above his pussy, and it appeared to be as neatly maintained as my own patch of pubic hair.  “This…is…amazing,” he said.  His voice sounded as sultry and sexy as my own.  He covered his mouth upon hearing his new voice.  “Wow,” he said.  “I sound as hot as I look!”<br />
<br />
“I know,” I said.  “Isn’t it great?”<br />
<br />
He turned to look at me.  A tear rolled out of his eye.  “Oh, god, yes,” he said and he ran over to me and gave me a tight hug.  “Thank you for this,” he said.<br />
<br />
“You’re so very welcome,” I said.  “We were like brothers, and now we’re going to be like sisters.”<br />
<br />
“You bet we are,” he said.</p>
