<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You rise early the next morning and prepare yourself for the day&#39;s journey. Graven shares a silent breakfast of bread and fruit preserves before handing you a satchel of food and telling you how to get to the mage&#39;s cottage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Before you leave,&quot; he adds, his firm hand on your shoulder, &quot;I must say a few words of warning. The forest outside the walls of Castrumiel is home to thieves, monsters, and other demons, as well as knights who lack the foresight or compassion I have shown you. I am sorry, but I cannot arm you against them in case your curse should turn you to the path of evil. I can only give you provisions and knowledge, and pray that you find your way. Finally,&quot; he pauses, staring you straight in the eyes, his height in these close quarters truly intimidating, &quot;should you return to Castrumiel in this form, I will have no choice but to kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
That dark note is the one on which you leave the castle town and start your trek into the forest. Heading towards your destination with only some food and the clothes you were given, you begin to reflect on how you ended up in this position. If you hadn&#39;t gone to that damned park and given in to curiosity, you would be comfortably living in the 21st century as a normal man. Now you were stuck in a magical past where you were ostracized as a demon through no fault of your own. Your only hope was this mage, so that is where you had to go. <br />
<br />
After several days of travel, you are beginning to worry you will never find this place. Taking a rest against a fallen tree, you contemplate turning back and begging Graven not to kill you and let you stay, not that you think he will be swayed. As you debate with yourself, you hear rustling in the bushes behind you and turn around just in time to receive a hard sucker punch to the jaw.<br />
<br />
You are knocked down and see your attackers are two young human boys, no older than their teens. Though, in this time period, they are practically adults. Their tattered clothes and scars reveal a hard life, and the masks they wear scream bandits. The older one with brown hair holds a dagger at your throat while the younger one with blonde hair aims his crossbow at your chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hand over your valuables, creature,&quot; the elder boy commands, &quot;and we might let you live.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to play turnabout on you,&quot; the younger one adds. &quot;We know it must have been tough to steal those clothes from Castrumiel with Graven around, but the better thieves win.&quot;<br />
<br />
You begin to panic. What can you do? Graven gave you no weapons or armor, and you knew you weren&#39;t skilled enough to fight them with your claws alone. It was then that you heard another voice in your head. It sounded like your own, but different, more...sensual. <br />
<br />
&quot;If they want your clothes, let them take them,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
You have no choice but to obey the boys and the voice. You nod in understanding and begin to remove your clothes. The satchel and vest are handed over to your assailants, along with your belt. As you remove your tunic, you can smell your own scent again: manly, powerful, exciting. Trapped in the fabric for days, your musk escapes its confines like a wave, hitting you and the thieves immediately and heavily. You notice their faces flush with red, sweat beginning to form on their young, supple skin. It was affecting you equally, making you yearn for what was going to happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t seem to remove my codpiece,&quot; you say seductively, not knowing why you were going along with it, but doing it nonetheless. &quot;Could one of you help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no tricks, d-demon,&quot; the older boy demands, having pulled off his mask and clearly fighting his urge to pounce on you. <br />
<br />
The younger boy&#39;s crossbow is shaking violently as his comrade sheaths his knife and kneels down to untie your string. He nervously licks his lips as the leather patch falls away to reveal your large package under the drawers. The younger boy gulps audibly. <br />
<br />
&quot;See something you like?&quot; you whisper.  <br />
<br />
Neither of them answer, but you can read the desire on their face like words in a book. They are clearly struggling with their lust, neither of them knowing why they were suddenly attracted to their mark. Their rag-sewn clothes did nothing to hide their erections and you longed to help them take them off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve done as you asked,&quot; you say, now left in nothing but your drawers. &quot;May I go now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; the older boy says, a little too desperately. &quot;Stay where you are. We...we need your drawers too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; you tease him. &quot;And why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you&#39;re hiding more goods in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; your voice is now dripping with seduction you&#39;d never considered yourself capable of before, &quot;far be it from me to keep you from examining my &#39;goods&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, you simply tear the undergarments away with your claw. Your naked body visible to the world and your pheromones given unrestricted access to the air around you. The boys see your package and their mouths drop along with their weapons. The younger boy looks to his comrade for guidance, but the elder thief is already approaching you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, come here,&quot; you encourage him. &quot;See? There&#39;s no need to fight. Let&#39;s be friends now and you can apologize to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I—I&#39;m sorry. Can I...touch it?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
You give him a sign of approval and he kneels in front of you, gazing up at your crotch. The younger boy is still confused by his feelings; he tears away his mask and calls out to his fellow thief in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aldritch! What are you doing, brother?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He doesn&#39;t answer, only replying by bringing his nose to your scrotum and inhaling deeply, your scent completing his corruption.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you come over here and join your brother?&quot; you coo.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...what have you done to him?&quot; the younger lad cries out in frustration. <br />
<br />
His fear is still outweighing his lust, and you feel he may not completely understand what these feelings are. He lifts his crossbow feebly and fires far above you, clearly too shaken to aim. You take a few steps towards him, towering over him and taking the crossbow effortlessly, his brother watching with a blank expression. You fling the weapon away and pull the young boy close, pulling him into a deep kiss. His muscles relax and his face takes on the same vacant demeanor as his brother as you trade saliva. His lips part and you enter his mouth with your long canine tongue. Once he is fully under your control, you release him and lay back against the log once more.<br />
<br />
The two boys come crawling over to you, breathing and blushing heavily. You motion them forward and take one in each arm, their young, hardened bodies cuddling close to your furry frame. Their faces are filled with heated desire, their eyes looking into yours longingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you boys ready to play nice?&quot; you ask them, to which they eagerly reply: &quot;Yes, Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then go ahead and show me how sorry you are. But first, take off those pesky clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
They nodded excitedly and stood up, each quickly taking off their ragged tunics to reveal thin but muscular torsos. The older one had a large scar across his left side, indicating a former wound from a fight. It was hard to believe boys so young had been through so much, especially seeing how they now behaved like obedient children. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Aldritch, was it? Help your little brother out of his trousers.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elder brother knelt down and untied his sibling&#39;s pants, pulling them down and off his ankles. They wore no underwear, leaving the younger one&#39;s erection exposed at eye level to his comrade. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think he deserves a little attention first,&quot; you say, pointing to the scene. <br />
<br />
Aldritch, understanding, takes his brother&#39;s member into his mouth, making his sibling squeal in pleasure. You watch happily as he sucks the younger one off, but you do not become erect, controlling yourself until the time is right. Were you not so entranced by the show, you might have been concerned how you were controlling that when you previously could not stop yourself from becoming entranced by your own lust. But you don&#39;t consider this at the moment. The younger boy orgasms quickly and you order the elder one to drink it all. Then you turn to the still-panting youngster and ask him his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bai-Bailey, Master,&quot; he huffs out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bailey, such a cute name. Come here, Bailey,&quot; he does as he is told. &quot;You too, Aldritch, and don&#39;t forget to take off your pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon the two are straddling your calves, their young equipment rubbing against your legs. You motion for them to service you, which they take to happily. They take turns massaging the area around your sheath until a familiar black head pops out. At first, it looks like a flaccid penis, but it soon begins to move in a decidedly un-penile way. As they caress your member, it regains its serpentine form, growing even longer than before until it has wrapped itself around each of their waists once. Aldritch reaches out and suddenly grabs your snake by the head to begin furiously making out with it, a sensation which brings you unbelievable pleasure. As he does this, Bailey laps at whatever portion of your cock his mouth can reach while furiously rubbing his own against you. <br />
<br />
Eager for the action, you release the youngster from your coil and bring him to stand in front of you, his legs on either side of your chest. You take his young member into your mouth and suckle it gently. He squirms in pleasure as you take his entire length easily, wrapping your tongue around it. As he squirts a diminished load down your throat, your snake expels its load into his brother. When you finish your orgasm, Aldritch&#39;s stomach is distended with your seed and he collapses happily between your legs while Bailey curls up in your arms. Your snake sucks Aldritch to orgasm and the three of you lay in the afterglow, the early evening sun warming you pleasantly. <br />
<br />
As time passes, the boys fall asleep against you. Recovering from the adventure, your normal senses return and you are struck by the gravity of what you&#39;ve done. While it was true they had threatened you and ordered the removal of your clothes, the fact that you had become so willing to corrupt them worried you. Were you already so far gone down the path of evil that you would defile two young boys? Was this really you who had done this, or was it the other voice in your head, the one who had encouraged this sodomy? Were you that voice, or was it something more sinister?<br />
<br />
Concerned by these thoughts, you gently remove the two thieves from your body and retrieve your clothes. As they slumber, you recover their weapons and tie their hands with their own rope, no doubt that which they had intended for you. You dress yourself again, now lacking your drawers, and empty their clothes of tools and weapons before tossing them down near them. By the time the summer sun was sinking to the horizon, mostly obscured now by the canopy of trees, the boys awoke to find themselves far less horny and far more restrained. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the—you bastard!&quot; Aldritch cried out at his predicament, waking his brother who also began struggling. &quot;What did you do to us?! You sick pervert! How could you make us do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blech!&quot; Bailey dry heaved, &quot;My mouth tastes like dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry about that,&quot; you apologize sincerely, &quot;but you two got yourself in this mess!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?!&quot; Aldritch spat. &quot;You did this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, you made me take off my clothes and expose my pheromones. All of us were overpowered by it, not just you. Maybe next time you won&#39;t try to steal from a lust demon!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Fine! We&#39;re sorry. Happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gods, I think there&#39;s a pube in my mouth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, I&#39;ve got my clothes back, so we&#39;re good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, can you untie us now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; you stop him, having come up with an idea while you waited. &quot;If you two want me to untie you, you have to help me find a white mage that lives in these woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should we help you? You just raped us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, you consented, so it wasn&#39;t rape. In fact, if I were to guess, I&#39;d say you enjoyed it more than how much my pheromones made you. Secondly, you&#39;re tied up, naked, and I have your weapons, so you really have to room to barter here. Your choice is help me or stay here like this. Once night falls you&#39;ll make a nice present for some beast or monster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine, we&#39;ll help you! Just let us go!&quot;<br />
<br />
You untie the two and let them get dressed, though you are sure to keep their weapons away from them. You tie the dagger and sheath to your own belt and sling the crossbow over your shoulder. The boys are now clothes in their rags again, Bailey still looking sick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so melodramatic,&quot; you say. &quot;You loved it.&quot; The two hung their heads at your words, realizing you weren&#39;t entirely wrong, but still upset by it. &quot;Now let&#39;s set up camp for the night. You can lead me to the mage tomorrow morning, then be on your way.&quot;</p>
