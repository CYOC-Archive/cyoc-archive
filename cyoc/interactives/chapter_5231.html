<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jarred was fast forgetting his heritage and quickly finding the passion for his new life. The stallion laid over the humped mare, his shaft so deep into her sex that his sheath had parted the vulva.<br />
<br />
Misses Morrison stood with the stallion over her hairy back, a mare's head hung low in submission. The wild and odd feelings of being humped as the animal she was, in her mind she felt disturbed. Her love for a husband was now being washed away in favor of this wonderful new style of making love.<br />
<br />
Moaning and often letting a high pitched whinnie from her rubbery lips, the Misses enjoyed Jarred's shaft.<br />
<br />
Jarred huffed and snorted in delight of this new and tight fitted conquest. Unlike most stallions who mount, thrust several times, sput out their semen and then dismount. Jarred was different, he wanted to mount mares! Mount and stay on top to get all the feel he possibly could, and rational memory from being a person no doubt.<br />
<br />
An hour had passed and after three more beers Mister Morrison was getting upset. The beer increased his male gusto and with rubber legs he tripped down the steps from the deck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Insulted, I'm insulted, she never enjoyed me like she's been fun'in with Jarred! he mumbled as he walked closer to the stable. A sound of a cork popping from a bottle came from the stable as a mare whinnied in delight.<br />
<br />
Rounding a corner of the barn's open door he saw Jarred licking the trails of juices from his wife's horsey butt. The animal face of his wife turned to see him and with a whinnie of her gratitude she gave a ponies' smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never gave me sex like that woman!&quot; babbled Mister Morrison.<br />
<br />
Walking into the big box stall the insensed man dropped his jeans and flopped out a pretty pink penis. &quot;What's he got that I don't! he yelled.<br />
<br />
The response from Jarred was a true horsey laugh as he snorted at the weak and short manly tool. Prancing about the stall Jarred waved his long black cock for all to see. The pride in his mounting and the delight in his length made the pony prance with joy.<br />
<br />
Standing in the stall and looking down at his less than stallion's sized penis mister Morrison began to mummble. &quot; Damn it dear I only wanted.... You made the wish to be as.... You and Jarred had such... OH dear that crazy Medallion changed our daughter to a Palamino mare for a day! But, but I changed her back to the girl and she's in her little bed upstairs. I, I, I, ah wanted to give you only the best!&quot;<br />
<br />
A scrabling hand digs out the Medallion from his watch pocket. &quot;This damn thing is the cause of all our troubles. It changed Jennifer's friend Jarred into that stud of a pony. It changed Jennifer somehow to a Palamino mare, and you to this perfect brod mare. I could win some good ribbons at show with you and Jarred! Hey think of the price I'd get for a pure bred American Shetland stallion at stud! Hey let alone the price for one of your foals with him as the sire, wow!&quot; said Morrison.<br />
<br />
A flick across his face of a coarse haired tail of his mare wife brought him somewhat back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey damn it you stupid mare! If I could have a black cock like Jarred's I'd be able to give you one hell of a good screwing.&quot; mister Morrison spouted.<br />
<br />
The Medallion in his hand glowed red hot and with the sudden heat he dropped it into the straw covered floor.  A moan from his mouth and he bent over till his forehead touched the mare's withers.<br />
<br />
Eyes closed tight as the pain surged in his groin. Another moan and as the pain subsided he stood up. Still holding one hand on his wife's withers to steady shaky legs he stood up slowly.<br />
<br />
The whinnied from Jarred was followed by one from his mared' wife. A look about soon brought into sight his very erect, super black, extra lengthened stallion shaped cock. The monster organ waved about in the air as it stood erect and positioned to mount a mare.<br />
<br />
At first a moral Christian fear came over the man but as he touched the member his passion welled up. Breathing heavy and almost snorting he approached his mared' wife's rump. The look back to her changed husband did not give her the instinctive desire to let him mount. A tail tightened down over her holes as legs were also held tight together. Mister Morrison looked at the mare and from his experiance with horses understood.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me and look I've been given enough for your new body! Hey I can mount you and still touch you as the husband could, or do you just want to be humped?&quot; Morrison said with anger in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn It!&quot; he yelled and then gave a hard kick to the mares flanks.<br />
<br />
Jarred was not so far gone into animal mental state that he did not feel anger toward this action. In a sudden move he charged mister Morrison knocking his face down in the shit strewn, straw covered floor.<br />
<br />
Morrison laid there the wind knocked out of him till his hand touched the Medallion. A fit of anger and embaressed he sat up. A patooie as he spit out a small road apple that had enter his open mount from the fall.  Holding the Medallion up into Jarred's face he hollared, &quot; I wish that you were that foolish boy again! I wish my wife to be her womanly self to be the mother of my daughter! I wish, I wish!&quot; he stopped and sitting in the straw looked down at the stallion's cock he owned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish this all never happened, that Jarred, Jennifer, and Mother would not remember this whole stupid affair. I wish that I didn't ever know of the power this Medallion owns! I wish... I'd wished... I'd wanted...always to be like one of my horses. I wished for years to be just as that pure bred pony stallion there that Jarred was lucky to become! I wish that as he is a boy I would be become the great stallion and no one out there would remember me as a man. My embaressed  past would be a secret and .... oh Hell !&quot;<br />
<br />
The Medallion glowed !</p>
