<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well what Now?” inquired Stacy as the four friends stood around at the edge of the dance floor area which was now more of a play area for the kids while their parents tried to figure out what to do. <br />
<br />
“THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO SPEAK!!!” yelled a voice from a nearby table as a small battery powered radio which volume had been turned down to save power was turned up as a crackling voice came over the speaker.<br />
<br />
“The President is about to speak from the Oval Office about what is going on in New Orleans.” Stated a voice as everyone rushed toward the radio. “And now…here is the President of the United States of America.”<br />
<br />
“My Fellow Americas, we have all seen things we never thought we would see today.” Said the President’s voice “We have seen stuff out of some fantasy novel or movie as almost the entire population of one of our great cities was transformed within moments into different types of magical and or mythical creatures. We have seen Dragons fighting in the skies and unicorns running down city streets. While we are still in the process of figuring out what has happened, this investigation will take weeks maybe even years but I have come before you to share with you all what we have learned and the state of situation in New Orleans and the surrounding area<br />
<br />
“We have located the source of the energy wave which seams to have caused the mass transformation, a type of crystal or shard was sealed in a vault in the swamp lands outside of New Orleans and when it was broken it released this energy which transformed the people.” Stated the President “While we are in the process of translating the ancient writing in the vault it tells us a story, a story we didn’t know about our planet.”<br />
<br />
“It appears that in the distance past, magic and magical creatures where very real until an order of wizards and witches arose and came up with a system to transform magical creature into either humans or normal animals. However like energy magic can’t be destroyed but it can be stored.” Explained the President “They transformed the energy into shards and sealed them away, that is what the oil team hit and when it broke it released the magical energy and that energy went about transforming everyone it touched.”<br />
<br />
“So that is what happened to us?” inquired a voice in the crowd<br />
<br />
“Shut up.” Ordered another<br />
<br />
“It is said this group of witches and wizards sealed the magic away in vaults around the world, we do not know how many or their location and they intend to lock away their own magic in the end.” Stated the President “We do not know if they did this, but if they did it may be impossible to return or magically transformed citizens back to their human bodies.”<br />
<br />
“My God no.” cried a women as everyone shared a look with each other.<br />
<br />
“But do not worry, we will do everything possible to get you back to normal and while you have changed you are still citizens of the United States and will be treated as such.” Reassured the President. “That being said, we are facing difficulties within New Orleans. Some people have given in to the animal like nature of what they have become, and we are forced to fight them and while we have made progress it is slow going so those within the heart of the City may be on their own for a while, but we shall arrive.”<br />
<br />
“And that is not to say that all transformed citizens have given in to their new nature, we have seen video of men and women who have been transformed helping each other, doing their duties for their nation and the human race and they have shown us that even if they lack a human body, they are still in procession of a human soul.” Stated the President “We shall restore order to New Orleans and to the nation as a whole. Thank you, Goodnight and may God bless everyone in New Orleans, in our nation and around the world.”<br />
<br />
For the longest time no one spoke as the radio broadcaster went back to reporting about the situation in New Orleans and reports from around area. From their reports it sounded like the transformation which started in the swamps outside of the city spread out over an area of over 150 miles but the greater the distance from ground zero the more likely you would remain human. To the point that if you where living in a town on the edge of the wave only 1 or 2 people in the whole town may be transformed while people in New Orleans itself had an almost zero chance of not getting transformed. <br />
<br />
“So we are stuck like this?” inquired Lindsay as she looked at her fur covered hands, bodies and her nine tails.<br />
<br />
“For the moment at least.” Confirmed Barbara to her little sister, they where only 5 months apart thanks to being step sisters, Barbara’s mom and Lindsay’s bio father both had left shortly after each where born and Barbara’s father meet Lindsay’s mother and got married when the girls where 5. <br />
<br />
“Could be worse.” Stated Stacy<br />
<br />
“I guess.” Said Elizabeth as the realization that she would likely be stuck as a fairy sank in, for others around it was harder to accept the news that they where likely to remaining monster/creatures for the rest of their lives.<br />
<br />
“I…I can’t stay like this.” cried a medusa women as her multiple snake like hair moved back and forth, not biting anyone but showing their fangs none the less. “I have a wife and kids back in Texas…”<br />
<br />
“It isn’t good for everyone.” Stated Lindsay as she looked at herself again. “Some of us are more human than others, but at least I am not something totally creepy.”<br />
<br />
“True.” Said Barbara as she looked around, with everyone gathered around the radio, people had cleared out from the Bar area. Someone had broken into the club’s supply of beer/liquor and people were helping themselves.<br />
<br />
“Come on, I worked bar at Uni I can make us all some stiff drinks.” Stated Barbara as they headed toward the bar. She jumped over the counter and started to make drinks, the four of them where quickly joined by others as people turned to drink to help them with their pain. Since it appeared that Barbara was the only one skilled enough to make good mixed drinks, she began the bar tender for this small group of people who where now facing their new realities. She made dry drinks for some of the kids, keeping herself busy helped her not focus on the change but as the hours dragged on more and more people either went to sleep or became passed out drunk. Some people like Elizabeth found their new bodies didn’t handle drinks all that well however Elizabeth couldn’t hold her drinks when she was a human but as a fairy it was worse. <br />
<br />
It had to be almost 2 am when Barbara pulled herself the last drink of the night, everyone else had either gone to sleep, where passed out drunk or keeping an eye on what was happening outside. They could still hear the sound of gun fire, explosions and the screams of different types of creatures out in the darkness but no one wanted to go out and check. She left the bar and was about to head upstairs to get some sleep when she heard a voice coming from behind her.<br />
<br />
“Where do you think you are going?” said Stacy from behind her as she turned around.<br />
<br />
“To bed, where I thought you would be.” Stated Barbara with a grin, everyone else was out so it was just the two of them with some candles and camp lights pushing back the darkness. The candle light bouncing off Stacy’s new cat like eyes and off Barbara’s golden bronze scales where beautiful to each other.<br />
<br />
“Well we are on a dance floor and everyone else is asleep so, care for a dance?” inquired Stacy as Barbara grinned. <br />
<br />
“Kind of bold of you? Aren’t you worried about someone seeing us?” inquired Barbara as Stacy rolled her eyes<br />
<br />
“I am a cat women and you’re a dragon woman, we are monsters who is going to care if we are lesbian monsters?” stated Stacy as Barbara smiled and followed her out onto the empty dance floor. <br />
<br />
They proceeded to slow dance in the candlelight, Stacy’s cat tail snaking around and wrapping around Barbara’s waist pulling herself closer. Barbara followed suit by extending her golden bronze rings with yellow skin between the wings and processed to wrap them around both herself and Stacy pulling her closer to her as they kept dancing in the candlelight.</p>
