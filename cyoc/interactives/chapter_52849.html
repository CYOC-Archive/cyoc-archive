<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were marched out of the house and into the woods. Of course you couldn't see exactly where you were going because of the hood which you thought was the point. You tried to figure out how far you had gone and in which direction but you took so many twists and turns that you couldn't keep up. Finally Claire said, &quot;Here we are,&quot; and the hood was removed. You could tell that you were deep in the woods. &quot;Off with your clothes girls,&quot; Claire said and everyone followed that order including you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You took your bra off,&quot; Hannah observed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it is a bit uncomfortable,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll get used to it if you remain human or can switch back from your animal form,&quot; Claire said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens if I don't shift and stay human?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I may get another little sister,&quot; Claire said. &quot;Or I'll just leave you as you are now. Now this is what's going to happen. We'll be transforming into our animals and Hannah, Lily, and Ashley will head back to the house. Kelly and I will stay behind to observe you. That's all we'll be doing is observing. We won't be helping you at all so you'll have to rely on yourself. You can't leave the woods. If you try you'll be transformed into a tree if you haven't shifted yet. If you have then leaving the woods before morning will make your form permanent. Do you understand?&quot; You nod and Claire continues, &quot;Ok girls. Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah was the first to transform. All her hair receded into her body and it looked like scales grew. She got down on her belly and her legs fused together as her arms fused to her sides. Her body seemed to stretch out as it became thin. Her head tilted back and flattened. Her ears shrank until they were no longer visible. Her mouth pushed out while her nose became two holes above her mouth. The scales became dark grey and near black. She had become a python.<br />
<br />
Lily was the next to change. Her hands and feet became hooves and her neck stretched out. Her face pushed out into a horses muzzle while her body gained muscle and fat. She fell onto all fours as her hips and legs rearranged. Her ears grew larger and triangular while migrating to the top of her head. Her hair arranged itself to become a mane and black fur grew over her body except for two white crescent moons over her eyes which had grown bigger. Finally a horse tail grew out of her ass.<br />
<br />
Ashley began shrinking and her hair shortened. Her ears grew small and her eyes beady as her face pushed out into a muzzle. Her hands and feet became paws with tiny claws. She fell to all fours as her hips and legs rearranged. Her hair changed to black with a white stripe and spread over her body. Once it reached her ass a tail grew and her change into a skunk was complete.<br />
<br />
Kelly's hair shortened and turned grey. Her face pushed out into a wolf's muzzle while her legs and hips rearranged causing her to fall onto all fours. Her arms and legs slimmed while her hands and balls of her feet became paws. Her ears became triangular and migrated to the top of her head. The grey hair grew over her body and a tail grew out of her ass completing her change into a wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to take those studs out of your ears,&quot; Claire said coming over and taking out the studs. Next she put all their clothes on Lily's back. Hannah slithered around Lily's body essentially tying down the clothes. Claire picked Ashley up and placed her on top of Hannah and the clothes. She then came over to you and moving behind you she placed her hands over your eyes. &quot;Ok Lily go,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
You heard Lily walk off but couldn't tell which direction she went. Finally after you could no longer hear Lily you asked, &quot;Are you going to take your hands from my eyes tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire did take her hands from your eyes and stepping in front of you said, &quot;It's time for you to find your animal spirit. Part of me hopes that you'll remain human so I can have another little sister maybe and another part hopes you pass through the initiation. Remember that Kelly and I will be watching you so we'll know if you did or not.&quot; With that she began to change. Her transformation followed Kelly's though her hair became red and she grew smaller. In the end she was a fox and she and Kelly slunk off into the trees.<br />
<br />
You looked around and picking a direction started walking. You were getting a little cold and you started rubbing your arms hugging yourself. You began to wonder how you would find your animal spirit. You figured you'd have to know what it was before you could change into it. After about an hour or two you hadn't figured it out but you needed to pee. Walking up to a tree you were going to pee like a boy but you didn't have a dick to grab. Sighing you turned around and squatted to pee. It felt weird peeing from a different spot and you wondered if you would get used to this.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later you came up with an idea. You closed your eyes and took several deep breaths turning your focus inward. You stayed like this for about fifteen minutes when you got an image of an owl. Concentrating on that you began to change. You shrank while your fingers stretched and your thumbs disappeared. Your feet became talons while skin grew between your fingers and from your body to your arms. Your arms rearranged to become wings while your face flattened. You nose and mouth grew together and became a beak. Your eyes grew taking up most of your head and your ears disappeared. Feathers grew out of your skin and tail feathers grew out of your ass. Of course your breasts receded into your chest and you could feel your vagina, pee hole, and asshole merge into one. You looked around and noticed that you could see like it was day. You flapped your wings and flew up to a tree branch. You had found your animal spirit. Now you just had to hope that you'd be able to change back in the morning.</p>
