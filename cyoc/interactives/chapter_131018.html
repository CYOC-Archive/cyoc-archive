<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie’s plan, while simple on paper, was risky. Kellie and Claudia were going to lead Mary Elise into an empty classroom so that Mary Elise and Claudia could talk. Claudia, as well as Kellie, hoped that the two might be able to bury the hatchet after so many years. While the girls hoped they could finally forgive each other they were not very optimistic. Mary Elise seemed very bitter about the whole thing. While Claudia hoped an apology from her could heal old wounds she knew it would be a long road to forgiveness.<br />
<br />
“So where are you taking me,” Mary Elise asked. Kellie smiled as she guided Mary Elise towards an empty classroom. “Well,” she answered. “I’ve been having a lot of trouble in chemistry already. I heard through the grapevine that you were the best tutor in school.” Mary Elise frowned at Kellie as they continued to walk. “So just trying to use me to get a better grade,” she grumbled. “No it’s not like that,” Kellie said defensively. “Look, I...I kinda wanted to get to know you a little better to okay. You seem like a nice enough person and....welll...figured it would give us a chance to talk.” Mary Elise frowned as the two continued down the hall, she had experienced this kind of thing before, each time it ended badly, sighing she continued to follow Kellie hoping for the best.<br />
<br />
“So what would you like to....” Mary Elise paused as she saw the meek figure of Claudia sitting at a desk. “I should of known,” she grumbled. Turning quickly Mary Elise glared at Kellie as she tried to exit the classroom. “Mary Wait please,” Claudia implored. Mary Elise turned glaring at her former friend. <br />
<br />
“Look Mary,” Claudia sighed. “Please I....I was hoping we could talk. Don’t be mad at Kellie though I..Uh..kinda asked her to help me out with this. I..well..I figured you wouldn’t want to talk if I asked.” Mary Elise glared at both girls as she prepared herself for the worst. “We’ll be quick,” she said sternly. “I’m not gonna just wait around for the rest of your friends to come in and ridicule me.”<br />
<br />
Kellie stood back as she looked the two girls over. Both girls looked pained as they stared at each other in silence. “Listen Mary,” Claudia said. “I..I know I was wrong with what I said about your dad. I...shouldn’t of said that. It was cruel...I..I just wanted to say I was sorry.” Mary Elise narrowed her eyes as she looked at Claudia. “After 3 years you finally want to apologize!?!” She spat. Claudia turned red as she lowered her gaze to the floor. Mary Elise turned to Kellie, now turning her venom towards her.<br />
<br />
“She asked you to bring me here so she could apologize,” she yelled causing Kellie to wince. “Did she tell you how her friend Lisa and Kumiko jumped me in the bathroom after our fight. They said it was payback for hurting her dad.”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know they did that,” Claudia pleaded. “I never asked them to fight my batttles. I felt bad enough about what I said. Still you shouldn’t have said what you did about my dad.”<br />
<br />
“And I tried to tell you I was sorry,” Mary Elise groaned. “Except every time I came near you your pet hulk Sammy and the two bitches threatened me. After awhile I just said the hell with it and the hell with you.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t call Sammy the hulk,” Claudia retorted, turning red with anger. “She gets a bit self consciousness about her height sometimes. She’s a sweetheart. As far as Lisa and Kumi I can’t control those two. You know what their like, they’re wild and uncontrollable but they’re not really good deep down.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve never seen the good in them,” Mary Elise snorted. “All I See is the hot volleyball player that got everyone to call me misery and her fashionista bestie that took it upon herself to make my life miserableness cause her twin has had the hots for you since the eighth grade.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she watched the two argue, this was not going as planned. Both girls had built up a lot of animosity over the past few years. As she watched she hoped these two could work through their issues. As she was about to say something she heard the door open. Turning she noticed Lisa and Samantha staring at the group. “The hell are you doing Misery,” she yelled. Mary Elise turned, glaring at Lisa. “Hey don’t pin this crap on me,” She’s yelled. “I was perfectly happy just reading a book before the new girl dragged me here.” Lisa now glared angrily at Kellie.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit,” she thought. “I know that look, Lisa wants to fight.”<br />
<br />
“You,” Lisa snapped. “You brought Misery here to attack Claudia. I knew I shouldn’t of trusted you.” Kellie held her hands up defensively as she slowly backed away from Lisa. “What no,” She’s exclaimed. “It’s nothing like that we...” Kellie dodged as Lisa threw a punch directed at Kellies face. Kellie groaned as when faces off against her former little sister.<br />
<br />
Kellie, after years of reality hopping, had become quite a good fighter. Many of the realities she had traveled through were very dangerous making self defense a necessity. While Lisa was more than capable of defending herself her skills paled in comparison to Kellies. “Don’t do this,” Kellie sighed. “I don’t want to fight. Let me explain please!”<br />
<br />
LLisa wouldnt Listen as she swung at Kellie yet again. Kellie was able to dodge the punch only to catch a knee to the stomach. Kellie winced as it connected. “Huh I remeber teaching her that,” she grinned. Kellie now pushed Lisa back, grabbing her arm and twisting it hard behind her back. Lisa screamed as Kellie pushed her into the wall. “Will you stop and just listen,” she yelled as she applied more torque to Lisa’s arm. Lisa began to wimped in pain as Kellie held her firmly against the wall. In a last ditch move Lisa tried to stomp down on Kellies foot only to have Kellie sweep her leg, causing her to crash to the floor.<br />
<br />
Lisa now lay in a heap with Kellie having placed her in a wrist lock. “Stop you’re going to break my arm,” Lisa yelled as tears began to run down her cheeks. Kellie held her firmly in place, she needed Lisa to listen and it wasn’t going to happen until she calmed down. Before she could speak she felt herself placed in a vices like bear hug. “That’s enough,” Samantha roared as she squeezed Kellie tightly.<br />
<br />
Kellie centered her gravity as she struggled against the Sonoran girl she strength. Kellie realized that their was no Way she could break Samanthas grip. “Let’s see if she can handle a grown woman,” Kellie thought as she activated her ring.<br />
<br />
Kellie now wished herself to be 26, in her physical prime. Kellie grew a couple of inches as her muscle mass increased. Although Samantha may be slightly stronger than her even as An adult she was able to gain enough leverage to break Samantha’s grip. Turning quickly Kellie delivered a quick kick to a stunned Samantha, knocking the teen backwards. “You May be strong,” Kellie mumbled. “But even you can’t handle a grown woman.” The girls stared at Kellie in shock. “H...how,” Lisa whispered as she held her arm. Kellie sighed sadly as she looked the girls over. “This isn’t definitely not how I wanted things to go.”</p>
