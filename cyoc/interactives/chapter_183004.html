<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn&#39;t take much time to get Chaman and Kamana situated. There have been so many cattle conversions that it was basic procedure by now. The only real delay was seeing to their new house. As bovines, they&#39;ll be bigger and heavier than what most human furniture could hold and they would need more headroom. But construction of the new Chinatown area was coming along nicely. The Rhino Guard&#39;s presence insured that anti-Asians wouldn&#39;t be throwing anything worse than insults at the new residents. A night shift was also standing guard to make sure there would be no attempted sabotage. Anyways, their new house/restaurant will be ready for them to move into soon. This would now be a good time for them to convert so that any adjustment necessary for their home will be ready.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
In anticipation of what will happen after their conversion, Chaman and Kamana rented a cabin at Lover’s Woods. Now that the pandemic was lifting, many of Animalia’s business were starting to reopen fully. Lover’s Woods would soon have plenty of converters, newlyweds, and other people who want a small romantic getaway.<br />
<br />
The Indian couple were looking forward to a day to themselves, renewing their marriage vows. And more than that, they were hoping for children. For some particular reason, they’ve been having trouble conceiving themselves. It wasn’t certain whether Chaman was sterile or Kamana was barren. But their conversion will make sure they’ll have children now. Sure, they may be born as calves now, but that’s a small price to pay.<br />
<br />
“So, I guess we had best get ready now,” said Kamana. She was wearing one of her looser, lower-quality saris. It wouldn’t last long, but she wanted to see how big she got in comparison.<br />
<br />
“So we should,” said Chaman, “At least it didn’t take them too long for them to make these.” He opened a small bag to show two dermal patches.<br />
<br />
“What are those?” asked Kamana.<br />
<br />
“They’re our dosages,” said Chaman, “I still carried some fur from my family’s farm. Now we can both be zebus.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, I thought we were just going to use the local breed,” said Kamana, holding up a thermos full of milk.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t I say I would take care of our dosages?” asked Chaman.<br />
<br />
“I thought I said I would,” said Kamana. There was a pause before they both started laughing.<br />
<br />
“Well, this is what happens when two hands don’t know what the other is doing,” said Chaman.<br />
<br />
“Indeed,” agreed Kamana, “So what do we do now?”<br />
<br />
“I suppose we can just take the patches and then drink the milk,” said Chaman, “That would be a double dose, right?”<br />
<br />
“Well, no offense to you or your family, but I’m not sure I’d want to be a zebu,” said Kamana, “The cows they have here are just more appealing to me.”<br />
<br />
“But that would mean we wouldn’t be together,” said Chaman.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be silly,” said Kamana, “We’d still be cattle, just different breeds. Animalia has no problem with Animalians of different breeds having children together. There are quite a few dogs and wolves paired, so I’ve heard.”<br />
<br />
“I guess that is true,” said Chaman, “This is just an unexpected turn.”<br />
<br />
“But not a bad one,” said Kamana.<br />
<br />
Soon after that, Chaman applied one of the patches to himself while Kamana drank deeply from the thermos. The effects were soon noticed. Whitish-grey fur was appearing on Chaman&#39;s body while dark grey was appearing on Kamana. Their temples throbbed before horns started growing out of them. Kamana&#39;s horns ended up being smaller than Chaman, which were curved over his head. Their ears grew out into bovine ears, though Chaman&#39;s were droopier than Kamana&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The Animalian virus spread through the rest of their bodies, making bigger and more muscular. It soon got to Kamana&#39;s breasts which made them grow larger than her sari could contain, shredding it open. Her sari soon tore over her growing hips and rear as well. Chaman&#39;s clothes were soon torn apart as he grew to bovine proportions. Though he wasn&#39;t becoming nearly as muscular as other cattle. Because the Indian zebu was obviously not bred for its meat, so did Chaman ended up svelter than other bull Animalians, though still in good shape. Another big difference was the hump growing on his shoulders. Like the camel, the zebu stores fat in its hump as an adaptation of living in hot, arid environments, such as India becomes outside of the monsoon season. Another noticeable difference was the dewlap growing from Chaman&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
When the transformation was finished, Chaman and Kamana made an interesting contrast. Kamana was like many Belgian Blue cows; she had an amazonian physique along with large breasts, her dark grey fur complimenting her own black hair. Chaman was an unusual but not unattractive zebu bull. The hump on his shoulders was not as obtrusive as might be imagined. It might give him a bit of a hunched look, but it was not too bulbous. Probably because there hadn&#39;t been as much fat in his body before his conversion. And while not as musclebound as other bulls, he wasn&#39;t without definition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is certainly different,&quot; said Chaman, feeling his new hump.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s certainly going to be an adjustment,&quot; said Kamana as she looked at her new body. She posed and flexed before saying, &quot;But I think I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it too,&quot; agreed Chaman. At that, his new bullhood emerged from its sheath. He may be built different from other bulls, but he was still quite beefy where it counts.<br />
<br />
Kamana stared at the bull cock, feeling powerfully aroused. &quot;So, I think we should put these new bodies to the test,&quot; she said in a seductive tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m way ahead of you,&quot; said Chaman, &quot;And I&#39;ve got something to help out with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Kamana.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Animalian version of the Karma Sutra,&quot; said Chaman, holding up the book he had purchased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh!&quot; said Kamana with excitement.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After that, there came a few hours of very passionate bovine sex. They tried about every position mention in the book, though they&#39;ll need to work on their flexibility for the more advanced positions. But eventually, they just laid down together, Chaman&#39;s cock still in his wife&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaman, there&#39;s something I&#39;ve been wondering about,&quot; said Kamana.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean what our children will look like?&quot; asked Chaman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes. Maybe something like those American Brahman I&#39;ve heard about,&quot; said Kamana, &quot;But I&#39;ve been wondering if we should change our name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? What&#39;s wrong with Dattachaudhuri?&quot; asked Chaman.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one can pronounce it,&quot; said Kamana flatly, &quot;It&#39;ll be hard to run a business if no one can get your name right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...that is a good point,&quot; acknowledged Chaman, &quot;Do you have something simpler in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gojaateey,&quot; said Kamana, &quot;I think that could work for a few reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... Like &#39;go to Gojaateey&#39; or &#39;Gojaateey to go&#39;? Yes, I can work with that,&quot; said Chaman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I can&#39;t wait to start our business and our family,&quot; said Kamana.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither can I,&quot; said Chaman before kissing her tenderly.</p>
