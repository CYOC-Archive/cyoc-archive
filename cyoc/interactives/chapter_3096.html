<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You ok there?&quot; Cliff looked at John &quot;Maybe you should let it settle a bit first.  Have you got a stomach ache?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Nah&quot; John took his hand off his stomach, which now felt full, and waved it at Cliff. &quot;It's probably just gas like I said.  Beans have a strong effect on me.  Mind if I re-couperate here for a bit?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sure thing.  Take all the time you need.  I'll pour you a beer to help it?  Something lite for you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You serve beer here?&quot;  John asked startled, and began to rub his belly.  He could feel alot of pressure in it
<br />
'I wonder if they sell any gas tablets around here' he thought to himself.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yep.  Different laws here.  Besides the beers here are pretty weak, about 20x, unless you order it specially&quot;  Cliff gave John a full glass of beer and began to fill one form himself.
<br />

<br />
John raised it to his lips and found that he had finished half a glass when he put it back down.  He looked up at Cliff who was starting to drink his own and saw that he had placed a keg ontop of the counter.  John rubbed his stomach and opened his mouth to compliment the beer but instead of speech
<br />
&quot;BUUURRRRRRPPPP!!!!!!&quot; a massive belch escaped causing John to blush.
<br />
&quot;Excuse me&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Woah.  That was a pretty good one there.  Don't worry about things like that.  We're guys and noone else is around.&quot; Cliff re-assured him
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah I suppose&quot;.  John continued to drink and talk with Cliff.  John didn't realise that a small paunch had developed on his now, not so falt stomach.
<br />

<br />
John started to rub it again, noticing that even after that champion belch, there was still that pressure, but luckily it didn't hurt.  John continued to drink and by about his fifth beer, felt the need to belch again
<br />
'What's it gonna matter? Cliff doesn't care'
<br />
John primed himself up for another burp, hoping that this one would end the feeling.  He turned his head to the side as Cliff watched with a slightly confused expression
<br />

<br />
John could feel the gas rise to his cheeks and the pressure slowly fade from his stomach
<br />
&quot;Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrppppppppppp&quot;  John could have sworn that the ground shook and his empty tray fell off the counter. 
<br />
John looked at Cliff as he started to laugh
<br />

<br />
&quot;That's the spirit&quot; Cliff said between giggles.  John started to chuckle, not noticing the changes that had begun.
<br />

<br />
John's gut began to slowly swell and was pressing the confines of his large shirt.  It sounded as if someone was blowing into a balloon quietly. John's whole midsection had begun to grow with his chest puffing out a little too.  John's thighs began to fill his large jeans making it look like he had put on some weight.  His but had also began to fill his pants as each cheek slowly grew to larger proportions.  His upper arms had begun to swell aswell, though they kept a more toned appearance.  The process ended with John's gut pushing against the buttons of his shirt.  John slid his hand down to undo his belt and brushed against his new gut.
<br />
&quot;What the?!&quot; John looked down at his new stomach.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Beer bloat got ya there hey?&quot; Cliff said as he peered down at John's 'paunch'.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, must be&quot; John said as he sid his belt off and put it on the counter.  He looked down and noticed the tray on the ground.  John stood and stretched his arms upward, showing how much he had inflated to Cliff.  There were definate curves there now.  Cliff noted that John didn't look like the type of guy who went to the gym as often as John said he did.  Cliff thought he looked better this way, with an obvious gut, large thighs and a fat but.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Wonder why I didn't notice that before&quot; Cliff mumbled to himself. 
<br />

<br />
John bent down to pick up the fallen tray.  He noticed that his gut hit his thighs before he even managed to touch the tray. 
<br />
'Man i get beer bloat hard here' He thought to himself.  John reached down further and let off a rip-snorting fart.  He quickly stood blushing furiously.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it.  No one's around and it doesn't stink&quot;
<br />

<br />
John was about to appologise when he felt his stomach- it was slowly inflating!  With a small hissing sound the small gut that was once his gut now grew to form a definite curve.
<br />

<br />
&quot;What's *urp* happening to *fart* me?!&quot; John looked up at Cliff.  All Cliff could do was shrug and stare blankly at the human balloon infront of him.  John's thighs had started to inflate aswell completely filling his once loose pants.  His but cheeks began to fill his pants forcing the to their limits as two  half basket balls of his flesh appeared in their place.  John's arms and shoulders inflated to look like he had some serious muscle, but covered with a decent layer of fat.  His pecs slowly became broader and began to rise a little aswell.  The most noticable growth was his gut.  It grew into a round spherical shape forcing his pants button to fly off, richoceting around like a bullet.  This allowed for more room and you could see his but crack now and the starining band of his underware.  His fly was forced down to accomidate his new stomach.  Little slits appeared in between the butttons of his shirt, exposing flesh.  His growth continued and slowly the buttoons were popped off his round mass.  Eventually all buttons had been forced off and john kept on expanding outwards.  Finally it stopped.  John just looked down at himself, speechless.  All he could notice was his bulging gut exposed to the world, a sphere of flesh hiding all but his pecs.  Even with his gut in the way, john could tell he had a massive hard on.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ummm, maybe it's not as bad as it looks&quot;  Cliff tried to reassure him and quickly whipped out a massive full body mirror from somewhere behind him. 
<br />

<br />
John looked up to survey the damage.  His gut was gigantic.  It looked like someone had forced him to eat a beach ball and had inflated it to it's full size.  His pecs were braoder too, but looked flat and muscular, unlike the globe under it.  John saw that his thighs and calves were also affected.  They had burst their seems along the side and his pants were straining to hold themselves together.  John slowly turned around and saw that with his gut, the sides of his torso had also grown out a little which completely obliterated his &quot;V&quot; shape.  It looked like he had love handles formed from a couple years' worth of drinking.  John twisted to see his but.  Two over-inflated basket balls filled and peeked out of his pants and boxers.  He could see his crack.  His back had puffed out a little aswell.  The only slight amount of muscle definition left on his body besides his pecs were his arms.  Unfortunately, both of them were large and looked like the were covered with a layer of fat.   John looked back at his reflection relived to find that nothing had happened to his face or neck, his strong jaw still defined and noticeable, his cheeks still regular.  Apart from that, John looked like a major porker and he would have thought he had gained a shit load of weight but he felt the same, just rounder.  He felt that the pressure had come back as if it had never left in the first place.  His gaze then fell down to his gut and he began to feel and rub it, sending shivers down to his cock.  Luckily, during the inspection, he noticed that it had remained the same size.  His small amount of rubbing caused John to give a small burp.  His body shook again and he inflated abit more, though no where the amount of before.  John noticed that his gut had a layer of fat over it that he didn't have before his visit.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well it looks like evry time you have a gas attack, you inflate a little.&quot;  Cliff told John while inspecting his belly &quot;It must of had something to do with the beans- you said you got gas right?&quot;
<br />

<br />
John nodded &quot;Never this bad tough&quot; John opened his arms to emphasize his problem.  He tried to join them around his guts circumference, but found that his finger tips could barely touch each other.
<br />

<br />
Cliff's tongue quickly darted out and licked his lips. &quot;Right well these sorts of things happen in toon world.  I'm guessing that it won't keep on happening.  Nothing really does in a cartoon right?&quot;
<br />
Cliff quickly adjusted his pants in a futile attmept to conceal his aroused dick.
<br />

<br />
John looked at Cliff and noticed that his gut was now bigger that the foxes 50&quot; monster.  This thought turned on John even more.  Quick flashes of the two of them, fat and feeling each other quickly flashed in his mind, forcing his dick to add to the pressure in his underwear, already straining to hold in his but and stomach. Suddenly he thought about farting and giving off a deep, long manly belch and growing to bigger sizes
<br />
'Don't think like that- I need to get this fixed' he mentally chided himself.
<br />

<br />
&quot;So what am I supposed to do?&quot;  John looked up at Cliff
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well...&quot;</p>
