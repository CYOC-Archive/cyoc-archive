<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hm, pops seems to be away.&quot;, Mary Ann said to herself when noone replied to her call. &quot;But anyway, you seem to have regained your appetite. Good girl!&quot; Jeff was less happy. The slob tasted horrible and only his sense of survival helped overcome his repulsion. But Mary Ann was too much in thoughts to note how miserable her price sow looked. &quot;Still. What do I do if there&#39;s somethin wrong with you on the day of the competition. No. We need a back-up. I&#39;ll ask Dad if I can get two of his sows and prepare them as back-up for you!&quot; Jenny paid little attention to this, still focussed on his slob. The evil voice, however, got his attention immediately when it chimed in with Mary Ann in his head: &quot;Oh, and I am sure we all know what Mary Ann will do to pigs who do not partake in the competition. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be handed over to Dad for butchering even before the competition starts. I have a splendid idea. Why don&#39;t we have some people you know join the game? Prepare for a surprise, piggy!&quot; Jeff wondered what this meant. Obviously the voice intended to make people he knew parties to this horror. But who would it be? <br />
<br />
Mary Ann meanwhile had left and Jeff was alone in his sty. After a while he felt a pressure in his rump and carefully he arched his back as he had seen the female pigs in his former barn do and too a good shit. It felt so odd, even odder though was the feeling of peeing from his newly acquired vagina. Still worse was that he was still covered in mud after his previous quarrel with Mary Ann. And his mouth was rake with the foul taste of the slob. Oh god, he hated this. Still, there was nothing he could do now, so he hesitantly laid down in the mud - what did it matter, given his dirty state? - and fell asleep. But his sleep was all but relaxing. He dreamt of the competition and saw himself presented to the judges. But then the prizes were awarded and the neighbour pig won. In his dream he saw Mary Ann&#39;s face distort, tears streaming down her cheeks. And then, back at the farm, he saw himself. In his dream he heard Mary Ann say: &quot;She&#39;s yours Pops. I hope she makes at least some good ham and bacon.&quot; And then there he was, in a white tiled room, Mary Ann&#39;s dad with a white apron and some weird instrument in his hand, looking like giant scissors. Mary Ann stood at the side and nodded to her dad: &quot;Just do it, dad. The loser deserves nothing better.&quot; Then suddenly the instrument snaps around his head and he feels an electric current run through his body. He feels himself spasm, shit and urine running out uncontrollably. Then his body is hoisted by his hind legs and Jeff sees, now from an outside perspective, how his throat is cut. But it is not Pops but Mary Ann, with a cold glare on her face. He saw his pig body bleed out, the bload running into a plastic bucket. Next Mary Ann lowered his body into a metal machine where it was treated with hot water and metal brushes. Out came a clean pink pig body, completely dehaired. Mary Ann scrabbed off a few reamining hairs with a knife before using the knife to cut off his ear gristles and his eyes which she discarded into a dust bin. At this point Jeff&#39;s pig body in the sty twitched and sweated but he did not wake up. In his dream he now saw Mary Ann put hooks through his hind legs and raise the pig body. She then hoisted the body up again and began to cut open his belly. With a quick cut she circumcised his butthole and pussy, so his intestines could freely fall from his body. Taking them out, Mary Ann qucikly looked at the pussy and remarked to her dad: &quot;She could have made a good breeder, I guess. Oh had she just won.&quot; Her dad replied: &quot;Guess so. But I mean ultimately even the old breeders end here. And her meat looks delicious. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll taste great, so don&#39;t be sad anymore, Darling.&quot; Mary Ann agreed: &quot;I&#39;m not said about her. You know that I&#39;m not too affectionate towards the pigs. I&#39;m just annoyed I did not win.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s my girl. So let&#39;s see we get this little loser worked into sausages and hams. And be careful when taking out the bowels, don&#39;t let feces spill on the meat.&quot; &quot; I won&#39;t, I#ll put a clamp on the butthole!&quot; Jeff could then see Mary Ann put a plastic clmap around his bowels just below his butthole, then putting the bowels into metal pans, one for his bowels, one for his heart, liver and lungs. When his body was no more than an empty shell, she took a large sort of electric saw and cut it into two, his brains following into then pan with his heart and liver. She then put the body halves into a clod storage, turning to his organs. He could see her clean his red organs and store them in the freezer as well. Next followed his bowels. Mary Ann carefully stretched them out, squeezing the shit from them and strapping off any slime so that all that remained was thin fabric. These she wrapped up on plastic nozzles, ready to serve as sausage casing. They also went into the freezer, while Pops dropped in and he and Mary Ann returned their attention to his meat. They took the halves and cut them into their parts. There were hams and shoulders, head, bacon sides and filets. He saw his hams seasoned and put in a smoking chamber as did some of his bacon. His head was cooked, toegther with his tongue, to become head cheese. His shoulders became cooked hams while the fattier parts of his meat were gorund up and spiced, together with hear, liver, lung and kidneys. These were then pushed into his former bowels to make all kinds of thick and thin sausages. Some of the best parts such as the filets were kept fresh for barbequeing. What was ultimately left were his ears, his nose tip and some bones which would probably go to the dogs. When his body was entirely worked into meat products, Mary Ann and her dad gave high fives and he heard Mary Ann say: &quot;Even a loser pig may still make some good ham, so it&#39;s not a waste anyhow.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly woke up, realizing that Mary Ann was standing next to his sty, the last words obviously no longer part of his horrible dream but adressed to her dead who was standing next to her. The burly farmer nodded and Mary Ann at this opened the gate to his sty, leading in to pigs. Immediately they started to grant and Jeff was stunned to find that their grunts sounded like speech to him. And he was even more shocked when he recognized the pigs voices. It was ...</p>
