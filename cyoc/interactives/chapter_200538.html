<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘You want to be 18 again?’ Asked Sonya of Derek, her former boyfriend, now changed into a 7 year old girl.<br />
<br />
‘Yeah I think so. Your Mum will be finishing work soon. We need to be ourselves again before she comes home’<br />
<br />
‘She will be an hour yet. I want to try some things out’ She placed the collar around Derek’s neck and fastened it. Then stood back and studied the little girl.<br />
<br />
‘I want you to grow up until you are 18 and your clothes should change to suit your adult body’<br />
<br />
Derek felt herself growing taller and was momentarily relieved to see that the collar was still working, however she quickly realised that not everything was changing. Derek continued to wear the blue dress although it did change as Derek went through puberty – female puberty. The dress developed a bodice that could accommodate her now ample cleavage. Derek realised she was now also wearing a bra.<br />
<br />
‘What have you done!’ Derek complained in a feminine voice.<br />
<br />
‘I have made you 18. That’s what you asked for. Don’t you want to see what a pretty young woman you have become?’<br />
<br />
‘I wanted to be myself’<br />
<br />
‘But you are yourself. Just a female version of yourself’ declared the still adult Sonya.<br />
<br />
‘I wanted to be male’<br />
<br />
‘No! I thought you enjoyed being a girl’<br />
<br />
Derek somehow felt herself compelled to say ‘I do’<br />
<br />
‘Then you will be happy to stay as an 18 year old girl for the time being. I want to have a fashion show’ Derek was instantly compelled to be happy as she was.<br />
<br />
Derek looked at her reflection in the mirror. She still had recognisably her eyes and face, just the feminised version. She was actually quite pretty<br />
<br />
Sonya picked up the Vogue magazine ‘So I just find an outfit and imagine you wearing it’ <br />
<br />
‘That’s what I did before’ Derek replied.<br />
<br />
‘What do you think of this dress?’ <br />
<br />
It actually didn’t matter what Derek thought of the dresses. She found herself wearing at least half a dozen different outfits and after another command from Sonya found herself mimicking a runway fashion model. She marched up and down the hallway. Derek was amazed that she had no problem walking in the high heels that Sonya must have imagined onto her feet. Derek had not heard such an instruction but had learnt that Sonya did not actually have to verbalise commands to make her obey.<br />
<br />
‘This is fantastic!’ Sonya declared. Derek looked at herself in the mirror. She had just modelled a long red silk gown that was worn by Jennifer Lawrence in the magazine – A face Derek did recognise. ‘I think I need to make you taller though. I’m afraid Darlene is a bit height challenged to be a fashion model. You couldn’t be more than about 5’4’<br />
<br />
Derek felt herself growing taller, soon she was towering over Sonya, who in her mother’s body, Derek knew to be about 6 ft tall. ‘Whoa! How tall are you making me?’<br />
<br />
‘I want to see how these clothes would fit on my own body. You are now 6’3, my real height. It’s just I don’t normally wear heels as I’m tall enough without them’ Derek looked down at the red heels she could now see on her feet. They had at least three inch heels making her 6’6.<br />
<br />
‘I feel like I’m a giant’<br />
<br />
‘Welcome to my world’<br />
<br />
Derek watched in the mirror as her dress morphed once more. She soon found herself wearing a sequinned gold dress, with a split up the side that showed off her now enormously long legs. Derek had to admit she was absolutely stunning. One glance at the magazine showed a picture of Jennifer Lawrence wearing the very same dress. As she was compelled to do she walked to the lounge and back modelling the outfit for Sonya.<br />
<br />
However Sonya was still not satisfied. She decided to change Derek further. Derek returned from modelling the gold dress to see in the mirror that the girl wearing that dress now had Sonya’s own face. <br />
<br />
‘What now?’ It was Sonya’s voice that came out of her mouth. <br />
<br />
‘I want to see what that dress looks like on me’<br />
<br />
‘Dare I say sexy’ Derek replied<br />
<br />
‘I have to agree. I didn’t realise how stunning I was’ commented Sonya. Derek continued to look at her reflection in the mirror as her hair changed to all the colours of the rainbow. <br />
<br />
‘I think I like myself best as a blonde’ The real Sonya declared. Derek watched as her now blonde hair gained a wave<br />
<br />
‘That’s your natural colour’ Derek reminded her<br />
<br />
‘I think I was too busy trying to make myself look like an individual. I don’t need the zany hair colour. My height makes me individual enough’<br />
<br />
Derek wasn’t going to argue that point. ‘So are you going to go back to being a blonde?’<br />
<br />
‘I think so’ Sonya stood up and went to her own wardrobe. ‘Do me a favour and put this on. It’s the dress I planned to wear to your Mum’s dinner. I want to see how it looks’<br />
<br />
‘Can’t you just imagine it onto me’<br />
<br />
‘No I want to see how the real thing looks. If I imagine it I would fix any flaws’<br />
<br />
Under Sonya’s instructions Derek put on the clothes Sonya had been planning to wear to the restaurant that night. Sonya made Derek don some of her underwear first then put on a knee length, red dress with a white flower print. She matched that with flat red shoes. Because of her height Sonya rarely wore heels. Derek put on these clothes without complaint. Sonya’s earlier command had made her happy to be a young woman and she was compelled to obey Sonya&#39;s wishes. The gold dress and heels had vanished as soon as Derek took them off.<br />
<br />
Sonya did cheat and imagined make-up onto Derek’s face. She experimented with several lipstick colours, settling for a light brown shade. ‘I like it’ Sonya declared as she allowed Derek to see her reflection. ‘Let me remove the collar though. It doesn’t go with the dress’ <br />
<br />
So Derek was a blonde Sonya without the collar on once more modelling the dress with a walk down to the lounge and back. Still under the compulsion Sonya had put on her earlier she wiggled her bum like a fashion model as she walked. Sonya was very satisfied with what would be her knew look. The garment certainly wasn’t as fashionable as the designer gowns from the magazine but Sonya thought that Derek was quite pretty all the same.</p>
