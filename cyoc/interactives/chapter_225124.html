<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They woke up the next morning, Scott still spooning John. Another monday. This time though, this was probably the last monday of their lives that they&#39;d have to work. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, so, John, important question… are these mental changes reversible? Like, if I make someone believe something, will that remain even after you remove the spell from me?&quot; Scott whispered into John&#39;s ear. John reached into his wizard knowledge, responding moments later. &quot;For a long time, yeah. Magic will reside in the people you&#39;ve changed anywhere between a month or a couple of years.&quot;<br />
<br />
H-holy shit. That might be bad. &quot;Um, is there any way to revert those changes? Say, if I changed anything about you?&quot; Scott awkwardly retracted from his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
John thought for a moment, looking for anything out of place in his mind that could possibly have been changed, coming short with any ideas. &quot;There are some ways, yeah. I could do a broader removal spell, but that&#39;s a little bit intimidating because I&#39;d likely be removing the robe&#39;s effect on me as well, so, it&#39;s possible I wouldn&#39;t be able to do magic for a while even with the robe. There&#39;s also the option of trying to fish out specific magic interference, but I&#39;d have to know what you changed about me in order to be able to remove those spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott sighed, relieved that his boyfriend would be fine. &quot;What about the others I changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have to know who they were, meet them in person, dispell them in person… It&#39;s a lot of work.&quot; John shrugged. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So… this is kind of embarrassing, but you really can&#39;t tell what I changed about you?&quot; Scott put his hand on the hare&#39;s abs and tickled them, getting a few giggles out of the lagomorph as he instinctively kicked his right paw.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-not really, no… I assume it&#39;s something to do with fetishes, though. I don&#39;t remember being so turned on whenever I&#39;m around you, if I&#39;m honest.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying that I wasn&#39;t sexy before, my little easter bunny?&quot; Scott growled playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, you were, it&#39;s just… maybe you made me like you more, I guess.&quot; John reached out for the hand tickling his chest. Holding it, he felt… peaceful. This tanuki calmed him, made him feel safe, made him feel…<br />
<br />
&quot;Case in point, Scott, I have a fucking boner again. Fess up, what&#39;d you do?&quot; John looked into Scott&#39;s eyes. Whoa. <br />
<br />
&quot;I innocently said that, uhh… how do I say something without changing your brain again?&quot; Scott&#39;s heart recoiled, intimidated by the uncommon gesture from John.<br />
<br />
Reaching for his wand, John unleashed another pulse of magic throughout the room as he pressed the wand into the tanuki&#39;s snoot. &quot;Will it. You can now toggle it on and off.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trying to focus on disabling the spell, he heard a click as his throat vibrated pleasantly for a few moments. &quot;I, uh… w-well, I made you really like the smell of my balls? Like, really really like?&quot; Scott cupped his crotch before rubbing the same hand into John&#39;s muzzle. John collapsed into a stuttering mess as he dropped the wand, the aphrodisiac smell of the tanuki&#39;s balls turning his nose into an erogenous zone as his shaft stood fully erect. He rolled around for a minute and a half before Scott wiped his nose with a wet napkin, laughing like crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s why you&#39;ve been erect whenever you&#39;re around me. Got huge, musky balls, so… wide area of effect.&quot; He smiled earnestly, closing his eyes. He felt a sudden kick into his belly as two strong paws crashed into it, knocking the wind out of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Asshole. Anything else?&quot; John picked up the wand, pointing it at his own head as the stick glowed, extracting a spell from his mind. His shaft grew softer.<br />
<br />
Coughing, Scott elected to shake his head and not talk about any other changes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; John said stoically, finally looking away from Scott&#39;s eyes as his shoulders slumped forward, tension releasing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it really that bad? I thought we&#39;ve laid down some ground rules, this feels like it should fit within them.&quot; Scott spoke timidly, afraid of having hurt his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine, but… ugh, it&#39;s confusing. Dubious consent is okay, I just want to be aware that what&#39;s happening is just the two of us playing around, okay? The rules were made for when we&#39;re, you know, being kinky with one another, not for daily life.&quot; John put the wand into his robe, instinctively knowing where the pockets were even as the robe was concealed by magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were having sex, like, constantly yesterday.&quot; Scott grumbled, disagreeing with the point. &quot;When we&#39;re in suit, we ARE being kinky, aren&#39;t we?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
John scratched behind his itchy ears as he thought of a reply. &quot;I&#39;d like it if we were able to be… not kinky, while we&#39;re in suit, given how the two of us have made plans to LITERALLY find another life in these costumes.&quot; <br />
<br />
The alarm clock rang. The two of them should be leaving the house soon if they wanted to get to work. Hitting the clock with his large hand, Scott stopped the annoying ringing as he looked at his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve had plenty of moments yesterday where we just lived a normal life, too. I don&#39;t get it, John, sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it&#39;s just… ugh, something is telling me something was wrong, okay? I don&#39;t know why.&quot; John crossed his arms, sinking further into the bed. &quot;I was expecting the day to go normally, casually, innocently, and then you changed my mind so that I&#39;d be horny the whole time I&#39;m around you. It&#39;s a difference in expectations.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So… if you were expecting everything to be kinky, you would be fine with everything?&quot; Scott stood up, walking around the bed until he was in front of John.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so, yeah.&quot; John shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then expect it to be very kinky, bun.&quot; Scott grinned as he picked up one of John&#39;s legs, putting the hare&#39;s paw up to his face and giving it a good lick before letting it fall back down to the bed.<br />
<br />
Scott&#39;s throat rumbled as he willed the spell to reactivate. A few moments later, the two of them were having breakfast in the kitchen. Another few moments later, they found themselves in the middle of their office as the two of them teleported. No one seemed to notice, nor pay any of them any unusual mind. A few coworkers waved and gave their greetings as they always did, unbothered by John and Scott being large anthros. Some stared at Scott&#39;s crotch for longer than comfortable, but didn&#39;t comment anything on his nudity. Noticing the attention, the tanuki rubbed his shaft as he showed off his body to the staring onlookers, getting blushes out of them as they turned away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel really fucking good, showing myself off like that with everyone thinking it&#39;s the normalest thing.&quot; Scott rumbled happily as he ruffled his boyfriend&#39;s fluffy head. &quot;It&#39;s more-so about the space, I guess. I&#39;ve spent years of my life here living a mundane existence, and now I can come in naked and show my cock off to all of my coworkers. I didn&#39;t know there were so many gay dudes here.&quot; Scott continued monologuing as the two of them walked to their boss&#39;s office. &quot;You figure out what you wanna do with the boss?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Course! Going to do what I do best - sell costumes.&quot; John nodded. &quot;Stuffed a costume into my robe while you weren&#39;t looking. I&#39;ll take care of his physical form, and then you can decide what to do with his personality.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two of them made it. Stepping into the office, they were immediately greeted with the scowl of their boss Thomas. The duo hated Thomas. Mister Ervington was a fucking dick, constantly getting on their case for the most minute of shit even as the two of them raked in customers one after another. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re six minutes late.&quot; Thomas said judgmentally, clicking his pen as he pretended to work on some papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;We got stuck in traffic.&quot; John said bitterly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, really? That&#39;s strange, I don&#39;t see your car in the lot.&quot; Tom said sarcastically, not even turning to look in the window. &quot;You crawl here, John? Ran out of gas?&quot; <br />
<br />
Swallowing, John responded with a polite tone. &quot;Mister Ervington, I&#39;m sorry for being late. I was actually wondering, with the Halloween party coming up, if you were interested in borrowing a suit from us.&quot; He turned around, reaching into his robe and pulling out a diminutive fox costume.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not interested in your furry shit, John, I&#39;m interested in the deal we have with Tenco, a representative of theirs will be here in about half an hour in the second conference room. I want you to work your magic on them and then stop fucking bothering me for the rest of the day.&quot; Thomas put the pen down, looking at the furry men before him. <br />
<br />
&quot;B-but-.&quot; John stammered, unable to find anything to say to convince Thomas. Can&#39;t sell something to someone who doesn&#39;t want it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got your orders, John, get the fuck on with them.&quot; Thomas shouted, turning his gaze towards Scott, waiting for him to say his apology as well. <br />
<br />
Scott felt like he was slowly putting on Joker makeup while this was going on. He was so sick of Thomas. He crossed his arms, pronouncing every word with intent as they burrowed their way into Thomas&#39; mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Ervington, sir, you feel rather calm, don&#39;t you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ervington nodded, adjusting his suit. &quot;As calm as I can be with the two of you always fucking everything up, Scott.&quot; He sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The deal will go fine, you shouldn&#39;t worry about that. You should worry about how you&#39;ve been treating my boyfriend here. You&#39;ve been making him feel rather uncomfortable, you know that, right?&quot; Scott wrapped his arm around John, pulling him in for a protective hug.<br />
<br />
Thomas spoke calmly, explaining himself to the tanuki: &quot;I know that I&#39;ve been making him feel uncomfortable, Scott, that&#39;s the whole fucking point. He fucks up, just like you, so I reprimand the two of you faggots as I should.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott wagged his finger. &quot;Mister Ervington, but that&#39;s precisely what you shouldn&#39;t do. My sweet bunny made so many deals over the years, and you&#39;ve never once praised him. When he made mistakes, they were most often insignificant but you always blew them way out of proportion.&quot; Bitter tone in his voice, Scott felt so happy to just finally be able to talk back in any way to his boss.<br />
<br />
Magic flooded over Thomas as the statements took root within him, slowly making him more malleable to further changes. &quot;Scott… What&#39;s your point? Someone fucks up, I should just coddle them like a child? Kiss them on their lazy fucking asses for cutting corners?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You should stop raising your voice, for one. You already hold authority over everyone in the office, there&#39;s no need to verbally assault anyone.&quot; Scott stared into his boss&#39; eyes with disdain.<br />
<br />
Thomas coughed as his mind stirred. &quot;Scott, if I don&#39;t show who&#39;s-.&quot; He was interrupted by the tanuki&#39;s assertive voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone knows you&#39;re boss, Thomas. You don&#39;t need to yell at anyone. You can make them listen without shouting.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thomas clicked the pen as his mind finished reconfiguring itself. &quot;Fine, Scott, you&#39;re right. Is that everything you wanted to say? I&#39;m fucking busy.&quot; He said with a voice that lacked the edge Scott was so accustomed to hearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should apologize to John, too. He didn&#39;t do anything to deserve how you treated him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thomas felt a pang of guilt as the large tanuki spoke. He agreed, deep down, but didn&#39;t want to lose face. &quot;I&#39;m not apologizing to you two faggots. What&#39;s done is done, move on.&quot; He waved them off before looking down at his papers.<br />
<br />
Scott was really fucking upset. Tom was so stubborn that he could just shrug off the spell? The tanuki was going to break that oaf. <br />
<br />
&quot;You really like the word faggot, don&#39;t you sir?&quot; Scott said with acid in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess. Describes you two lovebirds well.&quot; Thomas smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love being called a faggot too, don&#39;t you?&quot; Scott let John out of his grasp and walked over to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what? No, Scott, I don&#39;t…&quot; Tom said reproachingly. The fuck was Scott up to? He finally forget his place?<br />
<br />
&quot;You love being called a faggot, Tom. You love it when larger, more masculine men call you a dirty little faggot.&quot; Scott said, putting his arms on Tom&#39;s shoulders. Tom felt himself growing erect. He was confused, he wasn&#39;t a-. <br />
<br />
Seeing hesitation on his boss&#39; eyes, he leaned over and whispered into his ears. <br />
&quot;You love being called a faggot, Tom. You&#39;re a submissive little homosexual who LOVES when he&#39;s called names.&quot; <br />
<br />
Forcing his erection down with his hand, Tom hesitantly shook his head. Scott dug his claws into Thomas, insistingly saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a bottom, Tom. You love large men. Inside of you. In every hole.&quot; <br />
<br />
The walls cracked. Tom&#39;s memories were rewritten as he remembered a whole new life, full of larger men using him as a toy while humiliating him with all sorts of words. He shifted his legs uncomfortably, looking at Scott in a new, lustful light.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I guess, s-sir… y-you&#39;re right.&quot; Tom said with timidity that Scott was unaccustomed to hearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, will you apologize to my boyfriend, you little faggot?&quot; Scott&#39;s voice did not soften. <br />
<br />
Blushing, Thomas continued to stir in his seat. He looked past Scott at John&#39;s happy face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for how I treated you, John. I didn&#39;t mean it.&quot; Thomas said genuinely, sighing as he rubbed his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you didn&#39;t, not anymore.&quot; John nodded. &quot;Would you like to talk about the costume again? You could apologize to everyone else at the party, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas looked at the costume with confusion. He was more open to the idea now, but… <br />
<br />
&quot;Mister Ervington, the costume is rather provocative, I&#39;m sure people would pay all kinds of attention to you…&quot; John said, his voice taking on the persuasive cheeriness that got him so many sales in the past.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I-I…&quot; Thomas stammered as he listened. Much more open to the idea now…<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you&#39;re worried about size… all my costumes are form-fitting, and even if it&#39;s slightly small, it&#39;ll just show off your physique all the better.&quot; John&#39;s voice took on a more playful tone towards the end of the sentence.<br />
<br />
Thomas gulped. Very open to the idea now… he nodded meekly.<br />
<br />
Scott jumped on the train. &quot;Now, puppy, Halloween is not for a few days… but you should put on the costume right now and see how it fits.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thomas mounted one last stand as the two men played him like a fiddle. &quot;S-surely you d-don&#39;t expect me to put it in f-front of you two, r-right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott walked behind the table, rubbing Thomas&#39; shoulders. &quot;We do… you wouldn&#39;t mind undressing for us, right, kitten?&quot; <br />
<br />
Breathing out unevenly, Thomas stood up from his chair, a bulge in his pants making John giggle involuntarily. The hare really enjoyed seeing his boyfriend push his boss around.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-could you please t-turn around…&quot; Thomas said meekly. &quot;It&#39;s really embarrassing to do it i-in front of you two, of all people…&quot; <br />
<br />
Unzipping Tom&#39;s pants, Scott finally relaxed a little bit, content with the scenario. &quot;You haven&#39;t apologized to ME, you know. You really want to give Daddy a good show to make me feel better, right, slut?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom nodded as he needily removed his pants and underwear, his shaft feeling uncomfortable in the constraining fabric. Scott gulped as he saw a 6&quot; cock on the toned man&#39;s shaven crotch. Damn, Tom was girthy. Never would&#39;ve guessed. It doesn&#39;t compare to the tanuki&#39;s footlong, but it&#39;s very impressive nonetheless. For a human.<br />
<br />
Tom turned around to face Daddy, unbuttoning his shirt with one hand as the other one moved across the tanuki&#39;s belly. Tom blushed as he felt up the firm gut, feeling insignificant next to the giant tanuki. He didn&#39;t even come up to the man&#39;s tits, that&#39;s how tall the tanuki was in comparison. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I always wanted to do this… you look so good, Sir…&quot; Tom whispered as he finished taking off his shirt, revealing a perfectly average body. Nothing to write home about.<br />
<br />
John coughed, interrupting the two men. &quot;Costume.&quot; He walked over with the anthro fox suit, unzipping the back as he invited Tom to step into the bright orange and white body. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s tiny…&quot; Tom said, looking at the 4&#39;3&quot; hollow fox costume.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll stretch, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Scott said, giving Tom a light spank. The boss yelped, but felt his reservations vanish as the words took hold. Yeah, it&#39;ll stretch. Stepping into the costume, he felt his body surrounded by the comforting softness of the fur. It was a tight fit, and it felt constraining in places (especially his crotch), but he was impressed that he could actually put it on. Hearing a zipper behind him, Tom felt vertigo as he sat down on a chair, grabbing unto his muzzle… muzzle… muzzle?! Opening his eyes, the room seemed much larger as he felt up his face, the vulpine muzzle obscuring the bottom of his vision. The colors in the room seemed much sharper, the smells were richer, and… g-god, he was so fluffy… rubbing his paws all over himself, he was shocked by the majestic feeling of his new coat of fur. He wagged his tail mindlessly, one hand reaching to stroke his sheath. <br />
<br />
Scott looked on, confused. &quot;The fox is taking it well.&quot; <br />
<br />
John replied innocently: &quot;Put some spells on the costume. Guy&#39;s reality is adjusting so that he was always a happy, horny fox. Everyone but the two of us will remember him that way, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott nodded. &quot;So… no one remembers Tom abusing them?&quot; He made the connection, somewhat content with the outcome. <br />
<br />
John felt a wave wash over him as Scott&#39;s words sank into him. &quot;What are you talking about? Tom never hurt a fly.&quot; Memories of abuse faded from his mind, making John feel slightly saner.<br />
<br />
Scott slapped himself on the face before nodding. &quot;I know... I guess… Want to make Tom a better boss? I have an idea of what a happy, horny fox could do for the office.&quot; <br />
<br />
John shrugged, letting Scott have free reign.<br />
<br />
By now, Thomas came on his own chest. His fluff made him look average, but underneath all the fur Tom was a twig. His 3&quot; stood firm as he saw Daddy&#39;s shadow looming over him before looking up into his grinning face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say you could cum, pancake. You know you can&#39;t cum unless I tell you so, right?&quot; The tanuki sounded angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yip?!.. I-I&#39;m sorry, Sir, I just got really excited an-.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No excuses, slut. You fuck up, you get punished by your master. As you should be.&quot; Scott sighed, enjoying the role reversal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got a new assignment for you. Office morale has been down recently. You&#39;re going to help your workers with their assignments wherever possible. And you&#39;re going to help them take care of their urges. Distractions are bad for productivity, as you&#39;ve often said, so you&#39;re going to help your employees take care of their distractions. You&#39;ll suck them off, sit in their lap and ride them, rim them, whatever, until they cum. And you&#39;ll lap that cum off, since a messy workspace is bad for productivity as well.&quot; Scott changed Tom&#39;s whole identity like it was nothing.<br />
<br />
John jumped in on the train, pulling out a wand, casting a series of spells. Whenever someone was in suit, that&#39;s when he could control them best. He could do practically anything to Tom. &quot;Everyone will think that it&#39;s normal for you to help your employees get off. Making your workers cum makes you happy. After all, you&#39;re addicted to cum. You can&#39;t digest anything else. The more cum you&#39;re filled with, the happier and hornier you are. You&#39;re also really light, so much so that anyone in the office could carry you by just your tail. The only thing keeping you from floating through the air is cum, so, the longer you go without a fill, the closer you are to flying like a balloon until you can&#39;t move yourself at all, just floating towards the ceiling.&quot; As a finisher, John flicked his wand as a zipper flew from behind Tom and onto the floor, seam closing forever. <br />
<br />
Tom felt confused by his workers describing him. Normal people don&#39;t just list off everything about you. Still, maybe he was-. Tom&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by the onset sensation of lightness. Shit, when was the last time he sucked someone off? And he just HAD to cum a few minutes ago, as well. Air trapped itself between his fur and lifted him into the air. Fuck, fuck, it&#39;s probably an hour before he was inanimate. He needed a fill, now.<br />
<br />
It looked kinda funny, the duo thought. The fox grabbed the couch with his hands as the rest of his body gravitated towards the ceiling. The fox&#39;s legs kicked in the air as he softly climbed downwards towards the bottom of the couch with his claws, then heeled his paws into the little space between the chair and the floor, pinning himself down to the ground as he turned from an Australian fox into a regular British fox, finally positioning himself upward. He kept sitting on his knees, paws wedged below the chair, as he pointed with a claw towards the crotches of the men in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mind helping me, um, fill up, lads? I need to get moving to help the guys on the floor…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know what, Tom,&quot; John said, pulling on Scott&#39;s arm, &quot;we have a meeting with a Tenco representative in like 5 minutes, we need to be on top of that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Scott grabbed the fox by a shoulder, easily pulling him from under the couch. Holy shit, he WAS like a balloon. Holding his ear in-between his fingers, he could completely move the fox&#39;s body. He rotated the fox a few times, getting a few dizzy yips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not gonna get a promotion like that, Daddy... H-help me out, w-won&#39;t you?&quot; Tom said, feeling completely insignificant in his employee&#39;s firm paw. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll help you out, Mister Ervington. I&#39;ll toss you out into the common space, maybe someone will pick you up.&quot; Scott led John and Thomas out of Tom&#39;s office, holding the lightweight fox by the tail as he floated in the air, arms crossed.<br />
<br />
Scott tossed the fox to the first male employee they saw, ordering them to &quot;deflate the traffic cone&quot;. Making their way to the conference room, the duo giggled as they talked about what they did. They tried to figure out what they should do next.</p>
