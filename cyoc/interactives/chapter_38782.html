<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night, Prince and Peter continued talking...<br />
&quot;Peter, I think Salvador should move to Dustin's home and start living with you. He must start practising his wizard abilities.&quot; Prince said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about his parents?&quot; Peter said. He was still transformed into Superman. The 15 years old was now a super-muscular grown up adult with superpowers. He was even taller and wider than Prince.<br />
<br />
&quot;Salvador's parents died when he was only a baby. He lives on a orphanage now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor kid...&quot; Peter said as he returned to his normal size and his clothes became normal again.<br />
<br />
Next day, when Peter got home from school, before he could leave his backpack on the ground, Prince and Salvador suddenly appeared on Dustin's home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master!&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Salvador, please take a seat.&quot; Prince said pointing to the sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Peter! Prince was waiting for me on the orphanage! He's very cool!&quot; Salvador said smiling.<br />
<br />
Both boys sat on the sofa, and Prince started to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Salvador, yesterday you demonstrated that you will be a very powerful wizard.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, master.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a reward for your courage, I'm going to make you a proposition.&quot; Prince said. &quot;I want Peter as my successor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? Really? ME!?&quot; Peter said excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Peter, calm down. You are my most powerful transformation wizard, you deserve it. But don't worry, because you are still very young and you must enjoy your younghood until the day you become the Wizard Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, master.&quot; Peter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as the Wizard Master heir, you need a protector. Salvador will be your protector.&quot; Prince said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? I'd like to do it, but I still don't have my own powers.&quot; Salvador said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can easily fix that. However, before you accept it, you must know that your life will change radically. Being the heir's protector is not an easy thing, I'll try to make it easier to you.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Salvador asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... First of all, Salvador you will move to Dustin's home and start living here.&quot;<br />
&quot;No problem! I'd love to live here with Peter!&quot; Salvador said excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but there's even more. You two will become REAL brothers.&quot; Prince said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? THANK YOU!!!&quot; Salvador started to cry. He was very happy, he was going to get a big brother. Prince and Peter smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I must tell you that your body will need some changes. The heir's protector looks different from any wizard and he wears a different clothing.&quot; Prince continued<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be a monster or something like that?&quot; Salvador said cleaning his tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You will still look like a human, but you will be different. And you will be able to transform yourself into the boy you are now whenever want. Maybe you won't like to go to school as the heir's protector. But when you are alone with Peter, you will have to return to your heir's protector body.&quot; Prince said. Peter knew about wizard's protectors and knew how Salvador was going to look after the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care about how I will look. My big brother Peter is going to be the Wizard Master, and I must protect him.&quot; Salvador said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And finally... Peter, you will lose your powers for a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know.&quot; Peter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your powers will be given to your protector for a month. Then he will be able to protect you and prove that he can do it. Salvador, are you sure? Do you want all these things to happen?&quot; Prince said. &quot;I don't want to force you, you are free to continue your normal human life if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Salvador knew that his life was going to be very different from now on. But he loved the idea of being the heir's protector, it was like a dream to have a job like that. Not only that, but also he was going to get a brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; he said finally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then. Peter, come here.&quot; Prince said. Peter walked to Prince, then his master placed his right hand over the boy’s forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I now pronounce you my heir. You will be the future Wizard Master.&quot; he said and a white flash light blinded Peter.<br />
<br />
He tried to open his eyes, but he was unable to do it. He was scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Salvador! Are you there!? Where are you!?&quot; he screamed.<br />
<br />
After some seconds, Peter's eyes opened magically. All he could see was Dustin's home. It looked the same, there were no changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter. I'm here.&quot; a voice sounded behind Peter.<br />
<br />
Peter turned and saw something incredible.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me, Salvador.&quot; a man smiled.<br />
<br />
In front of Peter there was a huge black man. Salvador was now an adult, or at least he looked like an adult. His skin changed from brown to black, Peter knew how wizard's protectors looked so he quickly understood why Salvador changed so much. Salvador had a huge muscular body, he seemed a professional wrestler. He did some poses smiling, Peter noticed that his biceps were like bowling balls. Finally, Peter looked at Salvador's protector's costume. He was only wearing silver wristbands, briefs and boots. The rest of his body was naked. Peter noticed that Salvador's manhood was enhanced too, a huge bulge was sticking out on his briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprised? I have been training with Prince. It has been a year since I was here in your house. Well, OUR home.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A month? I was blinded for some seconds!&quot; Peter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Prince stopped time for me, now I have your powers. In a month you will be able to recover your powers and you will even get more powerful. For now, I'll protect you this month. Everything you need, you must simply call me in your mind, and I'll help you. I'm your little brother, but I'm also your loyal servant and protector.&quot; Salvador said. He looked more adult, but also he acted like an adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Salvador.&quot; Peter said. Then he smiled and tried to change the subject. &quot;Well... What do you think about your body? My protector could not look better!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! Yes! I love it! And guess what? I decided to stay like this forever! Everyone at school will still recognize me. In fact, Prince told me that I'm still a kid, I'm not really an adult.&quot; Salvador laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool! So I'm a 15 years old boy, my little brother is a black man, bigger and more muscular than me who wears silver briefs, looks like a professional wrestler and takes care of me. Dude, school is going to be very fun!&quot; Peter said.<br />
<br />
Then someone opened the door. It was Ty. He asked Peter who was that man, and his cousin explained everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and he is my little big brother.&quot; Peter said, and hugged the big man who was now his little brother!</p>
