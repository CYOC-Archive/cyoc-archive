<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Life was very different for Brad now that he was a grown up.<br />
<br />
For one, his perception of the world had totally changed. He could look at television and be immediately put off by children&#39;s cartoons, but found an automatic interest in sports. He experimented with TV by landing himself on a news channel talking about finance and realized he understood every word. <br />
<br />
Just a few days ago, he was playing with blocks. He was fingerpainting. He wanted to be a big adult more than anything, and now he was. It was like becoming a god in many ways, all the instant information filtering through his brain, a new adult understanding of the world, and more than that, an adult body. <br />
<br />
He was a handsome white male, 35 years old, and had a good body. He knew how to keep it fit if he thought hard about it. He could picture the gym machines. His body was average. He had just enough muscle to give him definition, but he wasn&#39;t overly muscular. He had a nice deep stubble that he kept feeling. It was such a pleasurable sensation to have facial hair all of a sudden. <br />
<br />
He got naked his first night in his new room. He got a room all of his own, of course. Now that he was a grownup, such things were expected. He would go to work for Alan in a few days and he would be in the adult working world. A toddler thrown into the adult world with a new adult mind. Even though he understood things, he was experiencing them for the first time, and he was experiencing sensory overload looking at his new thick dick. The banana sized schlong bobbed in front of him. He couldn&#39;t believe how humungous it was! He gaped at it. He loved his new reflection: a confident and handsome man in his prime, with the beginnings of crags and laugh lines that were not too deep, just enough to give his face some definite character. He looked supremely confident smiling in the full length mirror at himself, his black hair looking perfect and suave. He practiced making several faces for quite some time before he remembered his new giant penis. He knew instinctually that he was 8 inches long, and that was above average, he knew. He was grateful. He had a dick most guys would kill for. <br />
<br />
It was a perfect size for fucking, he knew and he started thinking about sex stuff. He went on his new computer. He knew how an adult cock operated now. You had to pleasure yourself by stimulation. Getting his cock even harder by looking at hot guys. He found more than enough porn and found himself stroking his dick to photos of young high school jocks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yes,&quot; he whispered out loud, to no one. He wished there was some hot stud there sucking him off. He didn&#39;t really know what that felt like yet but he knew it felt good and that he craved it. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
David, now Sammy, heard his new Uncle Scott moaning from the other side of the hallway. Brad didn&#39;t realize how loud he was being, the new Sammy thought to himself. He was amused rather than anything, and he didn&#39;t know why. Typically it would horrify him to know what his brother was doing, especially since he was unable to do so himself. Instead, it felt natural and even funny to him. Brad, now Scott, moaned more and more, higher and more intense. <br />
<br />
He snuck out into the hallway outside Brad&#39;s door and cupped his ear to it. His new parents lived on the other side of the house, so he doubted they could hear this performance. He giggled. Uncle Scott sure did have a big weiner! Hey, how did he know that? He tried to remember what it looked like. Uncle Scott had a great big banana dick, that&#39;s what he liked to call it. He wanted to see it for himself, but he refrained from barging in. That&#39;s something little kids did and even though he was nine years old technically, he knew better than to interrupt a man when he was taking care of business. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Brad couldn&#39;t believe the sensations he was experiencing. It felt better than he could have imagined. The rush of euphoria around such a hard, large organ attached to him, which responded to every touch with overwhelming pleasure. His head was swimming thinking about younger teens, and especially the idea of plowing a much smaller younger man with his huge banana dick! <br />
<br />
Finally, the man cream erupted like a volcano. He remembered being in grade 5 and making a volcano. He was absorbing Scott&#39;s memories, he thought, since he had never experienced it himself. But he could still reference it, and he knew that he had a volcanic orgasm going. He gripped his dick with both hands and squeezed it and clenched his jaw and held his breath until a giant wad of man cum shot out of him and onto the floor. One two three four five strokes and then another spurt. Ten more slower strokes and he was cumming hard now. Uncontrollable. He couldn&#39;t help it. It felt SO fucking good! <br />
<br />
The torrent of cum that came out of him felt like a garden hose, the pumping hot liquid just flowed out of him until he was covered in a sticky pool of goo all over his stomach and legs. His girthy dick bobbed a few more moments before slightly deflating by an inch and a half. Funny how it got bigger and smaller! He sat back, proud of himself. He was a grown up! A man! He could do what daddy did now! He suddenly thought about the fact that his father could have orgasms, too, and that is how he had made his sons with his wife, by filling her up with man seed. <br />
<br />
Scott. I&#39;m Scott now. Not little Brad. I&#39;m Scott and I&#39;ve got a big dick, Brad thought. <br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a knock at his door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Scott? Are you okay in there? I heard you scream!&quot; David smiled and wore a shit eating grin. He heard Brad mumble and panic, telling him not to open the door. He quickly put on a T-shirt, some boxer shorts (new male attire he&#39;d never worn before!) and some sweatpants. He tried to answer the door casually. <br />
<br />
&quot;David. I mean. Sammy. What...what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I just heard you enjoying yourself. Did you find something good to jerk off to?&quot; Sammy&#39;s face smirked at him. <br />
<br />
Brad was overcome with embarrassment. He had never been embarrassed as a small child by anything but now he felt that he was somehow horribly in the wrong. He stammered an excuse and an apology before his new nephew started to crack up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever. I&#39;ll be doing it again in a few years. I&#39;m not really that innocent...UNCLE Scott.&quot; <br />
<br />
Scott shut his door without warning and locked it.  Sammy laughed out loud. <br />
<br />
The next day, Alan invited Scott to take a drive out through the countryside with him. Alan was a handsome man. They looked similar. They were brothers now, of course, and that would take some getting used to. Alan was wearing a T-shirt that highlighted his own musculature. He was 43 years old, 8 years Scott&#39;s senior and his hairline had receded a few inches more than Scott&#39;s. He was incredibly handsome, the new Scott thought. <br />
<br />
Oh shit, do I have the hots for my own brother? I hope he doesn&#39;t hate me if I do! <br />
<br />
They stopped near a trailhead. It was a sunny, beautiful day. <br />
<br />
&quot;There are a few secrets I need to tell you about our family,&quot; Alan admitted. &quot;Let&#39;s take a walk.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two men walked side by side. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how are you feeling?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Everything is so strange but good. It&#39;s a huge improvement. I&#39;m taller. How tall am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five foot eleven. Six feet if you wear the right shoes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Six feet tall, wow!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I imagine everything is going to be pretty...new,&quot; Alan said, distracted. They stopped in the middle of a field. There was no one around for miles. &quot;One of the things you need to know is that my brother and I...we&#39;re both gay. My wife Linda is a beard. She conceived Sammy in vitro. You know what that means?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It means...you didn&#39;t stick your dick inside her,&quot; Brad ventured. <br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. Can&#39;t stand women that way. Linda doesn&#39;t mind, she&#39;s a lesbian. Has a thing going on with one of the maids. You don&#39;t need to worry about that. My brother and I always had a thing going on but he liked younger men better than me. Lately, he&#39;d been paying more attention to Sammy than I liked. I asked Sammy about it and he hadn&#39;t noticed anything odd, but I could tell that my brother was looking at him that way. I realize this experiment has changed everything and that you two have new bodies but you&#39;re not the same people. I just hope you and I can come to an understanding here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s my brother. I would never hurt him. I mean, he&#39;s my nephew now. I&#39;m going to be a responsible adult, I assure you,&quot; Brad told him. He was able to act really mature now, he thought. Alan looked at him longingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;My brother and I had a falling out. I loved him but he betrayed me and he did it financially. I managed to keep anyone from finding out about it. I sold the assets he&#39;d purchased before it could do much damage, but he was hoping to make a profit and keep it all for himself. I didn&#39;t care if they investments were on their way up, they were too risky for our company. He knew that. So now he gets to grow up again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems kind of cruel, doesn&#39;t it? But then, I get his body and I really don&#39;t want to go back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You understand what I&#39;m telling you? I want you loyal to me. That&#39;s the only thing I ask for, Scott,&quot; Alan laid a hand on his arm and Brad moved forward to embrace his new brother, who unexpectedly kissed him on the lips. Alan felt his face, his stubble, his armpits and the two men rubbed their bodies against each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never...this feels amazing, Alan!&quot; He kissed the man deeply and passionately, the two men furiously making out for quite some time. <br />
<br />
They held hands as they walked for a little while longer before turning back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to drive us home?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! I get to drive a car!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s how my little Sammy must be feeling right now. Hopefully, he&#39;s adjusting to his new body.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s probably having the time of his life! I know I sure am!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They told me Sammy is an extrovert and that your brother is very introverted.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad started up the car and began to maneuver it. He was doing it all by himself! <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, David never really appreciated his body if you ask me. Now that I think about it, he seemed kind of lazy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he can put all his efforts into relearning his education. That part doesn&#39;t transfer. He&#39;s going to be an introvert in Sammy&#39;s body and Sammy is going to be extroverted as an older teen.&quot; Alan talked as the new Scott drove effortlessly, the wind coming in a bit to whip at his perfectly manicured hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;m an extrovert, too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, according to the scientists, they wanted you as a candidate because you showed early signs of a dominant personality.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really. That&#39;s good to know. I always thought about being in charge but I was so little. I was obsessed with being the big brother in the house, as far fetched as it was at the time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Back at home, Sammy was having fun playing in the house with his new toy remote control cars. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Alan! Hi, Scott!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, son. Call me DAD, okay?&quot; Alan firmly held his new son&#39;s shoulders and gave them a light squeeze. &quot;Now, I&#39;m going to spend a bit more quality time with your uncle here, but I&#39;m going to give you plenty of attention later, I promise.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...Dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
In the &quot;man cave&quot; where Alan liked to spend his private time, there was a pool table, darts, lots of cool road signs, deer heads and other masculine decorations on the wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;No kids allowed in here normally. I don&#39;t know what to make of your brother yet, but I&#39;m hoping he turns out to be a good little boy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think he will be. I think maybe he was always a bit immature and the fact that I&#39;m so much bigger and older than him now just feels...right somehow.&quot; The new Scott gave a little gasp of surprise as he saw Alan put a cigarette in his mouth, which he lit. &quot;Daddy says smoking is bad for you,&quot; he mumbled. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a man now. And FYI, you&#39;re a smoker, too. I wanted to tell you that yesterday but I forgot. You might be feeling queasy or experiencing some muscle spasms. You haven&#39;t had a cigarette for a few days now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad looked at the cigarette Alan had proffered and took it gently into his fingers. A sign of complete adulthood, he thought. The ultimate sign that he was an independent man. He fidgeted nervously as Alan gave him a light and then...before he knew it they were smoking together like pros. He enjoyed it more than he could say, the waves of relief that came over his body. He couldn&#39;t believe it! He was actually smoking a cigarette! Wait til David heard about this, he was going to be so jealous! <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nothing compared to a good cigar,&quot; Alan assured him. When we hang out with all the guys from work, we go to cigar bars. It&#39;s a good way to relieve stress and it&#39;s a good place to make professional connections, a good place to bring clients. Smoking is...it&#39;s something men can do together without judgment.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A bonding thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad blew smoke and held his cigarette with his fingers plied open like Alan. He felt like such a mature grown man. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to start working at a real job!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the attitude I want to hear. You&#39;re going to be a great replacement for my brother. My new and improved brother. To you, Scott!&quot; Alan handed Brad his first beer, a German lager. &quot;We&#39;ll start you off with regular beer and work our way up from there, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;COOOOL!&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad was smelling of cigarette smoke and had beer breath on him when he approached the new Sammy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I love bein&#39; a grown man. I just want you to know, we&#39;re all gonna take real good care of you, buddy.&quot; He got down on his knees and grabbed his nephew into a bear hug and before too long they were laughing and wrestling on the floor. &quot;See, Sammy? Isn&#39;t this fun?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You smell like beer!&quot; Brad grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just had a few beers with Alan.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could have a beer with you guys,&quot; David whined. He sounded so petulant as Sammy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re too young now. So ha ha, you can&#39;t do adult stuff and I can!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well I&#39;m really adorable now. So there.&quot;  Sammy skipped off to run throughout the large mansion. He had so much boundless energy now! <br />
<br />
The experiment was continuing to shock them both, in the best possible ways.</p>
