<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh decided that he needed to process what had just happened before he accepted any further tasks. He put his phone on the passenger seat, and started to drive home.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, he wasn&#39;t paying attention when TaskRaccoon popped up with a reminder: &quot;Click &#39;Return&#39; to revert to your original identity. You have 1 hour from completion of the task to do so, otherwise your new identity will be created and your old identity erased.&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached the same lights he stopped at on the way to the task, and thought back on what had happened. He realised that the changes were already happening last time he was here - how had he not noticed his hands? His extra height and leg length? It was as though something was keeping him from noticing.<br />
<br />
And yet, his failure to notice the big flashing reminder on his phone was entirely his own fault. Had he looked at the information about the job he had just done, he would have immediately seen the &quot;Return&quot; button. Had he tried to turn off his phone, it would have made a noise to warn him. Any number of sensible things would have led him to discover the &quot;Return&quot; button or the reminder. And yet, here he was, driving home, distracted and ignorant of his phone&#39;s warnings.<br />
<br />
In his distraction, he began driving on autopilot. He knew his way home like the back of his hand, and thus was headed there by the easiest path, while he kept thinking about what had happened. Of course, the back of his hand had changed recently, and so too had his sense of the way home. When he realised he had taken a wrong turn a while back, he had to stop by the side of the road to figure out the way home - thankfully, the older SatNav was still able to guide him successfully.<br />
<br />
He arrived home, the door unlocked just as he had accidentally left it that morning. And so, he walked in, and paused as he saw himself in the nearby mirror. He looked himself over more carefully.<br />
<br />
He was definitely taller. A lot taller. He had to be at least 30 cm taller than he had been that morning. But that wasn&#39;t the most distracting change, of course. He was very clearly latino. His skin was substantially darker than his usual pale near-whiteness, his light brown hair now nearly black and much longer than his previous crew cut. And his face... his attractive, masculine, yet youthful and playful face. He instinctively smiled, and was shocked by how attractive he was.<br />
<br />
His body had changed a lot, too. He was bigger everywhere - arms, shoulders, chest, legs... he reached toward the bulge in his swimming shorts... yep, everywhere. He lifted his now-tank-top, and admired his defined six-pack abs. He imagined all of the women that would swoon over his good looks and his body, and he started to get hard.<br />
<br />
Taking off his shorts (he wasn&#39;t wearing underwear!) and his tank top, he admired his cock as it grew harder, stretching out, 20 cm... no, 25 cm long! He glanced at one of the pictures on the wall nearby, and saw his old face and body... then he looked back at the mirror, and said &quot;I could be a porn star!&quot; - or rather, he intended to say that. What he actually said was &quot;¡Podría ser una estrella porno!&quot; - it took him a moment to realise that he wasn&#39;t speaking English, and just a moment longer to realise it was Spanish... a fact that he somehow innately knew, just as he innately knew how to speak it.<br />
<br />
He heard an engine and looked to see his parents arriving home. It was at that moment that his phone suddenly beeped loudly, then said &quot;Identity Updated&quot;. If Josh had looked at the pictures nearby, he&#39;d realise that he was no longer in any of them. But without thinking, he just assumed his parents would recognise him. He quickly put his clothes back on, and sat down to wait for them to come in.<br />
<br />
When his parents came in, they were clearly in shock. He realised they might not recognise him, and so he said &quot;Hola mamá, hola papá. ¡Soy yo, Josh!&quot;<br />
<br />
His mother immediately screamed, and his dad ran for their bedroom. His mother fumbled for her mobile phone, and said &quot;Who are you, and why have you broken into our house?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh&#39;s eyes went wide as he realised that they didn&#39;t know who he was. He freaked out, and then paused and made sure he spoke in English... albeit with a strong latino accent. &quot;It&#39;s me, your Son, Josh. I know I look different, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
His mother cut in - &quot;What are you talking about? Our son Josh died at birth! Get out, you monster! Hello, Triple Zero? A strange man has broken into our house and is tormenting us!&quot; She started giving the emergency people the address.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Josh&#39;s father came barrelling out of the bedroom, wielding a cricket bat. &quot;Get out of here, or I&#39;ll bloody you up like you deserve!&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh got up and dashed out of the house in confusion. He could hear sirens, and he immediately jumped back into the pickup truck and drove off. Once he was around the corner, he parked the car and took stock of the situation. He grabbed his wallet and checked the driver&#39;s license. &quot;José Contreras&quot;, it said, and it clearly had a picture of him as he was now - hunky latino man. His birthday, he was almost surprised to see, was the same, but everything else had changed. Then he looked at the address - it was not far from where he was when he had thought he took a wrong turn. Apparently, he really was &quot;on the way home&quot;.<br />
<br />
Josh looked at his phone, and discovered the warnings - he tried to find the &quot;Return&quot; button, only to discover the message stating that his identity had been updated. He had to decide what to do - did he accept his new life? Keep using TaskRaccoon - surely that was how he&#39;d changed? Try to contact someone to get his old life and body back? Or try to convince his parents about his real identity while still keeping this hunky body?</p>
