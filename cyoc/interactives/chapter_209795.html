<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John awoke early again at 6:30am. Classes start at 9:00am. John had a rock hard erection again, however, after sleeping on it, John knew what he had to do. He had to give into he knew sexual urges. Who cares if they are gay now. John knew he had plenty of time before Nate would wake up and wasted no time. John went straight to Nates room and approached his bed carefully. John pulled down the covers and Nate&#39;s boxers revealing his 5&quot; flaccid dick. <br />
<br />
John licked his lips and put the full thing in his mouth including his balls. John licked and sucked like he has been doing it his whole life. Within seconds Nate&#39;s dick was fully erect and John could feel the head throbbing in the back of his throat. John continued to suck, somehow fitting the 10&quot; cock and both balls while still bobbing his head up and down. John had no idea how this was ever possible but he would not question it, this felt so good. And out of relief, his own erection was finally approaching a climax after seemingly being erect all yesterday. As John was rolling his eyes in the pleasure he was feeling, he felt Nate&#39;s balls in his mouth begin to engorge and his dick twitch. Without further warning Nate released his load in John&#39;s mouth. This time though, John came almost as soon as he tasted Nate&#39;s cum. And every time Nate released a burst, John would cum as soon as he swallowed the new load, completely soiling his own underwear and shorts in the process.<br />
<br />
Eventually Nate&#39;s dick would fully soften and John would swallow down the last drop, only to cum himself, with one final burst. John had a smile on his face realizing what he had to do to continue feeling this good. John stood up, being careful not to let his own cum leak on Nate&#39;s floor and made his way to the shower. John again had to through out this underwear and shorts. As John got out of the shower he took notice of himself in the mirror. He really does look fantastic clean shaven. Also he noticed the towel rack behind him, normally his head would hide the top of the shower rack in the mirror, however, he was definitely shorter than the towel rack now. Also his waste seemed a little thinner and his hips might be wider? And his dick might have been smaller. <br />
<br />
John searched the apartment to find a tape measure and found one. He marked his height on the wall like his mom did when he was growing up and took the measurement. His height was 5&#39;6&quot; now, he definitely shrunk, his driver&#39;s license says 6&#39;1&quot;. John then measured his penis, it was 4&quot; flaccid, he thinks its smaller but he is not sure, he has never measured before. &quot;I&#39;ll have to keep track of that, maybe my driver&#39;s license was wrong for some reason. If I am definitely shrinking I&#39;ll have to call my doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The rest of the week turned into the same routine. Every morning John had his alarm go off at 6:00am so he could give Nate a blow job first thing in the morning then continue his morning routine. John started bringing in tissues and paper towels to keep himself from making a mess of his underwear. However this didn&#39;t work every time, some times he caught all his cum in the paper towels, other time he came so much or unexpectedly that they were useless. John&#39;s school work and art career took off too, every day he started off by giving Nate a blow job he would have plenty of energy and focus the rest of the day. Nate as well seemed to be doing great, he never knew what John was doing, he wasn&#39;t getting sexually frustrated from his &quot;no-fap&quot; quest, and he was in a great mood all of the time.<br />
<br />
On Friday, after finishing giving Nate a blow job and soiling yet another pair of underwear and shorts, John remembered he was measuring himself. After getting out of the shower he looked in the mirror and down at his dick. &quot;I definitely got smaller&quot; John thought, but more of in happy acceptance. He measured himself at 5&#39;2&quot; and his dick had shrunk to 2&quot; flaccid, 4&quot; erect and his balls were surprisingly small for how big his loads are. John also noticed in the mirror, he had not shaved since Sunday and didn&#39;t have any hair growth on his face or anywhere on his body. John had a much more feminine figure now too. His waste had thinned, his hip are a bit wide and his shoulders had become less broad. John thought he looked pretty cute now and he liked it. Most of John&#39;s clothes are way too big for him now as well. There is now way Nate hasn&#39;t noticed these changes or at least he hasn&#39;t said anything to John.<br />
<br />
John left the bathroom and headed to his bedroom. John threw out yet another pair of underwear and shorts and went to his dresser to grab new ones. However, he opened it up and saw that was his last pair of underwear and shorts. &quot;Well shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
John had an idea and luckily Nate had already left for classes this mourning. John went to Nate&#39;s dresser and opened it up, planning on borrowing a pair of Nate&#39;s until he could buy some more. But when John opened Nate&#39;s dresser drawer he noticed something on the left side of the drawer. There were pink and purple striped women&#39;s panties. Those were Nate&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s, she must never had taken them when they broke up. John reached for them and held them up, they were so cute. Without any further hesitation John pulled them on. They fit perfectly! Even his small budge at the front was small enough that the underwear was not uncomfortable. It seemed to be the exact waste bands size that he now has which gave John another idea. There were some other clothes in Nate&#39;s drawers that belonged to his ex as well, so John grabbed some of them. He grabbed a thong, yoga pants, a crop top, skinny jeans, booty shorts, a one-piece swimsuit and bikini, and an few extra pairs of panties.</p>
