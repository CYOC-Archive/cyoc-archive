<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johannes strode across his room, and opened his closet door to get his <br />
jeans and leather jacket just as Jeff's Chronivac chimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
His clothing was gone. In its place now hung various leather and steel <br />
harnesses, and other bondage gear. Johannes clenched his fists and <br />
slammed the closet door. He took a step backward into the wall as he <br />
stared at his transformed room.  It was now all painted with glossly <br />
white latex paint including the floors.  His carpet, furniture, <br />
posters and -everything was gone.  It had all been replaced.<br />
<br />
A leather sling hung from a hook mounted in the ceiling. The window <br />
was gone and replaced by a door to the outside. In place of his bed, <br />
Johannes now had a straw filled stall.  There was a drain in the <br />
middle of the floor and a hose/shower area now stood where his desk <br />
had been.  The walls were lined with various restraints, whips and <br />
other tools of punishment.  Johannes swallowed hard. His back had been <br />
to the room for only a few seconds it was impossible.  Then he started <br />
reading the new posters on the walls.  <br />
<br />
&quot;OBEY YOUR MASTER!&quot; read one with a picture of Jeff.<br />
<br />
The others were similar. Johannes growled. He slammed his fist into <br />
his palm.  He didn't know how Jeff had done it, but he knew he had. <br />
Johannes threw open his door and balked.  It wasn't the hallway. His <br />
room was now in the basement.  There were the basement stairs, but <br />
Johannes suddenly knew that he wasn't permitted to use those stairs. <br />
He looked around and saw the rope hanging through the hole in the <br />
ceiling.  He immediately began climbing.  He climbed 12 feet to the <br />
ground floor, but he didn't get off here where the hole opened in a <br />
closet.  He continued climbing and got off.  He was upstairs in a <br />
closet. He caught his breath after his workout, then he opened the <br />
door.  The hallway was different.  He was in the suite of two rooms, a <br />
common area and bathroom that he had shared with his stepbrother, but <br />
it was clearly all Jeff's space now.  The Foosball table was gone.  In <br />
its place was a game table with a chess board on it. There was a <br />
history text book lying open on the table.  The chapter heading caught <br />
Johannes' eye.  He reached down and grabbed the book and started <br />
reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Modern Slavery In The USA,&quot; read the chapter heading.  Beneath it was <br />
a photo of a presidential inaugural parade, but instead of a car, it <br />
was a carriage being drawn by a dozen naked white and Asian slaves. <br />
The caption read, &quot;President Truman's Inauguration after his re-<br />
election.  Symbolizing the superiority of the allies over the Axis, <br />
prisoners of war pull the president's carriage.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Johannes read, he learned how during the Depression slavery was <br />
reintroduced to the United States as a way of dealing with rampant <br />
unemployment.  Primarily prisoners were enslaved and it represented <br />
less than 2 percent of the economy.  During the war, using German, <br />
Italian and Japanese POW's as slaves became widespread.  After the <br />
war, thousands of foreign slaves were imported as war reparations. By <br />
the 60's the growth spurt that had been fueled by foreign war slaves <br />
was petering out, and there was a baby boom to deal with.  Enslavement <br />
laws were broadened to deal with the growing unemployment and surplus <br />
population. <br />
<br />
Johannes couldn't believe what he was reading. His eyes were <br />
transfixed to the page.  He knew this was bogus, but he also knew it <br />
was all true. He didn't hear Jeff's door open or see his stepbrother <br />
and master staring at him.<br />
<br />
Jeff grinned.  It had worked.  He cleared his throat and barked out, <br />
&quot;Yo-yo, get your butt over here, and kiss your master's crotch like <br />
you really mean it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-?&quot; roared Johannes, but to his horror.  He found his body moving <br />
as it was ordered.  He rushed over to Jeff and dropped to his knees. <br />
He tried to pull his head away.  He said, &quot;No-oomph.&quot; His no cut short <br />
by his lips French kissing Jeff's crotch. Tears welled up in his eyes <br />
as he looked up at Jeff, &quot;Why?&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that? Or why are you my slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not your slave,&quot; Johannes said. He instantly knew that he was <br />
dead wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are, and there's nothing you can do about it, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-boy?&quot; growled Johannes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, boy.  You ever hear of a Chronivac, Yo-yo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's Johannes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it's Yo-yo.  Now tell me your name, Yo-yo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Yo-er, uh, my name is Yo-yo!&quot; sobbed Johannes as he knelt <br />
at Jeff's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now about the Chronivac?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's just an urban legend - isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you are forbidden to tell anyone ever what I'm going to tell you <br />
now, Yoyo.  The Chronivac is real.  I just used it on you.  I changed <br />
reality to make you my slave. When mother married my dad, your dad had <br />
already been enslaved, so you were enslaved too.  They shipped you out <br />
to Oldham Farms to be trained as a ponyslave.  You were brought back <br />
to serve me on my 15th birthday when I got my slavedriver's permit. <br />
You're my personal and ponyslave. To Johannes horror, he remembered <br />
everything that Jeff described, but he also remembered that his real <br />
father had declared bankruptcy, and his mother had remarried.  He had <br />
been the star football player in high school, and he was a leader at <br />
his college campus, and all of that was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only you and I remember what was, Yoyo. And you cannot tell anyone <br />
what I did, and you cannot touch the Chronivac to try to change <br />
anything,&quot; Jeff explained, &quot;While you have your old memories, you must <br />
obey my commands and any other free person's command. Now I'm going to  <br />
go to town, so I need you to slide down the rope and go put on your <br />
black riding harness, and then go harness yourself to my carriage.  <br />
I'll be down in a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master,&quot; Johannes heard himself say as he stood up, and bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and take off those clothes,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;Slaves are normally <br />
naked, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master,&quot; Johannes said sullenly as he slid off Jeff's boxer <br />
briefs.  He was startled to see that he no longer had tan lines, and <br />
that his cock had been pierced.  <br />
<br />
Naked with his head hanging, Johannes returned to the closet, and <br />
started to slide down the rope.  Jeff grinned as he heard Yoyo yelp in <br />
pain - &quot;Rope burn!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff went back to his room to make some improvements to his own body, <br />
and tweak Yoyo's a bit before he went into see how the town had been <br />
reshaped in his new reality.<br />
<br />
Yoyo adjusted his harness and exited via the outside door.  It led up <br />
concrete steps to the garage which no longer housed automobiles.  <br />
Jeff's carriage was red and black fiberglass, and Yoyo efficiently <br />
harnessed himself to the carriage thanks to his new memories of being <br />
a slave.  It was a bit disconcerting, Johannes had been angry most of <br />
the time, and he was confused by the fact that Yoyo was content and <br />
happy to be a slave.  Maybe Jeff had done him a favor?  he wondered as <br />
he pulled the carriage out of the garage and around to the front of <br />
the house. <br />
<br />
Only after a few minutes of standing there naked did it suddenly hit <br />
Johannes that he was standing naked out on the street harnessed to a <br />
buggy.  He heard heavy breathing, running feet and the creak of <br />
wheels.  A milk wagon came up the street drawn by a dozen strapping <br />
naked men.  Johannes stared as he recognized Coach Griggs as the lead <br />
pony.  He didn't know the other slaves, but he knew better than to <br />
speak.  Coach Griggs showed no recognition as he ran passed.<br />
<br />
That's right only Johannes and Jeff have memories of what used to and <br />
was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The door opened, but Johannes couldn't see because of the blinders.  <br />
He knew better than to turn his head.<br />
<br />
A hand slapped his right  butt cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good, Yoyo!&quot; Jeff said as he climbed into the carriage.<br />
<br />
A whip cracked neck to Yoyo's ear. Jeff said, &quot;Gidyap!&quot;<br />
<br />
Johannes started to run.  The reins steered him to move away from the <br />
curb as he pulled the carriage.  Johannes was surprised at how easily <br />
the carriage moved.  It seemed lighter then before even with Jeff in <br />
it.  Then Johannes noted how tight the harness now felt against his <br />
skin.  Jeff must have used the Chronivac to make him buffer.  He was <br />
stronger, and he realized maybe an inch or two taller as he pulled the <br />
carriage.  Once they left their street, Jeff and Johannes started <br />
noticing a lot more traffic.  There were litter bearers, slave drawn <br />
buggies like Jeff's, teams of slaves drawing carts, wagons and large <br />
carriages.  It was amazing.  <br />
<br />
Jeff's jaw dropped as he recognized one of a pair of slaves drawing a <br />
white carriage toward him.  The one he recognized was Pete &quot;Butch&quot; <br />
Parker, a jock and bully, and his best friend's brother.  Jeff thought <br />
it couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. Only as the carriage drew <br />
closer did he recognize the other shaved slave.  It was Butch's <br />
brother. It was Jeff's best friend Steve Parker.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you gawking at, Jeffrey?&quot; asked the driver of the other <br />
buggy, as she reined her slaves to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, they look so much alike,&quot; he blurted out. He pulled his <br />
reins too, stopping Yoyo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they are a nice matched pair, but they are brothers after all,&quot; <br />
said Megan Parker. <br />
<br />
&quot;But they're your brothers?&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
Megan rolled her eyes, &quot;Isn't that slave your brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stepbrother,&quot; Jeff answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; answered Megan knowingly, &quot;You thought these were my brothers? <br />
Who told you that?  They're stepbrothers. You know most children are <br />
enslaved when their parents divorce. My stepbrothers were enslaved <br />
when my father divorced their mother before he married my mother and I <br />
was born.  They do look a lot like dad, but he said it was better for <br />
them to be enslaved and sold than to have a mixed family, and his <br />
bitch of an ex-wife wanted the money anyway.  I was lucky that the man <br />
who bought them kept them as a pair, and I was able to buy them at his <br />
Estate Sale.  Father wasn't exactly pleased though,&quot; she added in a <br />
confused sad voice.</p>
