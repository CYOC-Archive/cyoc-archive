<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly there was a screaming crowd, and James and Lily found themselves amidst a bright stage with various camera flashes. Both shivered, realizing that both of them were dressed only in glittery posers. Losing focus, James had dropped the controller on the floor, still in a daze from the transportation conducted.<br />
<br />
“What on earth…?” Lily murmured, who had futilely attempted to shield her slightly sagging teats. <br />
<br />
James had found himself too stunned to speak, he was a rather average man, with decent musculature, but nothing to write home about. His cheeks had tinged red at the thought of his wife and him on stage, their bodies being compared to veritable behemoths next to him.<br />
<br />
“James,” Lily groaned, just as an announcer blared his voice over the microphone.<br />
<br />
<b>“Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to the Arnold’s 2022 Mister Olympia Competition! We hope you’re ready to see these competitors strut their stuff and show just how much training they’ve done!”</b><br />
<br />
Cheers erupted from the audience, drowning out Lily’s calls as James found his embarrassment shift to excitement as the announcer began listing out names. He was one of the big boys now, even if his physique wasn’t the best, he could still do som-<br />
<br />
James paused. What <I>exactly</I> were he and Lily doing here?<br />
<br />
<b>“And we’d like to welcome our two people’s choice athletes, Mr. James AND Mr. Liam, both 5th consecutive winners weighing in over 270 pounds!”</b><br />
<br />
James nearly chuckled, hearing those funny words while he absentmindedly flexed his biceps. His body shivered, the remote’s effects coming in to full swing as Lily’s body followed suit.<br />
<br />
“James,” Lily once again spoke up, voice once soft and meek now broadcasting with power.<br />
<br />
“THIS is what true dedication looks like!” The woman roared, striking a side chest pose.<br />
<br />
James looked over, expecting to see a shrimp of a competitor, but watched as the woman’s body fat was melting. Saggy flesh had dissipated leaving her lean and lithe, only for musculature to begin forming around the blank canvas.<br />
<br />
Anatomical names of the muscles popped into James’ head as they appeared on Lily’s body, comically surging outwards as her right side expanded, followed by wing like lats and rounding deltoids. <br />
<br />
Lialy couldn’t help but grunt, arms filling out from small lumps to softball sized biceps to respectable melons that were bulging in their double bicep pose. James attempted to follow, unaware that his own body was beginning to refine itself. Soft dainty hands had become rough, nail-polish disappearing into the aether as thickened callouses found their way onto masculine palms. Lialy growled, the smoothness of her throat was discarded in favor for a bulge that had blossomed wonderfully. She sneered as the camera flashes remained on her, with each flash, her body continued to grow.<br />
<br />
James, not to be forgotten, had flashed a pearly white smile, his own wrinkles had withered away, hair finding their way back onto his scalp. Muscles that were once in his prime found their way onto his frame, his body absorbing the testosterone like a fish in water. James cooly turned around, not realizing he was dangerously close to the remote as he stomped the ground and flexed his biceps. His once flat ass had, in the span of a camera flash, inflating nearly comically. The glutes living up to the name of “Gluteus Maximus” as they bulged into view. He could starkly recall Lialy barking at him to squat “Ass to the grass” and scowled. <br />
<br />
He wouldn’t be second runner up again, he loved his spouse, but he had hated how bossy she was. But this was <I>his</I> thing, <I>his</I> event. Who was he to let his partner show him up? After all, they couldn’t even decide on a tv channel!<br />
<br />
James hoisted his leg up just as his thighs wobbled, mass piling into them. Why did that word seem so familiar? TV…<br />
<br />
He grabbed his glittery blue poser and looked down, just as his calves built into his frame, rounding and begging to be flexed. Did he always look like this?<br />
<br />
<b>“Gentleman, you have 30 seconds left for the free pose!”</b><br />
<br />
With the crowd eagerly watching, James had abandoned what didn’t matter in favor for what did, the trophy. His forehead was becoming slick, not with sweat, but with a glisten akin to a bronzer as the rest of his body fat had become in the single digits. James could feel his face pop into place as a lantern like jaw replaced his previous underbite and did a side chest pose.<br />
<br />
Ragged, older skin was sloughed off by the power of the remote, Lialy’s face had went backwards in time as they were rejuvenated, losing the dark circles in her eyes as she puffed her saggy chest for a lat spread. As if realizing it was their time to shine, her receding breasts had quickly dissipated, just as the body fat had went instead to her rear end. The derriere perked up immediately, threatening to consume the pink posers. She bounced them for her own enjoyment as her pecs grew massively, lurching outwards like a pair of firm pillows.<br />
<br />
“FUCK YEAH.” They yelled, as soothing heat had entered their core. Liamly’s abs had come into full view, the camera flashes had only helped to bring their definition out more until their core was thick.<br />
<br />
Liamly frowned and sucked in her gut, before flexing it, folding her massive hands behind her head just as the abdominals became cobblestone, decorating her tapering waistline. Serratus muscles were chiseled into her figure as James quickly found his crouched single bicep flex reaching an admirable peak.<br />
<br />
Liamly groaned, trying to maintain a smile as their jaw crunched and followed James’ example of a handsome lantern shape. Their once long red hair had receded into their scalp,  the messy hairstyle had turned into a simple fade undercut as James’ hair combed over and gained volume. Liamly’s clit had become engorged, the fleshy wet entrance reforming into a long, snaking tool that had expanded his posers tantalizingly, as stubble carefully came into view. Liam’s counterpart, James, smirked viciously as his cock had also stretched the fabric of the posers, but found himself once again growling in contempt as Liam’s body had grown higher in height.<br />
&#8232;Suddenly it wasn’t on equal footing that they were on, as Liam’s once delicate feet lost their femininity and instead grew far more rugged and thickened. <br />
<br />
What remained of their conversation on the TV had evaporated in James’ mind as he found memories of the other competitors in his mind. There were Kyle Stone, Hugh Hoffman, Emmet Jackson, among others with himself and Liam as the competitor couple going against each other, all respectable bodybuilders. <br />
<br />
James relished the camera’s on him, he found, just like Liam. Another couple flashes. A woman screamed in ecstasy. The men had been lapping it up, unaware that their bodies continued to burgeon into waddling territory, James’ feeling of bulk had become more natural, more normal as he recalled needing help to take off his tank tops or need to walk into a room sideways. It was his pride and joy as a bodybuilder to be this strong, to be this bulky. To be every bit the man these tiny whelps wished they were.<br />
<br />
Mentally, the image of a scale going from his original 150 pounds to a godly 270 made James adjust his posers.<br />
<br />
<b>“Thank you gentlemen for your work on the free poses! Is there anything you’d like for the judges and the crowd to see before we take a minute to do the mandatory poses?” The announcer beckoned.</b><br />
<br />
The line of masculine bodybuilders, muscle bound and dressed in skimpy posers beamed with pride. They were the epitome of all things that embodied the male form.<br />
<br />
Liam looked over to James, and James smirked to him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Hugh,” James yelled out.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, man?” A deep voice responded.<br />
<br />
“Check out these fucking peaks, bro, I’m going for gold this year!” James bellowed, brutishly slamming his feet onto the ground yet again and lowering himself into a most muscular pose. <br />
<br />
Liam followed along by copying James’ pose, and both turned to each other and gave a mighty growl. The cameras and the crowd ate it up, the competitors attempting to save face as they operated their favorite final pose… But none could admit just how much it had turned each of them on.<br />
<br />
<b>“Thank you gentlemen! We’ll take a short break, but when we return, the individual posing will commence!”</b><br />
<br />
James smirked, the off feeling he had tapered off, and he found himself fist pumping Liam as he watched the other competitors begin leaving single file. Liam walked ahead of him, giving James a lingering view of what was in store for him later. With a single step, however, James heard a cryptic “Chk” sound, and an odd sensation…</p>
