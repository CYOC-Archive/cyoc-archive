<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>“Well Spike my bearish man, we are tired from having that great food and we need a place to stay for the night. Do you have one for us?”</br>
<br>Spike smiles at the two and winks. “Yeah, I am sure I can find you two a room. The guys and I live right above the restaurant. We don‘t really have staff to have a hotel set up for people to stay in. Heck, we don‘t get that many visitors out this way anyway. The exception of course with Rich here. You guys can have my room, so when you head to the back of the restaurant to head upstairs, just tell one of the guys back there that I am letting you have my room for the night.</br>
<br>David nodded his head, thanking Spike for his hospitality and walked toward the back of the restaurant. Rich on the other hand, wasn‘t exactly sure of what he should do. He knew David was gay and he didn‘t want to even come close to having a sexual encounter in the room. In Rich’s mind, being gay was wrong and gross, but he also knew that if he didn‘t go upstairs with David and left, David would find Rich and possibly do something terrible to him. Rich knew that he had to go with David, but he really wasn‘t happy about it.</br>
<br>As David reaches the back area, he looked around and saw Rich standing a few feet away from him and the other guys.</br>
<br>“Hey Rich… what is the deal? I thought you were curious about what gay life was like…?”</br>
<br>“Well… yeah I am, but I don‘t know what I want really…”</br>
<br>“Ok, I‘ll tell you what. We will go upstairs, you can sleep on the bed and I will sleep on the floor. If you want, we can talk and you can ask whatever you want. We will take it at your pace. How does that sound bud?”</br>
<br>“I guess that sounds ok.”</br>
<br>“Very good and I am glad to hear it!”</br>
<br>David smiles at Rich, trying to set him at ease, but it seemed like it only gave Rich a reason for more tension. Knowing that there really wasn‘t anything David could do, he motioned to Brad to come over.</br>
<br>“Yeah, what‘s up David?”</br>
<br>“We need a room for the night because Rich is too tired, from his day and eating, to drive us back to the city. Your buddy over there, Spike, said that we could have his room for the night and that none of you would mind having him in your room.”</br>
<br>“Oh, he did, did he?”</br>
<br> Brad looks over to Spike who was just nodding his head and  looked back toward David. Brad‘s cold and masculine yet expressionless face, quickly changed and warmed up as soon as he smiled.</br>
<br>“Yea… sure I think I can help you two out with that. Since you probably don‘t know which room is Spike‘s; head up the stairs and when you reach the top, turn right and then look for the door with a picture of a hairy and beefy fireman. That is his room and I know he wont mind you using whatever is in his room. Spike‘s motto is whatever is his is yours.”</br>
<br>“Thanks a lot Brad… I am sure all we will be doing is sleeping when we get up there.”</br>
<br>Brad winked at David and smiled as he moved out of their way so they could go upstairs and do whatever. As David and Rich reached the top of the stairs, David looked to his right and immediately saw the poster picture Brad had mentioned. David‘s cock began to stir in his pants, looking at the muscles the guy had on him, the furry and trimmed chest and the mega cock standing straight out for someone to enjoy. Rich followed closely behind, oddly knowing that he could trust David, but not the others. Rich was beginning to have paranoid thoughts about the other bearish men taking him to a secret place and ravaging him against his will. As David went to open the door to Spike‘s room, Rich stood there beside him and before David opened the door, he closed it, showing the poster to Rich.</br>
<br>“Hey Rich, what do you think about this guy here? Do you think he is hot or do you just see him as another guy?”</br>
<br>“I… I think he is hot… damn hot… and his cock, oh my god I can‘t believe I want to lock my lips around that meaty member!”</br>
<br>“Heh, that is exactly how I feel! Well at least we know where your mind is now. You may end up like us after all, but we will take it one step at a time.”</br>
<br>David reopened the door and the two walked right in. What was inside was far more impressive than the man on the door. The walls were covered in posters of hairy, beefy, naked, big cocked men. Some of the posters were split images, the left half being a human male and on the right was the same person, but he was transformed into an anthro bearman. There were even pictures of Spike, Brad, Terry and who they assumed was the cook. The four were extremely hot, both in their human and bearish forms. David looked towards Rich, who was staring at all of the pictures on the wall, almost drooling, seemingly sexually hungry. As soon as he realized what he was doing, Rich stopped and composed himself. David just chuckled as he walked over to the bed. Spike‘s bed was very big, bigger than a full size queen and which David assumed was for play in the male‘s larger bearish forms. Curious to know what else was in the room, David went snooping, which he knew Spike wouldn‘t mind. When David opened the closet, a huge smile came across his face, seeing all of the various sized dildos. Knowing that it would be fun to play with them, David grabbed the thickest one, and brought it over to Rich who was now sitting on the bed. David sat down next to him, dildo in hand and Rich stared at it. Rich tried to look away, knowing it was wrong for him to want it, but he couldn‘t and he did want it.</br>
<br>“You like that don’t you Rich?”</br>
<br>“Y… yes… I do!</br>
<br>“How do you feel about all these naked, bear men around you?”</br>
<br>“Honestly, I have been trying to fight it, but as you can tell from the bulge in my pants, I haven‘t been very successful.” A sly grin came over his face.</br>
<br>“Well, there are a couple options we have right now. We can either go to sleep, or we can stay awake a bit longer and chat.”</br>
<br>“I say we stay up and chat for a while.”</br>
<br>“Good, so what do you think about the dildo I have in my hands?”</br>
<br>“I can‘t believe I am going to say this… but it looks tasty. I‘d love to see if I could get something like that in my mouth or ass!”</br>
<br>David‘s eyes went wide, not expecting to hear that.</br>
<br>“You do huh? Well my cock is as big as that dildo, I think it‘s even slightly bigger. Would you like to see it?”</br>
<br>Rich hesitated, not really knowing why he was saying the things that were coming out of his mouth.</br>
<br>“Yeah, let me see that big piece of meat!”</br>
<br>Knowing it was the kiss that changed him from being a fag hater to a hungry cocksucker, David smiled while standing up, placing the dildo on the bed and unbuttoning his pants. David was still wearing a pair of plaid boxers he grabbed before him and his father left for the park. David gestured for Rich to go ahead and grab his cock through the front hole in his boxers. Rich of course hesitated, but reached in slowly and felt David‘s exceptionally fat and soft cock. David‘s eyes rolled in the back of his head in pleasure from having Rich do that. Rich began to stroke it slowly, making it come to life and ooze copious amounts of precum, coating Rich‘s entire hand. As David grew and grew, poking out of the hole where Rich could see what he was holding on to Rich‘s hand slipped off David‘s large and engorged cock. David smiled at Rich, nodding with his head to go ahead for Rich to have a taste of the goo, since Rich was looking at it with curiosity.</br>
<br>Rich shook off the feeling he was having, not wanting to give into the gay feelings he was having. Rich wiped his hand on the bed sheets, then proceeded to take of his shirt, feeling a bit hotter now than he had before all of this began. David looked at Rich‘s chest, it was nothing too impressive. He had an athletic build, smooth with a light tan, taught nipples with a slight trail below his navel. Something internally compelled him to grab David‘s cock again. Using his right hand, he cupped the slippery cock and stroked slowly. David moaned, feeling an exceptional amount of pleasure surge through his body. Rich‘s hand quickly became coated in precum once more and this time Rich took a slight lick of his finger, just to see how it tasted. To Rich‘s surprise it tasted good and sweet like honey. Rich began to crave the taste, licking another finger clean, then his entire palm, then everywhere else the sweet substance touched. Rich didn‘t even care how gross it might have seemed to him in the past, but he wanted as much as he could get. Rich knelt directly in front of David‘s massive cock, pulled his shorts down and started licking at David‘s cock-head with the tip of his tongue. Every lick elicited even more pre, gushing out in thick beads.</br>
<br>“Oh yeah Rich, that feels excellent! I knew you would like it once you got over your fears and insecurities.”</br>
<br>Rich went from licking at David‘s head, to full on sucking as much of the cock in his mouth that he could. Suddenly, Rich began getting hotter and cramps overtook his abdomen. His skin began to increase in heat and Rich ripped off all of his clothes quickly, hoping it would help, which it only did momentarily. Rich‘s muscles bulked out, his skin began to itch intolerably, his hair changed from the light brown on his head to a dark brown. As Rich scratched all over, dark brown hair sprouted all over his body, covering his muscular pecs, over his pouchy but hard stomach, all over his muscular forearms, his meaty hands and fingers, down his thighs, legs and to his feet and toes. He began to moan, not in pain but in pleasure as his cock and balls grew. He was a meager six inches and not very thick, but that quickly changed as he grew to nine inches long and as thick as a beer can. David checked Rich out, looking his body over a couple times and began to growl.</br>
<br>David began changing, shifting into his bear form and as Rich watched, he felt a certain pull deep down in the pit of his stomach. Slowly, Rich‘s fingers and hands grew thicker and meaty, getting covered in a dark brown fur, his fingernails grew black and elongated slightly, curling and sharpening. Thick pads of dark black skin formed on the palms of his hands, then the change moved up his forearms, growing thicker in musculature. Rich‘s biceps bulged out even more, growing to about 18 inches around, his neck muscles bulked up a bit more, his chest and stomach became bigger, thicker and more round. His thighs grew into tree trunks, his legs followed in size but tapered down towards his ankles and feet. Rich began to breathe quick and shallow breaths as his face pushed out into a bearish muzzle, his ears rounded out and migrated to the top of his head. Towards the end of his change, Rich whimpered as the nubby tail pushed out from the bottom of his spine. Just as suddenly as his change began, his cock began to grow twice as long and thick, now eleven inches long and as thick as two beer cans, while his balls grew from hen‘s eggs to grapefruits. Rich became super horny, stroking his huge and still human shaped cock vigorously and roared as he hit his climax, covering the room, himself and David in his thick bearman seed.</br>
<br>David hungrily lapped up as much cum as he could, all the while chuckling to himself, and paused to make a comment.</br>
<br>“Well… I guess you are not just superman anymore huh? I think your new name should be SuperBear!”</br></p>
