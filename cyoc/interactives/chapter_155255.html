<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Give me the apple loyal maid, and stand back as I help the princess. Don’t worry, I will not allow the witch to harm you”<br />
<br />
“Thank you fair prince” <br />
<br />
“As you bring me the cursed food I should probably remove my armor if I will change form…”<br />
<br />
The disguised sorceress reached the table and picked one of the apples as the knight removed the pieces of his armor quickly and with ease, remaining at the end only with a shirt and a pair of boxers.<br />
<br />
Committed to the deception, the witch covered her eyes with a hand and with a rosy blush stammered “Prince Armando, here is the last ingredient, and good luck”<br />
<br />
Armando didn’t even hesitate to bite into the juicy fruit, and in a manner of minutes only the core remained. A tense silence fell as the man waited for a change of some kind, but as the seconds passed the prince thought more and more that the magic user could have tricked the maid.<br />
<br />
He tried to state as much “Are you sure this was the right thing to do? Because nothing happe-urgh!” The man groaned as his hands moved to cover the stomach, and a thin layer of sweat appeared in his face. His shirt tented as his chest and muscles grew in size, until it was finally ripped apart by the enlarging frame. The transformation overtook the body in a fast pace, coarse hair developed to replace skin and a long tail grew from the tailbone, followed short after by a fitting mane. Armando watched with uncertainty as his hands transformed into a pair of stumps, and felt with some trepidation the feet curl up into themselves, leaving the man with a full set of newly minted hooves. Unable to balance himself on only two legs the prince fell forward to assume a more comfortable position, and the two forelegs landed with a loud clop.<br />
<br />
Next was the face, that stretched into a muzzle as his ears migrated upward and changed completely, followed shortly after by the last remnant of the man the stud was previously.<br />
<br />
In a manner of minutes where before a handsome royal was now a black stallion with a brown mane stood awkwardly, a bit dazed and confused by the new sensations.<br />
<br />
“Prince Armando, are you still, well, you?” The sorceress asked bemusedly, as this was the first trial of the potion. The stud’s ears shifted and perked up at the sound of her voice, and after he pawned the floor uncertainly the animal nodded. ‘Perfect’ Thought the witch with glee ‘The last step of the plan can begin now. I wonder if Armando detected the horse pheromones I spread earlier?’<br />
<br />
The stud was in fact looking around a bit frantically, and at last his eyes locked on the body of the mare inside the stall with a hesitant sort of longing, unable to hide his swelling erection &#39;Definitely yes to my last question, but he is still a bit reluctant, no doubt because the filly don’t have a single human reaction and behave like the animal she is in reality… It seems that pheromones alone aren’t enough to drive the transformed man into the new carnal urges, but he is clearly aroused so it’s a start… Rather good for a first try, next time I should try to tempt them with a female in season, or maybe change those foolish paladins into females themselves… So many possibilities, so little time&#39;<br />
<br />
“My prince, you must remember that her will is ensnared by the vile sorcery, and…” No more words were needed as the stallion approached  the tied mare with tentative steps, his eyes never leaving her swishing tail, and with a sense of awkwardness he got on her back, in an acceptable mounting position for a horse. After a few clumsy and missed thrusts the former prince finally found his mark, and as an unintentional whinny escaped his mouth the sorceress hid a smile, Armando starting to familiarize himself with the new body, suddenly uncaring about things like modesty and the lewd show that began before a witness.<br />
<br />
‘Maybe I overestimated him, this paladin didn’t even motioned me to leave or turn around as he claimed Star’ The disguised maid returned to her natural form with a snap of her fingers, unnoticed by the two lovers ‘He will make a fine addition to my stables, the first of a long list. And after them… there are many sons of nobles that would jump for the favor of a princess, and would frolic to my tower for a mere rumor’<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the two horses lost themselves in the moment due to their baser instincts, the mare easily welcoming the stud’s member into her depths as intended, while the former man unexpectedly followed the example of his partner and gave his all to please the filly underneath, and with a final thrust the former prince reached his climax at the same time of the mare with a grunt.<br />
<br />
“Bravo! A fantastic display!” The witch cackled as Armando dismounted the mare and looked pointedly around the lair as the made-up animal curse didn’t break as he hoped, and the stallion stiffened in fright as he saw the sorceress’s form not far from his current position “After this I’m seriously tempted to appoint you as the official helper to show our future victims the joys of being an animal, but I think I will wait a bit. So dashing prince, how was Star? I bought this lovely mare only a few weeks ago, and you could tell she was eager to meet her mate at the earliest” Throughout this explanation Armando’s eyes continued to widen more and more, until his jaw dropped open in a very human-like fashion when the witch casually told that he mounted a random mare and not the sorceress’s captive “That’s right Armando, I am sorry to inform you that the princess is not here, and you should always beware the words of unknown maids. On the other hands, or hooves now for you, you proved yourself virile enough for our resident filly and by the power conferred to me as the only person alive that knows your original form and will never return you to it I declare you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I admit, the ceremony was a bit rushed, but after the prowess you showed earlier this outcome should be most fitting, considering that you will remain a horse for the rest of your life” Denial danced into the former prince’s eyes at this declaration, even as the mare rubbed her muzzle against his in a sign of affection “See Armando, Star approves the changes. You are in the presence of a genius after all! As you should know, if you bothered to research my specialization in magic for our confrontation, transformations are fickle things and never permanent, even cursed ones. That would have been true until today though, when I finally succeeded in changing a living being, in this case a prince in search of my captive princess, into a barnyard animal with no sign of reversal. Everyone has a bit of magic within them, and this minuscule amount always reject foreign energy in the system of the host, returning the former human to his natural form in time. But you stud” The witch grabbed between her hands the stallion’s muzzle and started to pet him “I overwrote the imprint on your inner magic to that of a stallion, and it worked! Your energy settled, and will instead fight if someone tries to return you to human form! Isn’t this fantastic?”<br />
<br />
The former prince tried to back away from the mad woman, but his hooves were planted firmly on the floor as the witch gushed over her first success with a wide smile “But dear me, what a terrible host I was. Boys” A dozen stone golems entered slowly form the wooden door used by the prince, carrying an assortment of ropes and lassoes and two brand new halters for the two lovers “I wouldn’t want to keep you newlyweds from your honeymoon long, so bring our guest to his new accommodation in the stable with Star in tow, it seems to me that the poor stud has already fallen for the mare’s charm. Now leave me, I must prepare for our inevitable next guest”</p>
