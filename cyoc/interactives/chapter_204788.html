<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle nervously glanced down again at Jen&#39;s huge horse balls she was leaving dangling in the open air. Kyle suddenly realized that before any transformation changes even started his biggest crush at school had always been Jen. When Jen and her friends had pantsed him the other week he&#39;d been so angry with Jen in particular in part because he was so puppy dog in love with her up to that point. He struggled with the realization that his petty attempt at revenge might backfire spectacularly here and now with Jen wishing he&#39;d transform into the &quot;perfect partner&quot; for his crush. Kyle could only wonder in frustration as the changes started, what sort of partner would a woman that was so proud and happy with a pair of huge, dangling horse balls (which Kyle had attempted to punish her with) would find &quot;perfect&quot;?<br />
<br />
Of course Kyle didn&#39;t have to wait long as the curse usually acted pretty fast in its transformations. It was obvious from the first moments of breasts ballooning under his chest that he was outwardly becoming a very well endowed woman. Kyle managed to catch his own reflection in the mirror Jen kept inside her open locker. In that reflection it became quickly obvious how much outwardly he was turning into a twin of Jen, including the silly horse ears. Kyle knew Jen had always been a narcissist, but it still surprised him that Jen&#39;s perfect partner might include a bit of twincest. Kyle had always thought Jen was hot, so it was arousing to Kyle in its own ways.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s new horse tail lifted in arousal as he realized his pants and underwear had disappeared for a barely there skirt and no underwear. Kyle was sure that his tail lifting his skirt up with it was quite a sight for anyone standing behind him in the hallway. Kyle knew from the dripping feeling he likely had a mare cunt and asshole on full display at that moment. The thought of being that exposed sent another shiver of arousal through him and the realization of how fast his skirt was lifting at front, too. Kyle was excited to find that not only did he still have a cock, but that it had grown to a massive stallionhood.<br />
<br />
Kyle reached down to adjust his balls and first was excited that that they felt bigger than Jen&#39;s looked until he brushed a very pleasurable feeling nipple and little bit of milk dripped onto his finger. Startled by how much of stream he let out to puddle on the floor with even the barest of tugs, Kyle realized that instead of balls he had horse udders big enough to be almost cow-like.<br />
<br />
Staring Jen directly in the highs, Kyle felt the dare start to kick in as he seductively asked, &quot;Jen, uh, do you want to have sex right now?&quot; To Kyle his voice in that moment sounded less like a twin of Jen&#39;s and more like a hentai voice actress he couldn&#39;t quite name.<br />
<br />
Jen squeed with joy and did a little jump that left Kyle&#39;s eyes darting to her bouncing breasts (breasts which Kyle now had his own pretty copy of), and she said, &quot;Oh Kyle, I thought you never would ask! Look at what a pretty stallion you are now. Of course I want to have sex with you in this very public hallway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle realized every word of that was sincere, and that he&#39;d have a lot to maybe unpack with Jen later. Especially that part where he too felt incredibly aroused by how many eyes were on the two of them as Jen removed her leggings and Kyle gently maneuvered his massive cock around her huge balls.<br />
<br />
Once they were coupled below, Jen moved in to deeply kiss Kyle. It wasn&#39;t even a few minutes into the kiss that Jen made the sexiest sneeze Kyle had ever seen. Kyle felt like he should be grossed out by someone sneezing right into his mouth, but instead he was surprised at how arousing it felt. Though he was the one who had cursed Jen to ejaculate horse cum out of her mouth it would take Kyle a surprising number of minutes to realize that amazing tasting gooey &quot;saliva&quot; he was swallowing at every chance and even gently licking more of it off Jen&#39;s face and nostrils was in fact her horse cum. It would be a few days yet before Kyle would learn that the pleasure he was feeling with each swallow was the reward from his body redirecting that cum into both of his new wombs, one more human and the other more horsey. Kyle&#39;s mouth having taken on some pussy-like qualities in response to the way he&#39;d cursed Jen. (Kyle would soon after that discover how much capability that gave him for some self-love, blowing his own stallionhood. Jen had wished for him to have nearly as much arousing pleasure as she felt, and the curse had delivered.)<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Kyle and Jen both said at once in climax, Kyle&#39;s stallionhood spilling its much smaller volume of seed without the benefit of Jen&#39;s huge balls.</p>
