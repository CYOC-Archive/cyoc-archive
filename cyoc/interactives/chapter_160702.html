<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been almost two weeks since James revealed his new figure to his family and since then he hadn’t really ventured out into the public eye much. He could tell just by opening his door whether or not Henry and Jess were in the living area, even though they spent most of their time in their new barn. Jess had knocked on his door a week ago, offering to show him through their new space which he had agreed too. It felt odd, being out in a shared room. He couldn’t help but stare at his sisters protruding breasts and not think of his own. What annoyed him more was that it wasn’t just a sense of unease that he got, but it was one of inadequacy; his were smaller. Jess had changed her clothes, changing into something that most certainly wasn’t hers. It was a yellow sundress that hung loosely in some place, but most certainly tighter in others. It hung down to her knees and looked comfortable enough save for the strain that it looked to be putting on her breasts and udder. There was no modesty with either of them, her nipples standing erect and visible against the fabric.<br />
<br />
His father greeted him with a nervous smile, one that James returned in kind as Jess happily strolled throughout their straw laden paradise. What was immediately noticeable was the smell, his father and his sister occupied the space alone, so why did it smell so… Barn like? James noticed that Jess looked a little rounder, even with her changes. He had to assume that the two of them were still using bathrooms, after all there weren&#39;t really any obvious signs of waste.It wasn’t until James watched Jess tail lift up and a low pitched rumble emit from her rear that he found the likely source. His sister immediately spun on the spot, her hands flailing through the air in an attempt to dissipate the smell. Her body jiggled and her face turned crimson red as she rambled off an apology while her hands shot up and gripped her fuzzy ears. “I’mSoSorry!”. But even as she was apologizing she felt her stomach gurgle again. Her tail raised up once more and she passed even more wind. Her hands shot to her face as she covered it, Henry quickly ran to comfort her, rubbing her shoulders gently. &quot;It&#39;s okay!!&quot; James quickly replied, feeling like the guilty party. He took a step backwards, before freezing in place. Jess finally peeled her hands away, looking a little more dejected than she was before. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s getting more instinctual…&quot; She mumbled to a confused James. &quot;Earlier this week I caught myself eating hay, I don&#39;t even know why I did it! I remember I was feeling hungry and grabbed some before I could even think about it. Ever since I&#39;ve been craving it, and eventually I just gave in… But it&#39;s started to have an effect. I hope I didn&#39;t gross you out…&quot; Jess explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;N-not at all!&quot; James replied, closing the distance a little between them. He furrowed his brow, looking for the right words. &quot;You… don&#39;t seem like the person to let that bother you. As strange as it is. You seem... Confident, even with all that&#39;s changed.&quot; James trailed off, rubbing the back of his head nervously, but he could see his words had struck a chord with his sister. Her disposition changed and the embarrassment melted away. Her chest stuck out now with an odd sense of pride. <br />
<br />
Jess nodded in response. &quot;You know what? You&#39;re right!&quot; <br />
<br />
She felt good all of a sudden, James’ approval made her feel less worried about the little things.<br />
<br />
“I might not be able to control what’s happening to my body, but I can control how I deal with it.” She mustered. “Thank you James - But there was something I’ve been working on, something I wanted to show you. Here, look at these.”<br />
<br />
Jess led James towards her desk, showing him the books that she and Henry had recovered from the wall. Explaining that she’s been trying to decipher them for days, but hasn’t had much luck. James took a brief look, flicking through the pages, but even on the best of days he was never that academically minded. “I wish I could help… But that means nothing to me.” He sighed, wishing he could place more hope in those books. “Ah don’t worry about it. Was worth a shot.” Jess shrugged. “I’ll keep at it. I’m sure I’ll crack it.” She said half heartedly.<br />
<br />
The three said their goodbyes as James left for his room, shutting the barn door behind him, but not before hearing one last bellow of Wind from his sister, only this time a small giggle followed.<br />
<br />
James spent the rest of the week thinking on the advice that he had accidentally given to his sister. “I can control… How I deal with this…” He repeated, growing frustrated with his indecision. &quot;How do I do that? I don&#39;t know what I want to do… I need a sign…&quot; He sighed while leaning out the window. He stared out into the horizon, looking for any sign of movement along the forest&#39;s edge. <br />
<br />
“Dakota where are you…” He moaned, his rear swaying in the air. “You’re the sign I need. Come back for me… Show me how....” He moaned, feeling a strange moistness in his loins. A blush spread across his cheeks, one that couldn&#39;t be so easily extinguished by the cool evening breeze. His hand reached back, his fingers traced gently across his rear before digging hard into his pants as he tried to grip them, to pull them down. &quot;Show me how…&quot; James repeated, the image of her erect shaft stormed his mind, quickly followed by thoughts of his new sex. His female sex. His hands had wiggled his pants loose, his cheeks baring to the air, his fingers liked and prodded while his other hand supported him against the window frame. Finally he felt the edges of his sex, moist to the touch and practically drooling for attention. &quot;Show me how to be a woman!&quot; James groaned through gritted teeth, his fingers dangling on the precipice. He wanted this, but still he somehow resisted.<br />
<br />
Then came the knock on the door.</p>
