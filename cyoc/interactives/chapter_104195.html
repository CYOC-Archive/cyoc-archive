<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was by then all goat as his physical form, he having got there by his witch of a sister scheming to be rid of him, poisoned him with a potion. Then, and after he had changed mostly into a goatish embodiment, his own mother in a fit of rage added her witchery damning to his predicament, and changed of him what remained still as physically human to make him as if he were born a buck goat. Passions of a goat are but instincts brought on by the scent of females, and Dan began to use that as his desire to live his new life. He walked away from Kat, leaving her to become as devil fodder, while giving up any idea of his ever being human again, deciding to be then what he was, an animal goat, male, doing what to him felt natural.<br />
<br />
Kat was at about that same time her brother was giving up all hopes, she was feeling the power of a devil binding her to him and his wants, rather than he as a familiar being bound to follow and protect a sworn-vowed witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katherine, the best way for you to begin you becoming as mine, is for you to feel the sexual heat like would a bitch dog. As you swoon for any male to quell your inner lusts, I shall begin causing your body to change and become the same as is mine. I will like our new arrangement, as I am sure you shall learn to appreciate me every evening. Now let us begin, as first I note the need to arrange you skeletally, while flesh, skin, muscles, tendons, and teeth become canine.&quot; Mason said, as he did begin a stare at Katherine, focusing his powers upon a witch becoming a victim of magic.<br />
<br />
As Katherine began to moan from her sudden new sensations of sexual wants, she heard and felt as her bones creaked or snapped, her legs hunching her into a animalistic stance. She felt her spine begin to wriggle, as her tail bone sprouted new links, growing on her the bony tail of a Mastiff dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh Mason I feel so..., is this what Daniel felt when I caused his body to change?&quot; Kat asked of her devil familiar, she never to before then having wanted to change her form as she had done to others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no, as for you your sense of passion is worse than what Daniel felt by becoming a buck goat. He feeling his genitals grow and changing their positioning made him swoon with delight, as many a male human wished his male parts were more like those living in the animal kingdom. His sexual swooning caused him to accept his situation, as you dear girl, shall feel dire fear as you become more a dog than you were a human female.<br />
<br />
I can imagine our first night with you as my bitch, as we had sex on your human standards in your bed, but as my bitch we shall do it standing anywhere we are, with me rutting you, my cock-knot holding you to me as mine to do as I so please. You moaned when in bed and with me as mated, but when we are dogs together, you shall howl, whine, and drool.<br />
<br />
In a moment you shall feel as tens of thousands of pins were pricking your skin, while of fact that is as your coat of Mastiff fur shall coat you in furred comfort. I deem your perky breasts to flatten until at such time when pregnant with my devil-pups that you must wean them. What was weak if smooth sensual skin shall be as tougher animal hide, especially the skin about your neck and along your spin. Whine now like the dog as you feel your ears growing, your skull conforming, that cute nose and your mouth merging, becoming the muzzle of a Mastiff dog.<br />
<br />
Enjoy these special minutes as your body and lifestyle shall permanently change, as you become for me a playmate bitch, and I gain new status to begin my dominating you. What we shall have by being of kind is more like what you did by toying with men, and demeaning them when you changed their penises to look like those of a horse on Steve, a pony of Fred, a goat for Dan, and the best one was that escaped prisoner, when you helped him find a place to hide, he going to the zoo to become there a horny zebra stallion.<br />
<br />
You recall how you went to the zoo and standing with the people outside the zebra enclosure, that one male zebra came close and to your staring eyes he presented you a view of how his cock had changed to delight him in his living a life of bestial anonymity. You seeing his cock had you wishing to become a zebra mare and feel the lengths sink into you depths, but you left him there being an animal, he behind bars and a tall fence.<br />
<br />
Yes dear, try some stretching exercise your body as it changes, have a look at what a moment ago were hands, are now paws, as pink painted fingernails became brown toenails, your thumb being a dewclaw.<br />
<br />
Whine and wish you never had accepted my kind offer that you begin as become like me, and live every night of your long life being for me my mate. By day you shall look like other humans, as beautiful in their eyes a young woman so well endowed. While all the while acting as if you were human, knowing that come sundown, you be then mine to rut and do with as I please.</p>
