<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Anna accepted the notification and seemed to freeze for several seconds before, grinning and then addressing Josh. &quot;Suite 5 have requested the presence of a staff member. That&#39;s the Korean couple we met earlier in the day. I will get to utilise my language skills&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you surmise that? I didn&#39;t see or hear anything&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The request somehow went straight into my mind when I pressed the button below the light. I don&#39;t know how it works, but it does. The technology at play here is very impressive&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it&#39;s like the alarm that came to me to tell me to go to this wing. So what happens now? There are no other lights flashing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can either wait here. This office is for the use of staff only. However, since you haven&#39;t had an orientatio, why not come with me. It&#39;s all very simple really. You just listen to the guests requests then do what you can to make it happen. If you can do something, that voice in your mind will tell you to&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did come here to be with you and I don&#39;t mind trying an Age transformation. So yeah that sounds like a good idea&quot;<br />
<br />
It only took a few seconds to walk down the hall to Suite 5. Anna knocked on the door to announce their presence. It was quickly opened by an elderly Asian man. Anna addressed him in what Josh knew was Korean. She spoke so fast so that even though Josh knew a bit of Korean, the only words he recognised were &#39;Anna&#39; and &#39;Kate&#39;. The man ushered them in and saw there was an elderly woman also in the room. He took a moment to visit his VIP white space and enhanced his ability to understand and speak Korean.<br />
<br />
When Josh emerged back into the real world he understood what the Korean man was saying. <br />
<br />
&quot;...... earlier today in the foyer. I did not realise you were staff members. I very much appreciated your help. Do you recall my my wife Eun Ae?&quot; He gestured to the Asian woman &quot;Perhaps you don&#39;t recognise her or myself. We thought we would try being 75 years old for the afternoon&quot;<br />
<br />
The elderly woman spoke up &quot;Greetings Anna and Kate&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Eun Ae&quot; Anna replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Is not Kate a woman&#39;s name?&quot; asked Eun Ae<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm.... Yes it is&quot; replied Josh. He really didn&#39;t want to explain why he was assuming a woman&#39;s name, but he didn&#39;t want to lie.<br />
<br />
&quot;She must be gender swapped dearest, like that couple we met earlier&quot; replied the man. &quot;Do you work in the gender wing Kate?&quot;<br />
<br />
While Josh was contemplating how to answer Anna answered for him &quot;We all have shifts in all the different wings of the resort. Gender swapping is an everyday occurrence if you work here. I was a teenage boy during the afternoon&quot;<br />
<br />
Eun Ae let out a giggle &quot;Maybe we should visit that wing on our next vacation? What do you say Si-woo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. He&#39;s embarrassed!&quot; Eun Ae replied and giggled again. &quot;But enough small talk. We requested help because we have had enough of being old. Your body hurts all over. We now want to try being kids again, 6 year old&#39;s to be precise, but when we tried to make that change we were rejected and were told we need a guardian. How does that work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just resort policy. Occupational health and safety requirements stipulate that anyone under 10 year&#39;s old need an adult guardian. If just one of you requested to be a child the other could be their parent&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we want to be young together. We want to play kid&#39;s games&quot; replied Si-woo.<br />
<br />
Anna replied. &quot;That&#39;s fine. You can both regress to 6 year&#39;s old. I and Kate could be your guardians. You just need to make the request&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that sounds good to me&quot; replied Eun Ae. &quot;I am so happy there are staff members who can speak our language. I am very impressed&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank-you Eun Ae. We are here to assist you in any way we can&quot; replied Anna. Did you want to be a brother and sister? If so we could be your parents&quot;<br />
<br />
The two Korean&#39;s looked each other in the eye before Eun Ae replied. &quot;I think we would prefer to just be friends. We would like to retain our own identities&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, we are in the right place. Just imagine you are both 6 year&#39;s old and the changes will occur&quot; <br />
<br />
Josh watched in amazement as the Korean couple de-aged. In less than a minute the two were once more a twenty something, newly married couple. Then they became teenagers, before beginning to shrink. Their cloths shrunk with them. Before another minute had passed the couple had become 6 year old kids.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! This technology is impressive!&quot; exclaimed Si-woo. He clutched his throat, not used to having a child&#39;s voice. &quot;Is there anything other than change our ages that we can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not unless you upgrade your package, and I&#39;m afraid the resort is at capacity this weekend. Maybe for your next holiday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we can request that you change can&#39;t we?&quot; asked Eun Ae<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly&quot; replied Anna. But you can&#39;t request changes that would make us unable to fulfil our jobs. You could make one of us a kid but one of us would need to remain an adult to be your guardian&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could we make you older? Could one of you be my mother? I never knew my mother. She died when I was an infant and I have no memory of her. Just a photo&quot; asked Eun Ae.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so sad&quot; replied Josh<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s horrible&quot; added Anna. &quot;You can make either of us older. Just tell us the age you want us to be&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mother would have been 33 when I was last this age&quot; replied Eun Ae<br />
<br />
&quot;My mother was 45 when I was 6&quot; replied Si-woo &quot;My parents married late&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So would you like myself and Kate to change our ages?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes please&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh unexpectedly found himself in his white space. A voice in his mind told him. &quot;A guest has requested you age to 45 year&#39;s old. It is your duty to comply&quot; It seemed as a staff member he had no option. He made the changes to himself. When he came out of his trance he saw that Anna had aged as well. He then glanced at a mirror and saw himself. He had retained his extra height and fitness but he now had some grey hairs around his temples and a slightly weathered face. He did look to be 45.</p>
