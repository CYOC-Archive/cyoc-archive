<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BACKTRACKING...<br />
Lila Carpenter and her boyfriend returned to his house, a place they now shared and an arrangement she hoped would continue as part of a permanent relationship.<br />
Lila was deeply in love with Lance Knight, and she knew he felt the same about her. She had picked up enough from their conversations in recent days to know that at some point he intended to propose. Lila wasn&#39;t sure when, but knew her answer would be a resounding &quot;YES!&quot;, despite the fact she couldn&#39;t stand his brother and sister-in-law, and that Lance and her brother were neutral at best.<br />
There was some debate over who would drive them back home, but in the end Lance won, pointing out the fact that he hadn&#39;t altered his car insurance yet to include her on the policy.<br />
&quot;Besides, you had a rough day making that discovery,&quot; he added, not wanting to go into more detail about Lila finding Debbie&#39;s dead body during Julie&#39;s successful escape attempt from the Elders&#39; Council.<br />
&quot;True, but all that stress dealing with her trial...&quot; she began.<br />
&quot;It was trying for all of us,&quot; he said, kissing her gently. &quot;Let&#39;s go home,&quot; Lance suggested, which Lila agreed to by expressing a happy purr.<br />
<br />
Since it was well after dark and the Were Alert had been lifted, Lance and Lila never bothered to change back into their human forms. They just gathered their things and hopped in his car as the werepanther drove his weretigress home.<br />
But as they approached their destination, the couple discovered their night wasn&#39;t over yet.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s Rick doing here?&quot; she wondered aloud, seeing her brother&#39;s pick up parked at the curb.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; replied Lance, as he waved a paw at the man before pulling into his driveway.<br />
The answer, after they parked and got out of Lance&#39;s car was, &quot;I put the snow tires on your motorcycle liked you ask me too, but couldn&#39;t try to deliver it before now because of that dang Were Alert,&quot; said Rick, getting out of his truck and walking toward the rear of the vehicle after greeting his sister and just nodding to acknowledge her beau.<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s been a long day for all of us,&quot; agreed Lila, as she walked to the back of the truck with him.<br />
&quot;Been waiting long?&quot; wondered Lance.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; was Rick&#39;s curt reply, but a quick werepanther paw on the truck hood revealed that it was stone cold.<br />
<i>Liar. You&#39;re either worried about her with me or just concerned about Lila period,</i> realized Lance, as he joined the siblings as they pulled the red motorcycle out of the back of the truck.<br />
&quot;Okay. Give her a quick spin if you don&#39;t mind. Then I&#39;ll be on my way home,&quot; said Rick, handing Lila her keys and helmet back.<br />
A smile crossed Lila&#39;s muzzle as she donned the helmet and prepared to take off. &quot;Once around the block should do it. I&#39;m not quite familiar with this neighborhood yet,&quot; she said, starting the engine.<br />
&quot;You tuned it too!&quot; Lila realized, hearing the motor idle.<br />
&quot;Yep. You were starting to run a little rough,&quot; confirmed Rick. Then, seeing Lance standing there, he asked, &quot;So, justice been served yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;For the most part,&quot; replied the werepanther. &quot;The sentencing phase is tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good. Two counts of violating Statute 1-A is nothing to be taken lightly,&quot; said Rick.<br />
Lance agreed, as Lila waved at the men in her life and drove off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, while we&#39;re alone for a moment, I&#39;d like to ask you something,&quot; said Lance, to which Rick looked at him suspiciously, since he was still in his human form.<br />
&quot;Do you have any way to contact your parents? Lila said they were doing missionary work with weretigers somewhere in Africa.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not directly. We can send letters, but no promise as to when they&#39;d be answered. Why?&quot; Rick asked in return.<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m going to ask Lila to marry me soon, and I&#39;d think it be a good idea to have them here for the wedding next year,&quot; revealed Lance.<br />
&quot;SERIOUSLY?&quot; said Rick, eyeing him closely.<br />
&quot;Yes. Why?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s just that... well, none of the men in Lila&#39;s life before you have ever reached that point. Their approach has been more along the lines of <i>Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free</i>,&quot; said her brother, bluntly.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not like that,&quot; said Lance. &quot;I truly love her, and Lila loves me. If she says yes, I want to spend the rest of my life with her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; said Rick, leaning against his pick up. &quot;I still don&#39;t trust that brother of yours, but maybe I&#39;ve got you all wrong,&quot; he admitted.<br />
&quot;Truthfully? I don&#39;t trust Benton a lot of times either,&quot; confessed Lance. &quot;But he&#39;s family, so what can you do?&quot; he asked, while shrugging his shoulders.<br />
&quot;I understand. When do you think you&#39;ll ask her?&quot;<br />
&quot;Probably Christmas Day. Then we can make wedding arrangements at our leisure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, personally, I think our parents just went to Africa so they could run free with other weretigers. After all, not everyone can afford a fancy retirement plan,&quot; said Rick, getting in a dig about how rich weres went off to private islands when they &#39;retired&#39;. &quot;Besides, they were only in their late 80s when they left, so would be barely close to 100 now, so personally I always thought they just went for a long but cheap vacation.&quot;<br />
Lance didn&#39;t tell him that Lila thought the reason their folks left was to have sex in the wild. Instead, he said, &quot;So, when do you think you&#39;ll hear from them?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmmm... if I mail the letter by Monday of next week, maybe sometime by the end of January if we&#39;re lucky. No cable, phone, or Internet out there,&quot; pointed out Rick.<br />
&quot;I understand. I trust you can keep this just between us until I officially ask Lila?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll write the letter at work tomorrow, because if my wife finds out...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know what you mean. Some of my best reporters are female,&quot; replied Lance, as they heard the sound of a returning motorcycle grow louder.<br />
<br />
&quot;She runs like a dream,&quot; purred Lila, stopping in front of them.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Rick, closing up his tailgate. &quot;Just stop by the garage sometime and we&#39;ll settle up. Night sis,&quot; he added, giving her a quick hug before getting in his truck and driving away.<br />
&quot;Did he treat you all right while I was gone?&quot; she asked Lance when they were alone.<br />
&quot;Sure. No reason not to. Was there?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Want a ride? It&#39;s a rush riding at night with the wind rustling your fur,&quot; said Lila, as her tail twitched happily.<br />
&quot;Not at the moment. I need to get you on my car insurance and other policies, and you need to acquire me a helmet before I can legally be your passenger,&quot; pointed out Lance.<br />
&quot;Dang. You&#39;re right,&quot; she pouted, getting off the motorcycle to walk it up to the garage. &quot;Well, as soon as we get inside, there&#39;s one ride I&#39;m looking forward to giving you,&quot; said Lila, as she reached a paw out to caress her boyfriend&#39;s growing cock.<br />
&quot;A trip I hope never ends,&quot; Lance said, before giving his lady a passionate kiss.<br />
<br />
Once the happy couple was inside their home and Lance took care of the security system, they never made it to the bedroom.<br />
Lila was bent over the couch, shaking her shapely rear at her lover.<br />
Lance growled in delight as his werepanther penis entered her, and Lila purred in time with its barbs stroking her love channel.<br />
Soon the couple was passionately rolling around on the floor, alternating who was on top of who until both fell asleep in each others furry arms from pleasurably relieving their stress while declaring their love once more.</p>
