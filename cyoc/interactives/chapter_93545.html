<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vickie was able to sleep well despite the soreness in her throat, eventually it seemed to fade away halfway through the night and she sighed contentedly in her sleep as the pain receded from her throat. David tossed and turned as the worries in his head played out through his dreams, never quite allowing him to truly fall into a peaceful slumber. The morning arrived far too quickly for him, but Vickie was feeling much better as she opened her eyes and looked out the window at the rising sun. As Vickie started to squirm and fidget, David looked over at her to see her eyes moving around the room tiredly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sweetie, how are you feeling?&quot; he asked her as she sat up in the bed.<br />
<br />
Vickie rubbed the sleep out of her eyes, and noticed that the pain in her throat was completely gone, as though it had never been there in the first place. As a poor trade though, the pain in her head had returned, but not quite as intense as before. In addition, her legs felt....well...the same. Hairy and itchy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta say, some sleep felt really go...&quot; she started to say excitedly before gasping in surprise.<br />
<br />
David was surprised too, her voice had gotten deeper over the night. Her normal pitch was somewhere around a high alto but this...this sounded like a boy who was quickly changing from his child&#39;s voice down to a deeper tenor or baritone. <br />
<br />
Vickie was surprised for the exact same reason, she wasn&#39;t at all expecting her voice to come out like that and she threw a hand up to her throat in surprise. The bigger surprise was the lump she now felt under her chin and she jerked her hand away from that as well the moment she felt it. David noticed all of this as well, from his point of view he could now see the (fairly decently sized) protruding bump in her throat. Vickie gulped and her enlarged adam&#39;s apple bobbed up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad...what&#39;s wrong with my voice? It doesn&#39;t hurt anymore...but I don&#39;t think I should sound like this!&quot; the pitch of her voice increasing, but still never quite returning to the way it had been before.<br />
<br />
At this point, David was fairly certain his &quot;insane&quot; theory wasn&#39;t so insane anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Honey&quot; he started, &quot;This may sound strange but I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re turning into....a boy....&quot;<br />
<br />
Vickie started to inhale really quickly and she jumped out of bed. &quot;No no no no no...I can&#39;t be. That doesn&#39;t even make any sense!!&quot;<br />
<br />
David got out of bed as well, and quickly noticed something else. &quot;Actually Vickie, I think it might be true, look at this.&quot; As he walked over to Vickie she noticed something else, he wasn&#39;t quite as tall as he normally was. Normally he towered over her and she had to look up from about chest level, but now she was at least an inch or two taller. As she looked down she could see the skin between her top and her bottom pajamas, even though they had been slightly too large for her before.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?!&quot; Vickie was pacing around, apparently unable to sit still. &quot;I can&#39;t turn into a...a boy! I&#39;m only 13! This can&#39;t be happening! What&#39;ll my friends think!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave it to a 13 year old girl to worry about what her friends would think in the middle of this situation.&quot; David was thinking to himself. He couldn&#39;t think of any solutions himself, but he didn&#39;t want to sit around and wait for this thing to finish. &quot;Let&#39;s go see if we can find a doctor, surely we can do something to stop this from spreading.&quot; David was already getting up and ready to leave, grabbing some clothes.<br />
<br />
Vickie started to do the same when she realized something unfortunate. &quot;Dad! I...I can&#39;t fit in my normal stuff!&quot; Most of her stuff had been starting to get a little bit small anyways. She had been planning to go with her mother to purchase some new clothes after this trip (something she&#39;d been looking forward to more honestly) but now it was obvious that they should have gone before the trip. Aside from her undergarments, nothing was quite right. Her pajamas were a good indicator of how well her other clothes now fit. <br />
<br />
David looked around, &quot;Isn&#39;t there anything you can wear for a few minutes while we find a doctor? Surely something fits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, nothing...&quot; Vickie was trying clothes on almost in rapid fire, trying one shirt or pair of jeans and finding that they just didn&#39;t QUITE fit.<br />
<br />
David threw his new shirt on and went to the door. &quot;I&#39;ll run downstairs and grab some of those bigger tourist t-shirts. You can wear your pajama bottoms honestly if you need to.&quot; <br />
<br />
As he slammed the door shut, Vickie collapsed on the bed, wearing only her undergarments and pajama top as tears started to form at her eyes. Why was this happening to her? This was a disaster!<br />
<br />
The pain that had been in her head, but mostly forgotten in the panic now rushed forward again, almost staggering her with its intensity. She pushed her head down into the pillows again as her body started to ache. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh god!&quot; she exclaimed in her deeper voice. This pain was worse than anything before. Instead of being focused in a single spot this time she mostly just HURT. All of her body was rebelling against her it felt like. She started to breathe deeply in order to deal with the pain. It wasn&#39;t just pain though. she felt more than that. She felt almost...bloated? That was the best word she could use to describe it. She could almost feel her body pulsing on it&#39;s own.<br />
<br />
The pain was something else, it dampened her to almost all other things, but she did still notice when her dad came back into the room, rushing inside with a gaudy plastic bag tucked under his arm. <br />
<br />
As he looked at her lying on the bed he noticed the expression on her face. &quot;Vickie? Are you okay? What&#39;s wrong now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vickie tried to answer, but she just couldn&#39;t...the pain was just in the way. Completely blocking her from doing anything else. And then suddenly....it was gone.<br />
<br />
Vickie opened her eyes, breathing deeply. She slowly got up and wobbled on her feet for a second. &quot;I think...I&#39;m okay. Everything was just hurting so bad for a few minutes. I could barely even think...&quot;<br />
<br />
David looked over her quickly, he didn&#39;t notice anything different about her this time. She was still the same height and still looked as frightened as when he left. He sighed and handed her the bag. &quot;I think that this should work, you don&#39;t need to look decent, we just need to get you to the doctor quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vickie nodded and took the bag from her dad. As she started to change she DID start to notice something different, before she had been using a training bra and she had only just begun to start needing it. As she took off her pajama top she moaned and cried back at her dad. &quot;Dad! I don&#39;t think you don&#39;t need to turn away now...&quot;<br />
<br />
David turned around and saw what his daughter was referring to, her bra looked oddly sad on her frame. Her chest looked decidedly male, no longer having her mother&#39;s growing figure. He hadn&#39;t noticed before as she now just looked a bit lanky her chest looking thin and empty. Vickie was dejectedly unhooking her training bra, throwing it onto the bed in disgust. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this! I just started using that!&quot;<br />
<br />
As David ran his eyes over Vickie again, he looked for ANY small changes that he had missed before. Nothing yet, but he was getting worried about how fast the changes seemed to be accelerating. He really wanted answers and he wanted them NOW. &quot;Hurry up and throw that shirt on, we need to get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vickie sniffed and nodded, throwing the shirt over her head. As she started to put her pajama bottoms back on her headache came back. &quot;Oh come ON...&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is your head hurting again?&quot; David exclaimed. He was starting to quickly sense a pattern to Vickie&#39;s illness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s like the last one but...UGH!!&quot; she fell back quickly into one of the chairs in the room, breathing incredibly hard and looking rough. Unlike the other times, she seemed fairly quick to recover this time. She stood up and grimaced in pain. &quot;Dad...I think I need to use the bathroom first, I feel sort of...&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t quite get to finish her sentence before she ran towards the bathroom, putting herself down near the toilet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you queasy now? What are you feeling?&quot; David was just trying to keep up at this point, he&#39;d closed the door again to give Vickie some privacy. He wanted to leave, but he knew Vickie would need to be at least somewhat stable before they could get out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it feels...a little bit like a need to throw up.&quot; Vickie had quickly thrown her hair up into some semblance of a ponytail, getting it out of her face as she panted on the tile of the bathroom. As she leaned over the porcelain, she felt the urges come up again quickly. &quot;Ohhh...lord....I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m feeling right now. It just feels wrong, like my insides are burning up!&quot;<br />
<br />
David looked for something to help Vickie, but there was nothing he could think of. He just sat with her for a few minutes as she sat there dry-heaving and just feeling awful. After about 15 minutes, she sat up, looking exhausted and sweaty and went back into the main room to lie back down on the bed. As much as David wanted to, he couldn&#39;t force her to leave right now. Obviously this was going to be the worst part for her. Whatever was coming up next was going to be rough.</p>
