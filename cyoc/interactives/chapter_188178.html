<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trip back home was much faster with Mark riding atop his brother Paul, who was now a draft horse.  Within a day, they arrived home.  The sun was setting, and Mark dismounted his brother, glad to be back.  His parents and brother came out to meet them, marvelling at the strong, sturdy draft horse that Paul had become.  Mother had tears in her eyes, this was going to take some getting used to.  Father checked his son&#39;s teeth, and inspected his son like he would any animal.  Then when he was satisfied, he petted his son on the side.  &quot;Good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sun lowered behind the hills. and it was then that something went very wrong.  The horse whinneyed and  fidgeted as he was brought to the barn, and suddenly fell on his side, struggling wildly on the ground - legs flailing about.  Father backed away, in order not to get kicked by his son; he knew such a blow would easily be fatal to him.  &quot;Paul!  What&#39;s wrong, my boy?  Paul!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing the commotion, the whole family came running to join their father, watching helpessly as Paul struggled helplessly on the grass.  Then slowly something started happening to the large draft-horse.  One hoof changed... reshaping itself slowly.... it started looking like a foot.  Then one ear started squatting flat to the horse&#39;s head, losing its point and rounding out, looking strangely like a human ear.  Then it happened to one hand, an eye... the horse&#39;s tail started shrinking smaller, and its torso began losing mass and shrinking.<br />
<br />
It was the strangest thing, watching what was a draft horse slowly regaining its original human form, part by piece.  The had started growwing less elongated, mane receding, patches of fur receding in various places.  It&#39;s belly shief disappeared and a horse-sized fully hard cock flopped about, looking more human by the second.  It whinnied and whined, and when it was more human than horse, it started spurting cum all over the place.  Paul&#39;s changes accellerated, mostly human face now, mostly human hands and feet... he couldn&#39;t stop himself from crying out, &quot;David!&quot; as he continued to shoot out cum in all directions, his still-large cock flailing about like it had a mind of its own.<br />
<br />
The whole family put their arms up, backing quickly away to try to spare themselves being hit by horse semen, looking confused by the name Paul kept crying out. <br />
<br />
Finally, Paul stopped.  His transformation back to human was complete.  His chest went up and down like a drum, rhytmic, while he regained his breath.  &quot;Oh my god,&quot; was all he could say weakly.<br />
<br />
Mother was the first at his side, wiping cum away, and covering him with her shawl.  &quot;Oh my boy, oh my boy, are you okay my little Paul?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Paul answered between breaths, now beet read and clearly embarrassed by his show.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Mark wanted to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, &quot;Paul answered weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is David?&quot; Father asked, still confused.<br />
<br />
Paul got even redder.  &quot;I...&quot; He hesitated, not understanding what happened.  &quot;...don&#39;t know,&quot; He finished weakly.<br />
<br />
Mother helped Paul to the barn and Father hosed him off.  Mother made a  fuss of it, drying him with a clean cloth.  Paul was beet red the whole time, then suddenly an apparition appeared - it was the form of the Madame Illusia floatin in mid air before the family.  &quot;Hello dear family.  I met your son earlier, with his most noble request to help you,&quot; the Madame explained.  &quot;Because of his noble request, I could not leave him changed forever.  So I took mercy on him, and made it so that he will be a were-horse of sorts.  During the daylight hours, Paul will take the form of a draft horse, allowing you to keep your farm and prosper.  But when the sun goes down, Paul will return to his human form for the night, so that he need not be imprisoned in the body of a beast forever and always, but still have the life of the fine young man that he is.  Just be warned, the changes will happen every sundown and sunrise - so always be prepared, lest anything unfortunate befall anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But -&quot; Paul started to protest, to no avail as the form of the Madame Illusia evaporated in mid-air after her decree of mercy, like a mirage in summer heat.  Paul&#39;s parents were hugging him, happy that they would still have time with their son.  It didn&#39;t go unnoticed by his brothers that Paul seemed strangely and disturbingly disappointed by this turn of events, and even troubled.<br />
<br />
That night, Pauls parents and brothers rejoiced - they would be able to keep the farm ad prosper thanks to Paul.  As the last embers of the fire crackled in the fire place, and family filed out one by one to retire to their beds, it was only Mark that remained with Paul, silent and pensive.  After what seemed like a very long time, Mark spoke quietly to Paul.  &quot;You were disappointed.  You were actually disappointed that you changed back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul squirmed a little in his seat.  It was true, he had always had a fantasy of unwillingly being forced intot he form of a draft horse.  It was his family&#39;s unfortunate circumstances that gave him the inn he needed to see that fantasy come true, while at the same time helping them to survive.  They both sat quietly for a time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s David Baker, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Mark asked his brother.  They had been playmates when they were younger, and friends.<br />
<br />
Paul squirmed some more.  &quot;I.... I don&#39;t know what happened.  I just thought of David when I was...&quot;  Paul couldn&#39;t say any more.  The thought of David riding him, petting him, of doing all kinds of things with him... simply excited Paul.  It never had before tonight, but when the changes started, for some reason he was thinking of David and couldn&#39;t hold back cumming right in front of his entire family, cock flopping around in plain sight.<br />
<br />
Quiet.  Then Mark spoke thoughtfully.  &quot;I know you&#39;re not that way... or at least didn&#39;t used to be.  But I heard guys talking there, at the tent where Madame Illusia was.  I didn&#39;t understand at the time.  But it sounded like the guys.... you know... liked guys... in a too friendly kind of way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul squirmed again.  He knew it was true, he was attracted to guys now.  He never had been before, but something about the magic had done it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard someone say it was &#39;gay night&#39;.  I just thought they were all happy.  I didn&#39;t realize...&quot; Mark stopped.  Then slowly, he continued.  &quot;You like other boys now, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul looked away from Mark, to the fire.  &quot;I... I can&#39;t seem to stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the magic,&quot; Mark said simply.  &quot;I guess you can always hope that David feels the same way about you that you feel about him now,&quot; Mark offered weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to get some sleep.  I&#39;m tired.&quot;  Paul went to bed, realizing his fantasy had come true in the last ways he expected, with unforeseen twists.  One thing was for sure, his life was going to be very different from now on... and he found himself hoping that Mark was right, that perhaps David would like Paul the way Paul liked David.  He found himself getting hard as he thought about it, and drifted off to dreams of David riding him in the nude.<br />
<br />
It was when first light came that a particularly vivid dream of David riding Paul awoke the lad, as he cummed powerfully all over his room, body shifting and changing as he again transformed into a draft horse.</p>
