<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen starts waddling into the building when her stomach growls. She realized that she never got to have breakfast and feels herself tearing up. But then to her surprise, she suddenly lifted up off of the ground as Freida moved her finger. She put an arm around Jen and then the other, catching her and then adjusted herarms to better hold Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like someone&#39;s hungry. Well, it may not be a 5 star meal, but I have plenty of it. So, breakfast is served I guess.&quot; Chuckled Freida as she pulled one of her boobs out the top of her dress. Jen went wide eyed, but found herself bringing her lips towards the puffy nipple. She latched on and began suckling, pulling out the milk from within.<br />
<br />
It tasted better than she expected, so she didn&#39;t stop until she was full. When she stopped, Jen was surprised to find herself within the classroom, along with a bunch of her friends who were also accompanied by their own personal babysitters. The classroom was clearly one meant for preschoolers or something, but no one seemed to question it either. <br />
<br />
To Jen&#39;s further surprise, Freida no longer looked the same as before. Instead of her normal appearance, she now had the body of a sexy young woman. Not quite MILF territory, but with a body that wouldn&#39;t have a chance of losing if she were to enter a beauty pageant. She still kept her bountiful chest, though her boobs were better shaped and were not sagging in the slightest now. Her appearance even made Jen question her sexuality for a few moments, ultimately deciding that it would be fine if it was with her. <br />
<br />
This made Freida chuckle softly. &quot;Am I really that attractive to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can read minds?&quot; Asked Jen with a shocked look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not with adults, but definitely when it comes to adorable little babies like you. It makes caring for them far easier as it removes the guessing game. And yes, you are considered to be a baby right now; a teenaged baby; but a baby nonetheless. So the mind reading magic does apply to you. And no, I cannot just turn you back to normal. The curse is more powerful than I am if I am just by myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the woman sitting beside them who was apparently was Jen&#39;s friend Ashley&#39;s babysitter, turned and spoke to Freida. &quot;Aww, you got a blonde cutie. What&#39;s her name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yulia, this is Jen, Jen this is Yulia. She is also a witch. Actually, the sitters here are all witches and members of our coven&quot; explains Freida. Jen waves and Yulia smiles and waves back. But then Yulia pauses and looks surprised. &quot;Oh, so it&#39;s you, huh? Now it makes sense why Freida was assigned to you. But don&#39;t worry, Freida is great. So you&#39;re certainly in good hands now. You&#39;re such a precious widdle baby! Oh you are just so cute and adorable in your little onsie! I could just eat you up.&quot; Began gushing Yulia<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Its as you realized. Jen here is the cursed one of the group. And you should try and remember that these girls are not actually babies. They may act and think like them, but that&#39;s because of the curse rewriting their minds to believe this is how things should be. And also, Jen here knows the truth among them, so please just converse with her normally. Though maybe just try to keep it in check, as she is really such an adorable baby girl!&quot; Replied Freida who now also started fawning over Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Witches like babies?&quot; Asked Jen, to which Yulia became even more excited about. &quot;Ahhh, she is just too cute!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know she is! And yes Jen, witches tend to adore babies. Babies have a pure innocence that is rare to find anywhere else. We can inately feel that innocence with our magic and that in tern causes us to feel a feeling similar to excessive excitement and extreme happiness. It gets more apparent in our behavior the longer we spend around babies too. It&#39;s actually a world wide protective magic that was set up centuries ago in order to stop witches from putting curses on innocent newborns when punishing their parents. But it also tends to makes us a little baby crazy and slightly (extremely) protective of them too, so please try and bare with it alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded and tried to not let the situation bother her too much. She at least knew that for the time being, she was safe. The teacher, another stunningly beautiful woman who definitely was prime MILF material, walked in and gathered everyone&#39;s attention. Freida swaps Jen around, and pulls out her other boob for her incase Jen got hungry during the lesson. Jen noticed that most of the other witches did something similar, though a few of them took out bottles and pacifiers instead. <br />
<br />
Jen wasn&#39;t hungry, but she still put the boob into her mouth just to keep herself busy for a bit while the teacher began her lesson. <br />
<br />
Jen woke up with a stir when Freida began to move as the class had ended. She began to cry however and asked Freida to please change her diaper, as she must have wet it during her unexpected nap. After watching the weirdly excited face of Freida change her, Jen was carried out of the classroom and set down on the ground, as Freida returned back to her &quot;alternative&quot; appearance. She then grabbed Jen&#39;s hand and led her out of the building. <br />
<br />
Jen noticed Kyle and some of his friends were approaching them, and tried to hide behind Freida. But Freida had other plans. Kyle noticed Jen and started laughing. &quot;Hahaha! Nice diaper Jen. Did mommy forget to potty train you or what?&quot; He teased. <br />
<br />
Jen felt extremely embarrassed, but didn&#39;t know how to retort. However, she didn&#39;t have to, because contrary to both her and Kyle&#39;s expectations, Kyle suddenly was stopped by his friends. &quot;Woah dude, what the fuck was that about?&quot; Asked one of his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? She&#39;s in high-school and is still wearing a diaper. It&#39;s funny.&quot; Replied Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s just a baby Kyle. Of course she would be wearing a diaper. What baby doesn&#39;t? And our school offers a babysitting service. Don&#39;t you remember the notice that was handed out today?&quot; Corrected one of his female friends, a girl Jen believed was named Stephanie or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why are you picking on a baby man? Are you that insecure or something? Like yeah, we&#39;ve said some crazy stuff before, but this is a whole new level of wrong.&quot; Chastized the last member of his group, a boy Jen knew was named Eric, but didn&#39;t know much else about him personally. <br />
<br />
While Kyle was being chewed out by his friends, Freida just continued walking with Jen until they reached the parking lot, where Freida broke character and began laughing. &quot;What a dumbass. How did he forget his own clause in his curse that made everyone think that you were just a teenaged baby. Like who insults a baby?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen only now realized that she missed her chance at revenge. But she was satisfied for now with the current outcome to not be too disappointed. She would have plenty more chances to get revenge in the future anyways.</p>
