<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You get in your step-father's car and he drives you to the police station. You're extremely uncomfortable with shit in your panties. You just hope that you'll get the chance to get cleaned up soon.<br />
<br />
You arrive at the police station and your step-father leads you to his office. As you pass through the station you hear a couple of officers talking about last night at the clan house. They're talking quietly but you're still able to hear them clearly. Evidently your hearing was much better now.<br />
<br />
Once you're in your step-father's office he closes the door and asks &quot;What the hell is going on? I have reports of people being approached by vampire hunters and being asked to join in a holy crusade to rid this city of the vampire infestation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We vampire hunters do not approach anyone to recruit them for a holy crusade against vampires&quot; Dagger said. &quot;These people are more than likely scam artists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's just great&quot; your step-father said in an exasperated tone. &quot;Not only do we have mysterious deaths to investigate but now we have possible scam artists taking advantage of last night's news report.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll help any way we can&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Sarah&quot; your step-father said, &quot;I don't know what you can do though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we're here if you want us&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
The door opened and in walked a man that looked to be in his late forties early fifties. He had white close cropped hair, brown eyes, a long slim nose, and a mouth that looked like it hadn't smiled in awhile. You guessed that he stood 6 foot 1 with a body like that of a bodybuilder. His shirt was stretched tight against his chest and arms. He asked your step-father &quot;What's going on here Dave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm trying to figure it out myself John&quot; your step-father said. &quot;I guess I should introduce all of you. This is Chief John Taylor. John, this is Sarah, Alice, my granddaughter Megan, my step-daughter Violet, and um... I didn't catch your name miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief Taylor's eyes rested on Dagger and he asked &quot;What are you doing here Daphne? Please tell me that you weren't involved with what happened at the mall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Dad&quot; Dagger said, &quot;I'm sorry to say that I was involved with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you playing vampire hunter again?&quot; Chief Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a vampire hunter Dad&quot; Dagger said, &quot;and you better get used to it because I'm not going to stop. My involvement with the situation at the mall was as a hostage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are no such things as vampires&quot; Chief Taylor said, &quot;therefore you can not be a vampire hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Excuse me sir&quot; you say, &quot;but vampires are real and I can prove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and prove it then&quot; Chief Taylor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at my mouth&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Chief Taylor looks in your open mouth. When you extend your fangs he jumps back and says &quot;Holy Jesus, Mother of God. You're a demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a demon&quot; you say, &quot;just a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that you're a vampire hunter Daphne&quot; Chief Taylor said, &quot;so do something about this vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Violet and her clan aren't like other vampires&quot; Dagger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me that everyone else here is a vampire too&quot; Chief Taylor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I won't&quot; Dagger said.<br />
<br />
At this Chief Taylor paled to a ghostly white and sank down to the floor. He started muttering under his breath.<br />
<br />
Your step-father knelt down by Chief Taylor and said &quot;It's alright John, they're not going to hurt you.<br />
<br />
&quot;H... h... how do you know?&quot; Chief Taylor asked evidently in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;They could have attacked me last night when they were at my house&quot; your step-father said. &quot;They didn't but some lunatic came in and shot Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't put that Megan was shot in your report&quot; Chief Taylor said glaring at your step-father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Megan was dieing and they turned her to keep her alive&quot; your step-father said. &quot;You would have laughed at me if I had put that in my report.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sure that they're not going to harm us?&quot; Chief Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; your step-father answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I trust you Dave&quot; Chief Taylor said as he got up. &quot;Now, we need to question you about some recent killings. We only have two interrogation rooms here. You said that Megan was turned last night so I don't think we'll need to question her. We won't need to question Daphne since she isn't a vampire. Now, when was your step-daughter turned? I'm assuming that it was last night as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure when she was turned&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was two nights ago&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What time was this?&quot; Chief Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Around nine pm&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was talking with Tanya at that time so she couldn't have been turned&quot; Chief Taylor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't Tanya that they turned&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You only have one step-daughter&quot; Chief Taylor said with a confused look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore&quot; your step-father said, &quot;I now have two step-daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Chief Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My step-son was transformed into Violet&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I'll take your word for it&quot; Chief Taylor said. &quot;We may need to question Violet later but not now. How long ago were you other two turned?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was turned 20 years ago&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I was turned 200 years ago&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then we'll definitely need to ask you questions&quot; Chief Taylor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll get a couple of officers to escort you to the interrogation rooms&quot; Chief Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
Chief Taylor left and shortly after four officers came in to escort Sarah and Alice to the interrogation rooms. Your step-father had you and Megan clean up a bit and then wait in his office. It was about two hours before Sarah and Alice came back.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did it go?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I was able to convince them that our clan wasn't responsible for those deaths&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think the ones interrogating were convinced about that&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well hopefully they'll come to the realization that we're not responsible for those killings&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to find the vampires responsible for the killings&quot; you say. &quot;Dad, do you have a description of the vampiress that Alucard slayed and a description of the lady who survived an attack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do&quot; your step-father said, &quot;wait here while I get them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you may not have needed to turn Alucard&quot; Dagger said after your step-father left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes your step-father comes back in and says &quot;I thought that Alucard's description sounded familiar. The descriptions are identical to each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was there anything odd about her when she came in?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she was very insistent that she leave before sun up&quot; your step-father said. &quot;A couple of the officers reported that they couldn't see her reflection in a mirror that she passed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like she was a vampire to me&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Just then Chief Taylor comes back in and says &quot;Sorry to interrupt you Dave. I just wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier to these vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need to apologize Chief Taylor&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak for yourself&quot; Megan grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan, you need to understand that people will be afraid of us&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't mean I have to like it&quot; Megan said crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you don't have to like it&quot; Sarah agreed. &quot;Though people don't need to apologize for being afraid of us the first time they find out what we are. Most people's idea about vampires are that we're soulless, bloodsucking monsters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we're not like that&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No we're not&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door and an officer came in. &quot;Excuse me sir but Kyle would like to see you at the morgue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he say why?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said to tell you that one of the bodies from the mall has the same puncture wounds on his neck as the other victims&quot; the officer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told Sergeant Hadley that the medics were to leave Alucard alone&quot; your step-father said angrily. &quot;He better have a good explanation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you want the medics to leave a dead body alone&quot; Chief Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn't dead&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Chief Taylor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She means that they turned him&quot; your step-father said. &quot;I better get down there. You five want to come along?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we will&quot; Sarah said, &quot;this will give Violet a chance to see the changes to the body while it's still in the process of changing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will Alucard look like?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it has been only two hours since Alice turned him so his skin will probably have smoothed and softened&quot; Sarah said. &quot;He may have shrunk a bit but other than that there shouldn't be much of a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to be interesting seeing Alucard as a six year old girl&quot; your step-father said. &quot;Well, let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was just a few minutes until you reached the morgue. The morgue was in the basement of an old brownstone apartment building.<br />
<br />
Before you could go into the morgue however, you needed to get a visitor pass. Maria was the one that handed out the visitor pass. She was about 20 with short, light brown hair, red eyes which you figured was because of color contacts, a small, pert nose,and thin lips. She was about 5 foot 6 and pretty slim.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Maria&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Lieutenant Carmichael&quot; Maria said. &quot;Who do you have with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your step-father gestured to each of you as he introduced you to Maria. &quot;This is Sarah, my step-daughter Violet, my granddaughter Megan, Alice, and John's daughter Daphne. Everyone, this is Maria Canton.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you&quot; Maria said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you too&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Megan, Sarah, Alice, and Dagger echoed your greeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need some passes&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can give you three passes for Sarah, Alice, and Daphne&quot; Maria said, &quot;but I can't give a pass to either Violet or Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't you do that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because of your age&quot; Maria said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you bend the rules a bit?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but I can't&quot; Maria said, &quot;I'd lose my job if I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take full responsibility&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't do that&quot; Maria said, &quot;I need this job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok Dad&quot; you say, &quot;we'll stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you were 34 just three days ago&quot; your step-father said. &quot;I can understand Megan because she is 13 but you should be able to get a pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am 13 now Dad&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm confused here&quot; Maria said. &quot;How could she have been 34?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's a little hard to explain&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a vampire&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew I sensed something different about you&quot; Maria said. &quot;I'll see what I can do to get you in the morgue. I'll do anything for the vampire masters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't want you to lose your job so don't give them passes&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish&quot; Maria said. &quot;Here are your passes.&quot;<br />
<br />
After they went into the morgue proper Maria asks you &quot;How come you can go around in the daylight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just the type of vampire that we are&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that there are different types of vampires?&quot; Maria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes there are&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;My mythology professor will be excited to hear this&quot; Maria said. &quot;It's been a life long dream of mine to prove the existence of vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You called us your vampire masters&quot; you said. &quot;What did you mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm part of a group that worships vampires&quot; Maria said. &quot;We've been waiting for you to come to us. We hope you'll find us worthy of becoming vampires ourselves. It doesn't matter to us if we have to sleep in coffins. We do sleep in coffins as a matter of fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't sleep in coffins&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then where do you sleep?&quot; Maria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In regular beds&quot; you say. &quot;I'm going to give you some advice. Stop sleeping in the coffins. Right now there is a lot of vampire hysteria out there. Continue sleeping in coffins and you may wind up dead. Also stop wearing those contacts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I need these contacts&quot; Maria said, &quot;I can't see without them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you have clear contacts?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do but not here&quot; Maria said. &quot;What's going on at my house?&quot; Maria turned up the volume on the small TV beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a few minutes ago this was the site of a grisly mass murder&quot; Carrie reported. &quot;Neighbors noticed some people coming out of the house covered in blood and called police. When police arrived they found most of the house's residents laying in coffins with wooden stakes in there chests and their heads cut off. Some of the bodies were also burned. Police say that the students in this house were part of a vampire cult and their killers were so called vampire hunters. Police are withholding the names of the victims pending notification of family members.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria turned the set off and just sat there in shock. You wonder how many students were murdered by these so called vampire hunters. Things were getting worse as time went on.<br />
<br />
When your step-father came out you said &quot;There has been a mass murder just a few minutes ago. It seems like the victims were Maria's house mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were killed while they slept&quot; Maria said staring straight ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Maria&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're all sorry for your loss&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Maria said and then turned to you. &quot;Why couldn't you have come sooner? At least they could have died as vampires and not humans. You should have come sooner.&quot; She got up with tears streaming down her face and slapped you. She then turned to your step-father and began sobbing onto his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Your step-father held her and asked &quot;What is see talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Evidently her and her house mates worshiped vampires&quot; you say. &quot;They had been waiting for us to reveal ourselves and to turn them into vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They even slept in coffins&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you find out about this?&quot; Your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was on the TV&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did they say?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That neighbors saw several people coming out covered in blood and called the police&quot; you say. &quot;They found most of the house's residents staked in coffins with their heads cut off. Some of them were also burned. The report said the students were a vampire cult and their killers were so called vampire hunters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is getting ridiculous&quot; your step-father said. His cell phone rang and he answered it. After a brief conversation he hung up and said &quot;John just told me that the police have received funding for a new department. He asked me to head it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the department?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paranormal Special Investigations&quot; your step-father said. &quot;The good thing about this is I can hire consultants as I see fit. I'm going to retain Sarah and Daphne as consultants. I've heard of a wizard by the name of Jason Dichtorn that I think I'll retain also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may make a suggestion&quot; Sarah said, &quot;I believe that Violet would make a good consultant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she know as much as you do?&quot; your step-father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was really into vampires before I turned her and she knows about as much as I do&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I suppose that since she was older before you turned her I could retain her&quot; your step-father said. &quot;I was told to go to the crime scene as soon as I could get my consultants gathered. We'll have to see if Jason is available for consultation work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, I need you to go back to my house and tell the boys what's going on&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will Head Council&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan, I want you to watch over your mother until we get back&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Alice will be busy watching over Alucard. By the way Alice, what is Alucard's new name going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking of making it Beth&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to go&quot; your step-father said, &quot;I'll send someone to take you back to Sarah's house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure that you can trust them&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; your step-father said.<br />
<br />
You walk out with Sarah, Dagger, and your step-father. You hope that the crime scene is well preserved.</p>
