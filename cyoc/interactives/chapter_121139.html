<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben was still looking down at himself. He was almost naked,  weren&#39;t it that his shorts barely managed to cover his upgraded crotch. What he saw was the hind body of an enormous horse attached to his own human upper body. The program earlier mentioned something about added realism and that couldn&#39;t be unnoticed. A small line of hair/fur reached down from his belly button, brown instead of the black hairs Ben used to see, and the area of hair growth widened as it neared his pubic regions. The hair wasn&#39;t as curly as it used to be, it resembled the fur of a Clydesdale horse, one of the largest horse breeds in the world. <br />
<br />
No wonder Ben was so incredibly tall...<br />
<br />
Ben stroked the fur from his belly button to right above the beginning of his shorts. It felt rigid.<br />
<br />
Ben drew his hands past his shorts and continued the stroking from the strong equine thighs. He continued, and bent his knee -which still existed right on the spot it was supposed to be-, so he could reach to his foot, sorry, his hoof. It was really strange for Ben to have lost the sensation of having toes, but his mind didn&#39;t seem to miss it. His mind wasn&#39;t in a panicked state that made him *want* to wiggle his toes again. It just couldn&#39;t! He felt his hoof, it was rock hard.<br />
<br />
Ben bent his leg to bring himself into a seated, yoga-like position. He crossed his legs. Now he could take a moment to admire the &#39;sole&#39; of his foot. He got distracted though. The crossing of his horse legs made it uncomfortable to sit properly. First of all, he sat on his tail, secondly re-positioning himself caused a wedgie in his crotch.<br />
<br />
For the sake of convenience, Ben undid himself from his shorts, and got greeted by something... shocking.<br />
<br />
His dick, he&#39;d seen it so often before, but this was insane! It had increased in size. It was thicker and longer, but not only that. Something he didn&#39;t want to see was that his dick had turned pitch black, like that of a horse. It was a very alien sight. But Ben didn&#39;t care. His transformation had succeeded in a way that seemed better than turning into an actual centaur. He could now actually see everything important, the hooves, the legs, the tail... his dick. It was turning him on!<br />
<br />
His member thought differently apparently. It didn&#39;t react to his thoughts at all. It hung limp, laying on the sheet of his bed, as it could reach that far down now.<br />
<br />
Ben tried to make himself get aroused, as he started stroking his member. Feeling it was also a whole different story. It was like leather. Really thick, only not covered by the fur as it did to the rest of his equine lower body. He stood up again, finding support on his hooves. The area the hooves were covering on the floor was very small, so balancing was still hard. But, as long as he didn&#39;t try walking, he could still keep his back straight, and not fall down again.<br />
<br />
Once again, Ben touched himself. Holding his sheath, and playing with it, only gave him a very dull, an almost nonexistent pleasure. It was as if he was just rubbing skin. His new, longer dick, only got semi-hard, but if he didn&#39;t give it enough attention, it would just hang limp again. He stroked a more furiously after a while, but semi-hard was the best state he could bring his member in. Ben grabbed the ball sack behind his shaft. They were massive, must be filled with cum. Although his dick reacted to nothing, not even his own mind&#39;s arousal, he really wanted release. Every loin in his nether region told him so. An instinct, it seemed.<br />
<br />
Ben grabbed his phone, hoping to find a video that would do the trick. Just thinking about getting aroused didn&#39;t work, so he needed something else, some porn, a video he always came on. There it was! Lesbian porn, why not. As it started playing, he grabbed his big member again, and continued stroking.<br />
<br />
The stroking became more furious after a while, but for a different reason than Ben had hoped for. It was his own frustration. No video&#39;s he used to masturbate on helped. He had to think of something else. What would do the trick?<br />
<br />
Ben typed in &quot;mare&quot; on Google. He moved to the &quot;pictures&quot; list, and found himself looking at a bunch of horses. Scrolling down, slowly, he found out his eyes always got stuck on pictures in which he saw two horses in action, His dick started throbbing. Ben searched for videos showing the same thing. His mind found no sexual appeal at all, but his eyes were glued to the screen, while his arousal grew.<br />
<br />
When the video finally ended, details unnecessary, Ben found himself looking forward, right at his shaft. His shaft had gotten hard, the throbbing sensation of his dick was all too familiar, but the feeling had also increased to match the growth. He started to feel excited on how a climax would feel in that case.<br />
<br />
Ben could try it right now. He brought his right arm to his dick, while the other was feeling what was underneath. His balls were stiff, waiting for themselves to go into action, and Ben started thrusting. The leathery skin of his equine junk followed his lead, as he was thrusting much harder than would be healthy for a normal human penis. The pleasure was just as dull as before, but as he kept on thinking about that video and those pictures he showed himself, the feeling, as well as the need for release to come, increased exponentially.<br />
<br />
The pulsing in his foot long cock started getting stronger, but that was the only thing Ben actually felt changing. The pleasure stayed dull, until all of a sudden...<br />
<br />
His mind blew up! The sudden ecstasy caused him to lose his mind completely. Horse semen shot out in massive outbursts, not to be mistaken by the small spurts humans could only experience. His breathing stocked every time a new outburst appeared, with intervals of over a second so he could breathe some air at least.<br />
<br />
At least 15 seconds were wasted standing in the middle of his room, Ben&#39;s eyes rolled upwards, his hand still strongly gripping, until he finally came out of his ecstatic world of pleasure. He panted, looking at the mess on his floor. White specs were all over it. He was lucky it wasn&#39;t a carpet floor.</p>
