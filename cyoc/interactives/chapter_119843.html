<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill approached the apartment door carefully, silently listening to the commotion inside. <br />
<br />
“Cruu! Cruu! Cruuuuu!” Cried the humanoid half-bird creature in his confused state from inside. <br />
<br />
Bill smiled to himself, that serves the pervert right, now to confront the deviant himself and ensure to put an end to it. Turning the door he was surprised to find it opened, no need to pick the lock this time. The hall it led too was dark but a dimly lit light at the far end told him exactly where to go. <br />
<br />
Tomas had tried to maneuver himself towards his underwear shortly before the transformation took hold and unfortunately he was too late to cover his shame as he laid legs spread sprawled out on the floor in a panic. Bill watched from the shadows momentarily as he saw his newest creation helplessly laying there gyrating for him yet. Tomas&#39;s cock bounced and flaunted before him yet, causing a swell of frustration in Bill as he adjusted himself. Tomas&#39;s body was no longer the perky, smooth, and lean thing it used to be replaced by an almost comically frail and leathery skinned shell of it&#39;s former self. Tomas had easily lost a foot and a half in his height, and almost 40% or more of his body weight, and yet something about him remained entirely desirable. His bare thighs were muscular as they thrust and gyrate trying to lift his body weight, his pecs and abs still rock hard and firm, this was unusual for Bills creations.<br />
<br />
Bill suddenly took a step forward. &quot;Why do you told this?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tomas startled in such a panic he screeched like a wounded animal and nearly took flight before falling to the floor and scrambling. <br />
<br />
Bill continued &quot;You have no power over me pervert, you shall cease to try&quot; he commanded. <br />
<br />
Tomas could barely understand had this man heard him had he come to help. &quot;Cruu Cruu Cruuu&quot; is all he could say as he tried to beg Bill to help him, to get help. <br />
<br />
Bill stepped closer yet staring down at Tomas. &quot;you still continue to defy. You are a demon, a demon of lust&quot; Bill stared down between Tomas&#39;s thin scaled legs at his yet engorged cock. <br />
<br />
Tomas tried to beg but realized he was shamefully exposed yet he cringed at his own embarrassment and tried to cover himself but could not, he arms would not reach. He struggled to thrust his body towards his briefs on the floor but this only upset the intruder more. <br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot, I will not be tempted by you monster, others have gone before you and all have failed. You will join them now&quot; Bill said in an almost solemn tone as he nodded. He then brandished a small box and began tapping it. <br />
<br />
Tomas was scared now he didn&#39;t understand this man was going to help him wasn&#39;t he? Suddenly he felt queazy again his body seemed to ignite with wave of fire an itchiness across his skin as goose pimples began to spread throughout the remainder of his body and small needles began to push out from them. He realized he was getting worse &quot;CRUU CRUUUU!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill smirked &quot;This will serve you right pervert, you won&#39;t tempt me or anyone with your ways again.&quot; Bill looked proudly at the former man before him panicked as he received divine justice. He&#39;d seen so many like this before and it delighted him to know that he was helping to cleanse them of their sins. It was a miracle that he&#39;d been granted this power at all, but fate had done just that. He&#39;d convinced himself he&#39;d been sent it by divine intervention, it had come to his address though it was marked for the previous tenant whom would later come to retrieve it and meet the same fate as all the others.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know how to operate the machine very well, it had come with no instructions as it was for all he could tell one of a kind, developed by an employee at some lab and discarded upon the labs closure due to funding cuts. From there it went to auction and was lost in the mail until fate would lead it to his door. He&#39;d only managed to get a very basic understanding of its power but powerful it was. The first time he&#39;d used it on it&#39;s intended owner was a terrifying and thrilling revelation. <br />
<br />
He recalled watching the 6&#39;4 man disappear into his suit like some deflating balloon. The howling and cries of panic and confusion as the suit folded down around him. He thought he&#39;d killed someone, a sin he thought he&#39;d never commit, but was shocked when he pulled the suit jacket away to reveal standing in the pants and boxers was a minuscule hairless pigeon-like creature in place of the man. He recalled it looking up at him pathetically naked and afraid, pleadingly as it let out its first cry. <br />
<br />
Tomas struggled as Bill knelt between his legs and grimaced in a strange disgust. &quot;The bird does not get a worm&quot; said the man as he covered Tomas&#39;s cock with his own hands. It felt amazing to be touched, Tomas startled and thrust but Bill pressed down harder closing his eyes. He could feel himself getting hot, changing even further.</p>
