<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was freaking out! How was he looking down at his own body? Foam leaking out of his mouth, his eyes rolled back into his head. He recoiled backwards, running into some student’s and desks before he fell on his butt. School staff was rushing into the classroom now, attempting to remove the students from the room and revive his seemingly lifeless body. Ms. Smith from across the hall approached Ryan, still sitting on the floor, “Jake, are you alright, honey?” she asked with a thinly masked panic in her voice, “look at me honey, not at Mr. Morris, come on lets get out of here.” <br />
<br />
Ryan was trying to get out an explanation of what had happened, but couldn’t form the words. “The blue juice” he stammered, “my body, why did it happen?” Ms. Smith rushed him down the hallway into the cafeteria with the rest of the students. “I’m Ryan Morris” he finally said with enough force to get her attention. Ms. Smith looked down at him with concern and sympathy. “Ohh dear,” she said, “you have been badly shaken. Sit down here and we’ll call your parents.” Ms. Smith sat Ryan down at a table by himself, “sit here and relax, honey” she ordered. <br />
<br />
As soon as Ms. Smith left Ryan got up and went to the bathroom. He felt like he was going to puke. He made it to the sink and threw up. When he pulled his head up from the sink and looked in the mirror he saw the smug face of Kurt, one of the slower kids in his class looking back.  Jake was tall for his age at about 5’8” feet tall with blond hair, greenish eyes, and an untoned muscular frame. He was strong but still seemed to be carrying a lot of baby fat. Jake was just barely passing his classes, learning new things didn’t come easy to him, but his size kept most of the teasing at bay. The other students were afraid if they pushed it too far, they might get beat up.  Ryan was at a loss for an explanation. He had to get back to the liquor store and find out what was in that flask. <br />
<br />
Ryan slipped out the restroom and the cafeteria taking up a quick jog towards the strip mall.  Kurt was in better shape than Ryan’s old body but the jog wasn’t an easy one for him.  After about 35 minutes of jogging an exhausted Kurt arrived at the liquor store.  Huffing and puffing he made his way back to the cashier.  The clerk smiled. “So you drank it?” he said amused, “and you survived.” Ryan was taken aback. “You, you?” he stuttered. “Yes I know its you” the clerk said, “you regretted you mistakes you wanted a fresh start, so I gave you one.” Ryan was speechless. “Your essence is now detached from your physical form” the clerk continued, “it will take some practice but you will be able to switch forms at will. Just make sure you’re not out of a body for too long or you will fade away.” Ryan was still speechless, when a police officer entered the store. The clerk waived him over, “I believe this boy is lost.” The Police officer had just received a report about a student missing from the school and collected Ryan and returned him to the Junior High.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ryan got a polite talking too about leaving the school and going to a liquor store, but it was chalked up to the extraordinary circumstances of the day.  The school tried to get ahold of Kurt’s mother to pick him up, but she couldn’t leave the restaurant she worked at and told them just to let him take the bus or walk home.  The secretary who made the call found this totally unacceptable and after looking up Kurt’s address drove him home herself.  They pulled up to a run down apartment building and the secretary said wished him well. Ryan was still in shock trying to decipher the old clerks words.  He was an educated man, and he knew what he had seen was true, but he just couldn’t bring himself to believe it.  Ryan got out of the car and walked slowly towards the building.  He had no idea what unit Kurt lived in, but the complex wasn’t overly big, only about 12 units.  Kurt had keys in his pocket and after a few tries, he found a key that worked on a door.  <br />
<br />
Ryan walked in and found a disgusting little apartment.  The furniture was mismatched, well worn, and stained.  The place reeked of cigarette smoke, there was a bong out on what could generously be called the coffee table. Off the livingroom/kitchen there was a bathroom and two tiny bedrooms.  One clearly belong to woman, probably Kurt’s mother, with bras and make up strewn about the room.  From the kitchen a phone rang, Ryan was hesitant to pick it up, the ringing continued until finally, Ryan grabbed it.  “Hello” he stuttered out. “Kurt, what the hell took you so long?” an exasperated woman on the other line spat, “I’m just making sure you’re all ok. I’m sorry I couldn’t get you but you know I’m on thin ice at the diner.” There was a pause and Ryan struggled to find the words to fill it, “I’m ok, I don’t understand what happened.”  Kurt’s mother sighed, “The school says he had some kind of fit and now he’s in a coma.” Ryan didn’t know what to say so he remained silent. “Don’t worry babe” she continued “I’m sure whatever the perv has gotten himself isn’t contagious. But I’ve got to go, get yourself cleaned up and there’s a box of macaroni and cheese in the cabinet for dinner. Leave me some.” The phone hung up.  <br />
<br />
Ryan didn’t know if what she said was true, about his body being in a coma, but she didn’t have any reason to lie.  Unless she was sparing her son some concern about his teacher dying.  Ryan thought about it for a few minutes, before giving it up, the only way he’d know for sure is by finding out where his body was and going to see it himself.  In the mean time he detected the usual smell that emanated form Kurt.  The gym teacher had bought Kurt deodorant several times in an attempt to make him a little less ripe as the day went on, but Kurt always seemed to forget it.  Ryan went to Kurt’s room to find some clean clothes, but to no avail.  Kurt’s room consisted of a twin matress on the floor with piles of clothes on the floor spilling out of a closet that had no hangers.  None of the clothes smelt like they were clean.  Ryan was in charge of the laundry at his home so he grabbed an armful of colored clothing and walked across the hallway to the small inlet he’d noticed contained a washer and dryer.  Ryan started a load in the washer and then headed over to the bathroom to take a shower.  <br />
<br />
Ryan stripped down examining Kurt’s body in the mirror. Kurt had broad shoulders and a thick waste, if he worked out and filled out a little he’d have a killer body. Ryan’s old body was about the same size as Kurt’s only 20 years older. Ryan paused but then continued and pulled down Kurt’s shorts and underwear. He didn’t want to be a pervert, like they all said he was, but this was his body for now. Kurt had truly been blessed. Ryan’s old one topped at 3” hard and depending on how cold it was out stood at between 1 and 3” soft. He didn’t grow but he wasn’t showing much. Kurt was closer to 6” soft and stiffened up to a little better than 8” without very much encouragement.  This was the biggest penis Ryan had ever seen and it was on a 14 year old.  <br />
<br />
Ryan got in the shower and stood there letting the water wash over him. The store clerk wasn’t wrong. He had spent so much of his time lately counting up all the mistakes he’d made over the years, and now he had a fresh start. Furthermore, if what the man said was right, he could have as many fresh starts as he wanted. Ryan didn’t have any family to speak of, he was an only child and his parents had passed. He had some cousins that he wasn’t close to at all. What really was he holding onto his old life for? Ryan reached down and started playing with his new cock. It already had a pretty thick mane of pubes around it. Kurt was a lucky boy, Ryan might enjoy being Kurt.</p>
