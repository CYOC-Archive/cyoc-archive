<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeremy was feeling weird. As June closed her eyes, he felt how his liquid body was filling June&#39;s. &quot;What is going to happen? Ty, please help me!&quot; he thought, but after hearing his own words on his liquid mind he felt like if he fainted.<br />
<br />
Ty decided to leave. He noticed that June was really tired, so he decided to leave her alone a bit. He was still excited about what was going to happen with Jeremy, but he could wait an hour or two before that. He went downstairs and to the kitchen where Dustin was helping his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dustin.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi big bro!&quot; the young Dustin said smiling.<br />
<br />
Just like June, Ty also noticed that Dustin was acting differently. Dustin was now very polite, a totally new boy. June didn&#39;t remember that he was a 16 years old rude boy some days ago. Only Ty and Dustin knew the truth. Ty was starting to feel bad so he decided to restore his brother&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin... I was thinking...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; the little boy said as he prepared the salad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to turn you into a 16 years old again. I wanted to punish you, but now as I watch you as a kid I feel very sorry, you don&#39;t deserve this.&quot; Ty said while scratching his new bigger biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. Let me stay as a kid, I&#39;m very fine like this.&quot; he said happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you turned me into a kid I started a new life. It was hard at first, but now it&#39;s better than my old life. I learnt a lot of things like how to treat your brother and family, now I have new friends and I enjoy watching cartoons again. That&#39;s so cool!&quot; Dustin raised his arms. &quot;And also I got a big brother. And he&#39;s the most muscular boy in the school! Bullies will never attack me!&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Ty blush and smile at the same time. They talked for some minutes and decided to stay that way, both liked their new bodies. Finally, Ty hugged his new little brother(he didn&#39;t remember the last time he did that).<br />
Ty snapped his fingers and all his clothes quickly turned into a dark blue wrestling suit and boots. His new suit was tight, but fit him perfectly and showed off all his muscles. His new bulging pecs were sticking out like two small boulders in his chest. He flexed his arms, and his biceps quickly grew into almost a bowling ball size.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think? Do you like it?&quot; Ty said as he did more poses like a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! You are awesome, bro!&quot; Dustin cheered. Finally, they were real brothers.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
Jeremy could open his eyes finally. He felt weird and dizzy, but finally he was feeling again like a human.<br />
He opened his eyes. All he could see was the ceiling of a room, but it was not his room. He looked around and noticed that he was on a double bed. He got up slowly because he was still feeling a bit sick.<br />
He put his hand on his head, the only thing he remembered was June drinking him. Suddenly he noticed that he was wearing weird clothes, and later saw that his arms were skinnier but longer. Something was wrong. He stood up and quickly ran to a mirror that was near the bed. He saw his reflection on the mirror... and he didn&#39;t like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be...&quot; he said as he noticed his voice also changed. And then, he screamed like a woman, loudly and scared.<br />
<br />
Dustin and Ty heard the voice of their mother and quickly ran upstairs. Ty forgot completely about Jeremy, what happened then?<br />
They opened their parents&#39; bedroom door and saw their mother scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty... Ty...! It&#39;s me! Jeremy!&quot; Jeremy said when he saw Ty and Dustin entering the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Ty smiled. &quot;That&#39;s so cool! This is very exciting, my best friend is now my mother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not funny Ty! Please fix it!&quot; Jeremy said worried but Ty seemed to ignore him/her, he was already wondering how life can be if your mother is your best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... Excuse me. Can anyone explain me what&#39;s happening here?&quot; Dustin wondered. Ty returned to the real world and tried to calm down Jeremy, who was now in June&#39;s body. Then, he explained everything to Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are our neighbor Jeremy? Cool!&quot; Dustin seemed to enjoy that too. &quot;I&#39;m Dustin, but Ty made me younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I know... But that doesn&#39;t matter now. How can you be so happy when I&#39;m now a woman!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, Jeremy. I know you feel weird now, but you will get used to it soon. You should stay like June for some time, it can be very funny.&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know why you can say that. How am I supposed to act like your mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are still our beloved Jeremy, but you also have June&#39;s body. You will know how to act like a woman, don&#39;t worry about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the soccer team? And my parents?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Ty snapped his fingers again. &quot;I already fixed that, don&#39;t worry and enjoy being our mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty...&quot; she gulped. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I want to be your mother... I mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dude! You will do a great job, I know!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, forget about your old life for now and try to live as our mother.&quot; Dustin also tried to help, but Jeremy wasn&#39;t sure yet. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see what happens from now on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I repeat. Don&#39;t worry friend, this is only temporary and we are the only that know what happened here, everyone will still recognize you as June. We will still call you Jeremy if we are alone. What do you think?&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I have no choice. You are the only one who can change this, but it seems that I can&#39;t convince you... I&#39;ll try it, but it&#39;s so hard to be a woman.&quot; Jeremy said touching her long hair.<br />
<br />
June was a beautiful 43 years old woman. She looked much younger, like a 30 years old woman, and she had a perfect body for her age. And now Jeremy, who was a normal 14 years old boy, was in June&#39;s body. It was hard to act like a normal woman for him, but it was also a new experience.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty... I should be very proud of you, right?&quot; she asked her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Ty wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude... Look at you wearing that wrestling singlet! You are not very tall, but you are huge anyway! You must be one of the most muscular boys of your age in the world!&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Well... Me...&quot; Ty said blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and you are my son! So I guess that makes me a mother proud of her son, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin and Ty laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dudes... Don&#39;t laugh. I still have to get used to this.&quot; Jeremy said and joined them laughing.</p>
