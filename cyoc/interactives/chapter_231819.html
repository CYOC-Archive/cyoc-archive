<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The twenty-something couldn&#39;t believe the mess he had gotten himself into. He wasn&#39;t about to ask any of his straight friends to wear him and even if he signed up to one of those gay apps to find an anonymous samaritan willing to fulfill the conditions that didn&#39;t change the fact that he&#39;d have to let his mouth and anus get ravaged... five times!<br />
<br />
The most sensible thing to do was to go back to that strange store and ask for a refund. Surely the shopkeeper would give John his money back, get that goddamned zipper off him and offer him an apology for having such a dangerous gag gift for sale.<br />
<br />
John checked himself in the mirror one last time before leaving. Thankfully the zipper wasn&#39;t visible now that he was dressed as it was safely hidden in his privates. John checked his side profile and, apart from his belly being neatly folded into a slimmer figure and his bulge and derriere looking less bulky, he didn&#39;t look that different at all.<br />
<br />
He would do it, what was the worst that could happen?<br />
<br />
And thus John left the safe confines of his home and headed back in the direction of the store. It was just twenty minutes away by foot, nothing too grand. He walked for five minutes and was starting to forget all about the zipper when he saw Marco leaving the gym. The muscular and tanned man was a good friend of John&#39;s, if only a bit over enthusiastic about keeping himself in shape at all times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, how&#39;s it going?&quot; Marco asked. He looked clean and fresh, he probably had just taken a shower in the gym&#39;s locker room before leaving. John was sure a big and well-built man like Marco got lots of curious looks when he got naked in public and the smaller man wondered how he could stand all that attention on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much. Going to the store to refund something.&quot; John replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool. I may go to a store to refund some things one of these days, too.&quot; Marco answered back.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t a lot that John and Marco had in common, so their conversations tended to be quite shallow.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Yeah, I&#39;d better get going. See ya.&quot; John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Always a pleasure to see ya, John.&quot; Marco gave John a firm handshake as a farewell gesture and that was that before the big man continued on his way.<br />
<br />
Shit, Marco sure was strong. For a split moment John thought his right hand was about to get completely crushed. John looked down at his hand and his mouth went agape when he realized that in fact his hand had been literally flattened into a 2D cutout of itself thanks to Marco&#39;s eager handshake.<br />
<br />
John then remembered that the zipper had basically turned him into a skinsuit full of air, he was not unlike a balloon, but where had the air in his hand gone to?<br />
<br />
As John was looking at his flattened hand with confusion he began to feel a soft breeze on his buttocks. He looked behind him and saw that his ass had been expanded to such a gargantuan size that his pants and underwear had a big rip on them.<br />
<br />
Now, this was embarrassing. Luckily Marco hadn&#39;t turned back, because then he would have seen John&#39;s extremely large pale buttocks exposed to the elements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap, crap, crap!&quot; John said under his breath. He placed his hands on his buttocks and pushed them in until they were flat again. However, the air didn&#39;t go back to his right hand, but to his torso.<br />
<br />
John surely was having trouble keeping himself in shape, in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
His shirt was ripped away by the giant bulges that his man boobs and belly so generously provided. Oh shit, he looked morbidly obese as if he had eaten a whole buffet and more.<br />
<br />
Before anyone could see, John pushed his belly and newly-born moobs into his torso until it looked perfectly flat again.<br />
<br />
This didn&#39;t last even two seconds.<br />
<br />
All the air he had pushed in ended up enlarging his penis into a 16-feet-long pink python. It looked surreal. John had never felt an erection quite like this but it was just air after all, so picking up the tip and rolling this fleshy hose all up into a more manageable state was far easier than it looked.<br />
<br />
All these sudden outbursts of body mass expanding had rendered John&#39;s clothes completely useless. The only thing that didn&#39;t fall to the floor in shreds were his shoes and socks and knowing his luck once he were to push his penis back his feet were going to be the next thing to grow into clothes-ripping monstrosities.<br />
<br />
John&#39;s line of thought was interrupted by a sudden noise he heard. The color drained from his face. He looked at his surroundings, afraid of being caught naked holding this fire hose. But when he realized the only spectator staring at him was a stray cat that had come out from hiding under a car he couldn&#39;t help bursting out in laughter at the absurdity of his situation.<br />
<br />
There he was, practically naked, unable to rearrange back his body to normalcy, holding his rolled up 16-feet-long penis like a freaking cable. And he wasn&#39;t even half the way to the store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoo, go away, you don&#39;t want to mess with this.&quot; He shooed the cat away pointing at his shaft and as he held it, his peehole slit staring back at the animal&#39;s slitted eyes threatingly, the cat hid under the cars again.<br />
<br />
That had been a close call, but John couldn&#39;t parade naked like this if he didn&#39;t want to be branded a pervert. He grabbed the tip of his elongated penis, stretched his shaft around his waist and tied it all up with a secure knot. His manhood was now easier to carry around, looking like a makeshift flesh-colored belt on him. He then sat down behind one of the parked cars to hide his shameful form as he thought long and hard about his next course of action.<br />
<br />
His clothes were all rags on the floor by now. There was no way they&#39;d fit him like this but maybe he could repurpose them in some way... Wait, maybe he could try the other way around, with his malleable body he could repurpose himself into something that didn&#39;t seem that out of place. He only needed to conceal himself until he arrived at the store, after all. He was basically a sentient balloon made of flesh. John remembered about that time he learned to make balloon animals for his nephew&#39;s birthday party...<br />
<br />
The naked twenty-something clad in nothing but in shoes and a belt made out of his own cock sat hidden behind a parked car, his bare buttocks sitting on the asphalt. And under the car there was the black cat from before staring intently at something shiny dangling from behind the man&#39;s balls... It was a zipper... It looked fun enough to give it a playful tug with his paw...</p>
