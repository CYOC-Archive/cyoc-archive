<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pair that was in the dressing room next door to the one Katie and Kellie were in did have quite a lot reason to argue. Unknown to Katie, it was a girl she used to babysit, Cindy, as well as her stepmother, Trudy. Trudy and Cindy didn&#39;t get along for several of the reasons that mirror the classic &#39;wicked stepmother&#39; story. Trudy was known to be a gold-digger and she spent quite a lot of time making herself look pretty. Admittedly, she didn&#39;t require a lot to do that, her 38-year old body was withstanding the test of time pretty well, even she was starting to sag in a few places. But it was obvious that she only married Cindy&#39;s widower father for his money and there was no love lost between her and Cindy.<br />
<br />
Not that Cindy was an angel herself. As Katie could attest to, her father did a very poor job in disciplining her and teaching her manners. As such, Cindy was what many people would call a spoiled brat. She was known for throwing a tantrum if something wasn&#39;t just right and she got awfully specific with the details of thing she wanted. Those who knew this family well enough were uncertain if Trudy was justly punished with Cindy or vice versa. In short, practically the only time they weren&#39;t arguing was when Cindy&#39;s father was there.<br />
<br />
The argument they were having right now was a good example. &quot;You can&#39;t tell me what I can&#39;t wear!&quot; snapped Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, my house, my rules,&quot; said Trudy authoritatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s my house, you just managed to get into it!&quot; snapped Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still your mother, young lady, and you&#39;re not wearing something that expensive at the beach,&quot; said Trudy.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>My</i> swimsuit&#39;s expensive?&quot; snapped Cindy, &quot;Yours is over $100!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s my money and I look better in it than you ever will,&quot; said Trudy mockingly, jiggling her breasts to taunt Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your money, it&#39;s my dad&#39;s money!&quot; snapped Cindy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same thing,&quot; said Trudy dismissively.<br />
<br />
Cindy was winding up for another meltdown when both of them felt an odd tingle go through them. At the same time, all the anger they felt towards each other just drained out. The two just stared blankly, forgetting what they were arguing about earlier. Eventually, Cindy looked up at Trudy, suddenly noticing her beauty for the first time. &quot;That bikini does look nice on you,&quot; she said, saying probably the first nice thing she ever said to her stepmother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thank you,&quot; said Trudy, inexplicably blushing. She was aware her stepdaughter was showing signs of becoming a lovely young lady, but for some reason, those signs were more obvious than before. She was also feeling more energetic than she remember feeling in a long time. &quot;I did put a lot of work into keeping this body in shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy&#39;s eyes were locked on Trudy&#39;s body. Specifically, her top which wasn&#39;t fitting her breasts as well as they had previously. They were growing more perky than the top was currently adjusted to. She didn&#39;t even notice how the distance between her eyes and her stepmother&#39;s breasts was shrinking as she started growing taller, her own pubescent mounds starting to become more pronounced. &quot;You mind if I...have a closer look?&quot; asked Cindy, her voice starting to sound a little different.<br />
<br />
Trudy might have been shocked by the request, but she actually felt more turned on by it. &quot;Sure,&quot; she said, a bit bashfully. She reached up and untied the strings of her bikini top, letting it fall open and reveal her not-so-saggy breasts. The tanned skin of her body was becoming tighter as wrinkles faded and her dark hair had a more youthful sheen now. &quot;Like what you see?&quot; she asked, squeezing her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah...&quot; said Cindy in a dazed voice. She reached up and gently grasped Trudy&#39;s tits. Trudy gasped, but didn&#39;t push Cindy away. Cindy couldn&#39;t deny what she was feeling any longer. Her head was already at the right height so she leaned forward and latched her mouth over one nipple. Trudy groaned as Cindy suckled, neither of them noticing how Cindy was maturing. Her hips and ass were becoming rounder as her legs became longer and curvier. As her ash-blonde hair grew longer, the face it framed became more mature and beautiful. Her own breasts were starting to round out as they grew larger.<br />
<br />
Trudy moaned, weaving her hands through Cindy&#39;s hair. Eventually, they found their way down to Cindy&#39;s top. They quickly undid the strings before trusting themselves in and grasping Cindy&#39;s breasts. That caused Cindy to throw her head back and moan as Trudy kneaded her boobs. When Cindy opened her eyes, Trudy&#39;s face was inches from hers. A few seconds later, they mashed lips, moaning into each other&#39;s mouths. Their bare breasts rubbed against each other as they made out. The spots between their legs were getting moist as they got more turned on.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Trudy broke away and said, &quot;We better cool it before we make a mess in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy smiled and said, &quot;Right. We don&#39;t want my brother to pay for all that.&quot; Their relationship was no longer stepmother and stepdaughter. Now they were a pair of lesbian lovers who shamelessly mooch off of Cindy&#39;s older brother, who was formerly her father. But that didn&#39;t mean the two were untalented. The two 25-year old women did have the bodies to be models, but they had yet to be discovered by any big agencies. But it was only a matter of time before their ship came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s try these babies out on the beach,&quot; said Trudy, putting her top back on and readjusting for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to taking it off you later,&quot; purred Cindy as she got her own top on, her swimsuit having adjusted to her new body.<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie watched from behind the door of their changing room as the new couple left theirs. It was hard to believe that the stepmother and stepdaughter who hated each other&#39;s guts now could barely keep their hands off each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you wish for them to &#39;shut up and make out&#39;, that ring really granted it,&quot; said Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll need to be more careful of what I say,&quot; said Katie, &quot;Should I change them back now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They seem better this way,&quot; observed Kellie, &quot;They&#39;re certainly less of a pain to others now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or I could switch their roles and make Trudy the stepdaughter and Cindy the stepmother,&quot; said Katie thoughtfully. She wondered what she could do.</p>
