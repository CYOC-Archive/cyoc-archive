<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty tossed and turned in his bed. The sheer possibilities at his fingertips wouldn&#39;t let him sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then,&quot; he muttered, getting up. &quot;I wish I was fully awake as if I had gotten a full night&#39;s sleep.&quot; His eyes widened, as the slowly building darkness beneath his eyes faded. &quot;I wish that no one would get woken up by my activities, no matter how disruptive I&#39;m being.&quot; his fingers tingled, and he looked around. &quot;I wish I could see as though I was under an open noon sky.&quot; His room lit up, the shadows falling just beside what cast them. He nodded to himself and left his room. <br />
<br />
He entered Dustin&#39;s room, heading straight for his bed. His now little brother slept calmly under the covers. Those covers were thrown off, and Ty started wishing. &quot;I wish Dustin was a girl.&quot; His, now her body shifted. The slightest curves appeared on her body, and her hair filled out. &quot;I wish she had the body of a 16-year-old professional swimmer.&quot; Her body grew, the shirt and pants tightening. Her taut stomach was revealed, as were most of her calves. Her hair was cut by some unseen force, the waste hair disappearing into puffs of smoke. The remaining hair lightened up as if she had been regularly bleaching it. <br />
<br />
Her room changed as well. The football trophies all transformed into swimming ones. Pictures appeared on the walls, featuring her and her friends... as well as a few pictures of Ty. He ignored that and changed her further. &quot;I wish that she was a swan-harpy.&quot; Her shirtsleeves disappeared, as her arms turned into wings. She turned over, curling up into a little ball- as her feet shifted into webbed swan feet. Her breasts firmed up significantly, finally shredding her shirt- and revealing her heavily muscled back. &quot;I wish she loved me,&quot; he added. Her phone buzzed, causing Ty to pick it up. *Celebrate Ty&#39;s 15th birthday!* the alert said, *Ending in 2 hours* The screensaver was a picture of the two of them at the beach, holding up a crab she had just found.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled and left Dusty&#39;s room- now confident that she wouldn&#39;t hate him anymore. Instead, he entered June and Mark&#39;s room. The two of them were on the extreme other side of the bed, facing away from each other. First thing&#39;s first: mess with Mark. &quot;I wish Mark was a girl, and that June and she were lesbians.&quot; Immediately, the entire room shifted. Mark&#39;s features softened, and her hair had grown. On the nightstand, a pill bottle appeared. *May Arlech* it read *Estrogen*. &quot;huh,&quot; Ty said under his breath. &quot;Makes sense...&quot;<br />
<br />
If May had always been a woman, Dusty wouldn&#39;t exist. Unless there was a man in the relationship... actually, there just needs a cock n balls in the equation. &quot;I wish that June was a futanari- someone with fully functional male and female reproductive organs.&quot; The room shifted more, and so did their positions. May looked even softer, as June was wrapped around her. &quot;I wish that June, May, and Dusty were all supermodel-level beautiful,&quot; Ty added, before continuing, &quot;I wish that May was a small, lithe Dragon girl, with a long, slim tail, and slim horns. I wish that June was an Oni, with huge, sculpted muscles.&quot; The two shifted more, with May snuggling up to the much bigger June. June muttered something in her sleep, her hand trailing along May&#39;s back lovingly.<br />
<br />
Ty muttered, &quot;I wish they loved me as much as they love Dusty.&quot;<br />
<br />
His room shifted, ending when he entered. His entire room looked... lived in now. His closet was now much larger, as was his bed. There was a mirror in the corner, and a few feathers were scattered here and there. His computer was now a full-on battle station. He resisted the urge to check out his computer and stood in front of the mirror. He took a deep breath, and said, &quot;I wish I was an eighteen-year-old lamia girl futa.&quot;<br />
<br />
His body shifted, as he felt a lurch. He stumbled back but didn&#39;t fall, as his new tail caught him. His hips shot out extremely wide, and his ass bubbled as it grew wider. He turned to she when a slit grew beneath his scrotum. Said scrotum expanded, becoming golf ball-sized at least. Any hair on her crotch disappeared, as her penis expanded even larger. <br />
<br />
Her slight tummy disappeared, as memories of learning to dance filled her mind. Her skin darkened slightly too, gaining a healthy tan. Her chest bubbled up, straining her shirt. Her hands shrunk, becoming dainty and delicate. Her hair grew out behind her. She changed the colour, her voice cracking mid-word. Her new voice was deep, husky, and smooth. Her face changed last, becoming more mature and feminine. &quot;La... la... la...&quot; she said, examining herself. &quot;I wish my name was Skyla... I wish... hmm, I wish my tail was black, green, and brown.&quot;<br />
<br />
The scales on her tail shifted, losing the red and yellow colouring. Instead, her tail became striped with deep black, forest green, and mud brown lines. She clucked her tongue, as she cocked her hip out to the side. &quot;Mhmmmm I like thissss,&quot; she said, purposefully letting her &#39;sss&#39; linger. &quot;I think that... I can lasssst until sssunday.&quot;<br />
<br />
She slithered back onto the bed, intending on skipping to tomorrow... before she heard a knock on her door. &quot;Come in,&quot; she said, sitting up</p>
