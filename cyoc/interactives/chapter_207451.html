<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The skunk sufficiently dealt with, Troy tossed the Book of Beasts on his bed. His stomach growled, and the rottweiler placed a paw on his chubby stomach. Guess he hadn’t eaten much of anything lately except skunk ass. He went to the bathroom, splashed some water on his face, then went into the kitchen to scrounge up something to eat.<br />
<br />
Opening up the fridge, Troy was really digging a bowl of cereal for breakfa… for lunch. Didn’t matter, he still wanted cereal, but as when he picked up the milk carton he noticed that it felt suspiciously light. He gave it a quick shake, then opened it to confirm that, in fact, someone had drank all the milk and just put the empty cartoon back in the fridge.<br />
<br />
RK must have seen Troy playing around with the milk carton because he said, “Rusty used the last of the milk on his cereal before he went to work, you’ll have to go out back and make some more.”<br />
<br />
Fucking Rusty drinking all his milk! Of course he put the empty carton back, too. Dick.<br />
<br />
As he wondered whether he wanted cereal enough to go buy milk, he spied the Book of Divination on the kitchen table. Curious, Troy walked over and picked it up. He flipped a few pages. Hmmm…Commune might be interesting. The ability to answer one question.<br />
<br />
“Commune.” He muttered. “Where can I go to get milk?”<br />
<br />
The thought came to him as though he were struck by sudden inspiration. Clint! Of course! All he needed to do was to go ask his neighbor if he could borrow some. Clint’s a nice guy, he’d help Troy out. He was usually out in the backyard on sunny days, grazing. Dude was really into the whole ‘living naturally’ lifestyle that was a big trend for anthros nowadays.<br />
<br />
Troy turned and looked towards their backyard. Had their house gotten smaller? He vaguely remembered their house having a slight L shape to it, with a few rooms being positioned to the right of their porch but looking out through the back window there was nothing next to their porch except for a fence that surrounded Clint’s farm.<br />
<br />
Of course there wasn’t anything next to the porch, that’s where Clint’s cow pasture was!<br />
<br />
Troy frowned. Something about all of that didn’t sound right to him. Didn’t they just have a barbecue? Why would there be a pasture in the middle of town? Just in case, he grabbed the Book of Divination and tucked it under his arm. No nosebleeds.<br />
<br />
He sighed in relief. Maybe he just needed to stop smoking pot. It was really fucking with his memory.<br />
<br />
As Troy walked over to the backdoor he noticed that his pants had started to become tight. That was weird, Troy remembered them being loose enough when he stuck the Boost of Beasts under them. Unbuttoning his pants, he felt his cock press firmly against the front of his pants, slowly unzipping the fly as the pressure grew, sensitive and leaking. Damn.<br />
<br />
He looked down to see what the trouble was and laughed.<br />
<br />
Of course his pants were too tight! He’d somehow put on Rusty’s pants. He couldn’t believe he’d make that mistake. Troy chuckled and shook his head. Bovines like him needed pants that were loose in the waist. Fuck. He must be high to have picked those out.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Troy began to step out into the backyard, but as soon as he walked outside, he felt a sudden gurgle in his belly, followed by a slight cramping in his stomach. Troy gasped and panted, hoping he hadn’t gotten a stomach bug after his escapades last night. As the gurgles subsided, he awkwardly  hopped over the fence and set out across the pasture to Clint’s farmhouse. Another bout of indigestion struck him, twisting his guts. The further he walked, the more intense the cramping grew.<br />
<br />
<i>Man what did I eat last night?</I> Troy thought as he rubbed his hands over the white and black splotched fur on his stomach, an image of RK’s ass popping into his mind, <I>… other than that.</I><br />
<br />
He felt oddly bloated, his flesh puffier, especially in the front of his pants. Troy panted and gasped, trying to cool off. His fur was damp with sweat, though instead of wet dog, he was beginning to smell like a barn. Troy waved a paw in front of his face in an effort to cool himself off, not noticing his nails blunting and widening into hooflets.<br />
<br />
The field was uneven, full of luscious grass that had his mouth watering, for some reason. Up ahead, he could see the big red barn and Clint’s white farmhouse. However, it was like he was growing heavier and heavier. His pants were fully unzipped now and his gut flopped painfully in front of him, pink and sensitive.<br />
<br />
Troy staggered as the pink bag inflated even more. His pants had disappeared, but the heavy weight was slowing him down. He gasped and wheezed as the bag grew more and more, sloshing, veins pulsing on it. He fell to his knees, exhausted, the barn in sight.<br />
<br />
This was all wrong. Why couldn’t he move.? The bag continued to grow, and four little nubs grew on its surface. The quickly extended, like fingers, and Troy realized what he was holding: An udder. A very big, very full, udder.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Troy’s eyes widened as he realized what was happening. “Reality Audit? Because I made RK Rusty’s boyfriend?  Are you serious, Loki?!”<br />
<br />
He thought he heard a chuckle on the wind.<br />
<br />
“Laugh it up asshole, ya fucked me.” Troy growled and rolled his eyes. “Look, I’ll go back and become his boyfriend and eat his ass out all day. Just stop this. I know you can if you wanted to.”<br />
<br />
The world went oddly silent, as though the Auditor were considering his offer.<br />
<br />
“Please, man? I’m still high, but I don’t wanna be a cow.” Troy pleaded, milk sloshing in his udder. “I make things interesting, don’t I? What if the next owner is a boring prude?”<br />
<br />
The silence stretched, just like Troy’s ears as the grew longer and less floppy. His ears twitched as a fly landed on them involuntarily. How the fuck was he going to save himself from an Audit?<br />
<br />
The Book! Troy pulled open the Book of Divination and quickly flipped through the pages, hoping to find the right spell. The whole time, his body was growing larger and larger. There had to be something here that could save him. No way would anyone get a Book that couldn’t save them from an Audit.<br />
<br />
He found a spell that would show him the most likely futures. Maybe one of them would give him a way to reason with the Auditor. Or, Troy didn’t know, maybe if he just rolled sideways RK would find him and save him with the Book of Beasts or something.<br />
<br />
“Futuresight!” Troy shouted.<br />
<br />
As soon as Troy spoke the word, the world around him seemed to flicked away. What replaced it was a endless expanse of possibilities, all briefly shimmering into existence, only to be replaced moments later by another world - by another one Troy&#39;s futures. And to Troy&#39;s stark terror, every single one of them was the same. No matter how many realities popped into existence before him, every single one of them showed the same, fat cow standing dumbly in the middle of a field. A full udder dangled below her, veins pressing out into its skin by the pressure of the milk inside - all while the cow stared longingly at the anthro horse that was slowly making his milking rounds.<br />
<br />
Sure, there were some small differences. Sometimes the cow was facing north, sometimes south. Sometimes Clint got to her sooner, sometimes later. Sometimes she was chewing cud, other times she was grazing. But Troy didn&#39;t have to be able to read his future mind to know that what little was left of it in these possibilities wanted nothing more than to have Clint wrap his fingers around her teats give a gentle tug, letting the milk flow out and relieving her of the pressure dangling between her legs.<br />
<br />
Reality kept flashing by, but there was no escape. The moment Troy had walked out of the house, a line had been crossed past which there were only pastures and milkings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please man... please... I&#39;m begging you. Don&#39;t turn me into a dairy cow! Anything but that. Clint&#39;s supposed to be my neighbor, not my milker.&quot; Troy cried out, hoping that the auditor could still hear him in this passage between worlds.<br />
<br />
Troy blinked as the chuckle from before turned into a cackle. <br />
<br />
In the heartbeat that it took Troy to open his eyes, reality had shifted again. Standing in the field was the same cow but now there was a calf standing alongside her, its head tucked between her legs as it nursed from her udder. But most concerning to Troy was the look on the cow&#39;s face. In place of the dumb, glazed over eyes in the other possibilities, this version of Troy had a definite look of intelligence in her eyes. And a look of abject terror. <br />
<br />
Troy could hear the cow taking deep, labored breaths, and a glance at her backside revealed that her legs were awkwardly spread while her tail was in an unusual raised position. Was she struggling to go to the bathroom or... Troy wanted to move around behind her, to confirm what he hoped wouldn&#39;t be true. But with a strange popping noise, the vision came to an abrupt end and Troy was back in the present, back in his current reality.<br />
<br />
“No!” Troy shouted and tossed the Book away as if it had burned him.<br />
<br />
He had to get out of this field. If he could get to RK-no, wait, shit-if he could get to his Book, he’d be able to change back to normal. But he had to make it back to his house.<br />
<br />
Troy looked behind him and gaped. His apartment looked incredibly far away. Much further than it had been a few minutes ago. There was almost a full mile between him and his apartment. Troy would never have walked out this far with his stomach cramps. The reality shift must have done it.<br />
<br />
No! He couldn’t give up, he had to try something. Anything. Troy tried to stand up, but his udder weighed him down. He tugged at it, but it only moved a few inches, the sensitive bag sloshing as he tried to pull it along. It was way too sensitive!<br />
<br />
He sat down, legs spread, with the heavy, full udder, and realized he needed to drain it. Maybe a good milking would let him lift it far enough of the ground so it wouldn’t scrape the dirt. He fumbled at his teats with thicker fingers than he remembered, and began milking himself. He squeezed and pulled on them, milk spurting to the ground and running warmly over the udder.<br />
<br />
It felt oddly relieving. Unbeknownst to him, his stubby tail began to extend, growing longer and longer. A tassel grew from the tip and it flicked idly on the ground behind him. Todd kept tugging, toes feeling strangely numb as the nails merged together into hooves. It wasn’t until his fingers started going numb and tangling together, interrupting his milking, that he realized something was wrong. He tried desperately to move them, pull them apart, but they stuck together, forming into useless hooves.<br />
<br />
<i>His</I> useless hooves.<br />
<br />
Troy stared at them, futilely trying to milk himself again. They wouldn’t even bend right at the wrists. Troy was so preoccupied that he never even noticed the calf wobbling up to him on legs it hadn’t gotten used to yet.<br />
<br />
“I…” Troy swallowed, realizing this was it. He composed himself and looked up into the sky. “Thanks, Loki. For everything. But...since it&#39;s only you and me out here...could you at least make sure I’m a happy cow?”<br />
<br />
The breeze caressed Troy’s cheeks, causing his udders to stiffen in delight.<br />
<br />
As Troy enjoyed the sensation of the breeze playing across his nips, he felt something  forcefully nudge him. Troy looked down and noticed a young calf nuzzling at him. It looked vaguely familiar…the vision! It was a calf from his divination! The calf found his teat and Troy realized what was about to happen as its mouth opened and-<br />
<br />
“Hey, what are you doing? Stop, get away from-Oh!” Troy gasped, cow ears waggling in delight as the calf began to suck his teat forcefully and a little painfully. It was like a tiny orgasm with each pull the calf took from his teats. “That’s...unghhh!…Oh fuck!…It...Why does it feel so good?  Nnnggh!…I can’t…Mmmm…Mmm-mmmroooo!”<br />
<br />
Troy stamped a hoof, eyes rolling at the strange pleasure nursing was giving him. He could feel the milk leaving him as it flowed through his sensitive teat. Every tug on his teat was like…well, like when his boyfriend twisted his nips. Delightfully rough. <br />
<br />
His body bulked up with each suckle. His chest barreled out, his legs stretching and lengthening longer. Soon, sitting became uncomfortable. Troy rose up into a four legged stance. The calf followed, forcefully tugging on his teat. Troy knew the calf must be contributing to the transformation somehow, but he couldn’t bring himself to push it away. It was so hungry, and he needed to feed it.<br />
<br />
Troy shook his head, wondering where the thought had come from. His spine popped as it realigned. His hips grew wide and bony. The calf suckled and suckled and Troy grew more and more content as his udder was growing light enough for him to fully lift it off the ground. The palpable sense of relief was enough for him to ignore the pulling sensation in his groin.<br />
<br />
This…this wasn’t so bad…<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until a wave of nausea struck him that Troy realized ‘he’ was becoming a ‘she’. His cock and balls were being squeezed tightly to the flesh of his taint. It kinda hurt, but mostly it felt strange. His balls felt oddly fleshy and warped. His sack squeezed tighter and tighter, the little indent that ran up the middle of his balls becoming a crevasse into a forming hole.<br />
<br />
His insides jolted and some sort of chamber opened inside of him with a pop that reminded Troy of a Tupperware lid being opened. Then, with a sense of great discomfort, his testicles slid inside of her.  She felt her cock thin and draw up above her new opening, under the spreading lips of her new beef curtains.<br />
<br />
Her insides were in turmoil for a few more moments and then slowly subsided. She had mixed feelings about her new gender, but she couldn’t deny that having a calf nursing at her teat felt oddly right, like it was the most natural thing in the world. The she felt an odd, burning need begin to grow inside her new cunt. Oh no.<br />
<br />
There was a snort behind her. She moved her head, which was steadily growing away from her body as her neck extended, and saw a huge bull standing behind her. He was overly muscled, huge dick swinging below him. She gulped, eyeing the cock in terror and lust.<br />
<br />
She was about to be <I>bred</I>. Like an animal in heat. Because, Troy realized, that&#39;s exactly what she was.<br />
<br />
Troy’s black, swollen lips winked, oozing fluid that trickled down his hind legs. The bull sniffed the air, approaching her. Troy wanted to move away, but the calf was insistent, getting underneath her legs and keeping her still for fear of tripping. All she could do was wait and shiver in delight as the calf suckled on her.<br />
<br />
She lurched forward as the bull hopped onto her back. His forelegs grappled her sides and she felt the bull thrust. His cock bounced of her ass, missing his target. Then a strange breeze arose and the bull sagged forward another few inches. He trust again, and Troy moo’d in pain and pleasure as his cock found his mark.<br />
<br />
The bull was anything but gentle he fucked her hard and rough, spreading her folds wide. The pain soon gave way to pleasure as he managed to smack her walls. She clenched on him involuntarily and felt him huff. His breath smelled like rotten grass and hay. But his musk…it made her legs quiver. <br />
<br />
Troy didn’t think bulls lasted as long as this one did. He speared her over and over again and she found herself thrusting back into him. The calf at her teat and bull in her new hole were too much for her to take. She shivered in orgasm, her vag quaking, feminine fluids gushing out around the bull’s cock.<br />
<br />
The bull gave a snort, bit down at her neck, and flooded Troy’s new womb, officially christening her as a cow. Troy’s legs shook as another orgasm overtook her. He thrust a few more times, cum squelching out around his cock, and then pulled off of her. Bull jism oozed from her hole and trickled down her leg.<br />
<br />
She panted….and then orgasmed again as the calf tugged at her nipples. Troy was a cow. And…fuck, it was kinda hot. As the bull wandered away, her stomach cramped again. She felt hot and cold, suddenly. The burning need in her groin was gone, but her udder began to swell fuller. All the hard work she’d done milking it and letting the calf nurse was undone in seconds. What was happening to her?<br />
<br />
Troy didn’t have to wait long before her questioned was answered by the feeling of a tremendous amount of pressure in her lower abdomen. It was a combination of muscle cramp, tightness, and tissue compression that felt almost like she had to take the biggest shit of her life. But as the pressure grew, Troy began to feel something else… moving inside of her.<br />
<br />
It started as a squirming. Then came a kick. Something big was inside of her. And as it kicked and squirmed it also grew. Troy could feel her stomach bloating out, both sinking down and widening as the new calf grew inside of her.<br />
<br />
As the calf grew, Troy felt everything in there getting stretched out to the point of tearing. Her abdominal muscles were so tight that they began pulling on her chest, pulling it down towards her crotch and forcing her into a slightly bowlegged stance. Meanwhile, the new weight on her rear limbs began taxing those as well, causing her to enter a half squatted position.<br />
<br />
While she hadn’t entered that position voluntarily, it did cause her chest to arch down some more, helping to relieve the tightness in her stomach and making her new, uncomfortable existences slightly more tolerable.<br />
<br />
But it wasn’t long until Troy found out about the downside of the squat. As the calf finished growing, gravity took over. With her hips now the lowest point in her new body, the calf shifted from being pulled down against her skin to “falling” into her pelvic region, painfully squeezing her insides against her hip bones.<br />
<br />
Then came the pressure they placed on her bladder. As it was squished against her hip bones, Troy found the sudden need to urinate overwhelming. It wasn’t long before she couldn’t hold it in anymore and the urine was literally forced from her body by her calf’s kicks.<br />
<br />
Troy had expected a gush of fluid to result from the loss of control over her bladder but only a few small drops came out. Evidently there hadn’t been much in there to begin with, which only served to demonstrate to Troy just how much space the new calf was taking up inside of her.<br />
<br />
Troy felt another kick that “popped” something inside of her. A brief feeling of confusion came over her as another small trickle of fluid came out of her vagina, although this time it felt like it came out of a slightly different hole…<br />
<br />
Lightning flowed through Troy’s stomach as every muscle tightened to the point of agony and began squeezing down on the calf. Unfortunately for Troy, all that managed to accomplish was smashing the calf against a wall of tough, fibrous flesh – her cervix, Troy realized.<br />
<br />
The force of the calf against her cervix was unbearable, but Troy couldn’t stop the muscles from pushing. She couldn’t even lessen the intensity. It was like her lower half just had a mind of its own and it was dead set on forcing her calf through a tightly closed hole.<br />
<br />
To her relief, it didn’t take long before she felt a ring begin to open up where the calf’s head was pressing in. Painfully, the ring grew larger and larger until she could feel the calf begin to slip out through it. She could feel its head pass through, only for it to briefly get stuck on its shoulders before they, too, passed down into her pelvis.<br />
<br />
As the calf worked its way down, tight, muscular walls both stretched to allow its passage while squeezing to force it further down.<br />
<br />
Millimeter by millimeter the calf descended further into her pelvis, making slow, painful progress. At about a third of the way down, Troy felt the calf’s skull begin to collide with her femurs, all while a wave of intense exhaustion began to wash over her.<br />
<br />
The calf slipped in between her leg bones to continue its journey towards her moist cunt.<br />
<br />
She felt a sudden pressure in her face and skull. At first, Troy wondered what was wrong, and then she saw the blocky pink nose that was thrusting steadily out from her face. Two pricks of pain stabbed her skull as small horns began to grow out. <br />
<br />
Troy thought back to her vision. That strange popping sound, could it be…She quickly realized that giving birth to the calf would be the end for her.<br />
<br />
With an enormous amount of effort, Troy felt herself clamp down, preventing herself from stretching as the calf’s head came to rest, despite the continuing contraction that was racking her body. The contractions themselves stopped a few seconds later, though to Troy it certainly felt like it took a lot longer.<br />
<br />
She panted, catching her breath. A tired smile crossed her muzzle. She&#39;d won! Troy had actually managed to defeat the Auditor!<br />
<br />
“Ah, you poor girl.” Troy heard a deep voice say behind her.<br />
<br />
She looked back, her increasingly cow-like face staring dumbly at the anthro horse. He was dressed up in overalls and not much else. The horse got out a pair of gloves and stepped towards her. Troy wanted to tell him to stop. If she birthed that calf, that would be the end for her. All that came out of her were desperate moos.<br />
<br />
The buff horse moved up to her head, inspecting her with his hands. Clint was soon standing in front of Troy, rubbing behind her ears and making shushing sounds. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay, sweetheart. I know, Big Mama, I know it hurts.” Clint scratched under her increasingly longer chin and looked her in the eyes. “I’m gonna help you out.”<br />
<br />
The words were meant to reassure her, but Troy was anything but. Clint’s hand trailed along her side, letting her know where he was, as any good farmer would do for an animal in distress. He kept making soothing noise, saying things that were rapidly becoming nonsense in Troy’s mind. Finally, the anthro horse came to her rear entrance and lifted her tail out of the way. She stared at him in terror, eyes wide in fright-<br />
<br />
He gripped the calf’s head and pulled.<br />
<br />
Troy’s face popped and crackled. Her head grew big and heavy, muzzle stretching out like taffy. It was almost painless, but the increased pressure on her brain as her skull deformed felt like her head was in a vise. She managed one last, quick thought-<I>At least it’s over</I>, and then her skull popped into place and she was just another cow.<br />
<br />
Big horseman patted her flank happily and moved out of the way as she nuzzled at the tiny form on the ground behind her. She licked the after birth from her new calf. It stumbled awkwardly to its hooves and wobbled underneath her, joining her other calf. The cow let them nurse, enjoying the tugs and accompanying jolts of pleasure. Idly, she wished she’d given birth to more. <br />
<br />
As though there was a god listening to her thoughts, the big horseman led two more calves over to her. He patted her, kissed her forehead, then left as the calves began fighting over her last two teats. The suckling was gentle, insistent and just as pleasurable. Troy moo’d contentedly, shivering in delight with every tug.<br />
<br />
Her tail swatted at a fly as her calves nursed. She wasn’t sure what had bothered her so much. This was her favorite part of the field, where she could see the big horseman’s barn and watch the skunkman and dogman in their yard. The cow bent her neck down, the bell around her throat jangling, and mouthed a tuft of grass, chewing, swallowing it. Big horseman came out several times. He’d pet her, scratch her neck, whisper soothing nonsense in her ears. She loved big horseman. <br />
<br />
As the cow cudded and her eyes dulled, the Book of Divination shimmered in the grass and…<br />
<br />
“Huh? What’s this?” Big horseman spoke.<br />
<br />
Troy’s ears flicked, not able to parse the words. Her head turned and she saw big horseman standing somewhere nearby. In his hands was a thick leather book. She wasn’t sure what had made her big horseman raise his voice in surprise, but he wasn’t running, so she continued to graze.<br />
<br />
And so the game continued on, without her.</p>
