<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Allen made Peter change for the second time, he allowed him to shrink back, as Steve climbed the ladder to get out of the pool.<br />
<br />
Allen quickly ordered Peter’s huge, 30-foot body to shrink back down to his original height, around 6 foot and 3 inches tall.<br />
<br />
“I’m… I’m sorry Coach… I couldn’t help it… I didn’t mean to scare you so much, that you would fall in the pool…” Peter pleaded with Steve.<br />
<br />
Steve walked right up to Peter, and looked him straight in the eye. <br />
<br />
“Peter, if you weren’t the best swimmer on my team, I’d have you selling hotdogs during the football games until you graduate from high school…” Steve said calmly.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Coach… I have these growth spurts… They just happen… I have no control over them…” Peter continued.<br />
<br />
“Look, Peter…” Steve instructed. “You go to class, you do your homework, and you come here and you swim your laps in the pool. Is that perfectly clear? Your life consists of books, food, sleep, clothing, and being in the water in the pool behind me. There is no room in your life for parties, trips, or girls!”<br />
<br />
Peter just gulped when the coach announced the restrictions he had imposed on him.<br />
<br />
“Do you have a problem with that, boy?” Steve asked him.<br />
<br />
Peter just stared at his coach with his big, blue eyes.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m alright with that, Coach…” he whispered in reply. He was well aware of the fact that Steve could easily remove him from the swim team, if he wanted to.<br />
<br />
“What? No girls?” Peter heard Allen’s voice exclaim inside of him. “Who does he think he is?”<br />
<br />
“Allen! Please… I’m in enough trouble already! Don’t do anything to me… Please!” Peter thought, hoping Allen would hear him.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think this should be too hard on you…” Steve added. “I hardly ever see you with any girls anyway! Girls just aren’t interested in you…”<br />
<br />
“What?” Allen exclaimed inside of Peter’s mind. “How can you stand there and listen to him, while he’s putting you down like that, Peter? Wait… I’m gonna show him a thing or two…”<br />
<br />
“Uh oh…” Peter whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Peter’s feet were frozen at the spot where he was standing. He couldn’t move!<br />
<br />
Peter’s muscles suddenly started to grow! He didn’t grow into a thirty-foot giant this time, but he still became extremely muscular!<br />
<br />
“Uhhhhhh!!!” Peter groaned, as he felt his muscles as they expanded, thanks to Allen’s incredible powers. He didn’t grow any taller at all, however his legs became like thick pillars of muscles, which were as thick as the stump of an oak tree!<br />
<br />
Steve’s mouth dropped wide open, as he stood and watched while his swimmer grew right before his very eyes.<br />
<br />
“Eeeeeyyyaaaaaaaahhhhhh!” Peter screamed, as his pecs inflated and shot out before the rest of his body by a foot. His calves became the size as rock-solid soccer balls. Three rows of large, thick and deep abdominal muscles surfaced over his flat stomach. His arms became longer and thicker to the point where they were as big as pythons. His shoulders widened considerably, to the point where his lats had grown because of the V-shape on his back. <br />
<br />
“My goodness… How is this possible? You’re growing right before my very own eyes…” Steve wondered out loud, while he watched Peter’s body change as it became extremely muscular.<br />
<br />
Peter’s shoulders were about four feet wide! His pectorals resembled large, hard spheres of rock-solid muscle. His biceps resembled bowling balls which were implanted on his arms. His forearms were extremely wide and thick as well, giving him the Popeye-look!<br />
<br />
Next, Peter’s black Speedo began to expand, as it slowly covered every inch of his body. First, it traveled down his legs. Long, black leather boots had formed around his feet and lengthened just above the calves. Shining, smooth black leather pants covered his legs from the boots and higher. <br />
<br />
A black, leather jacket formed out of the Speedo, and covered his torso, shoulders and his arms as well. He was suddenly wearing black, leather gloves on his hands.<br />
<br />
Still, Peter had become so muscular, that his muscles still showed, even through the black, leather outfit!<br />
<br />
Thin chains of silver and gold appeared hanging from several small clips on Peter’s leather jacket. They formed on his sleeves, gloves, and on his boots near the ankles.<br />
<br />
The leather suit formed on Peter’s body, covering him almost as if it had become a second skin for him. Every muscle was clearly visible through the black leather, making him all shining and imposing!<br />
<br />
Peter’s arms were so thick, that he couldn’t even let them hang straight down from his sides! His biceps and triceps were so huge, that they made his arms hang at a forty-five degree angle from the side of his body.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Peter’s light-brown hair began to change color as it rapidly darkened. His hair grew thicker and longer as it transformed from light brown to jet black! He now had slightly longer, straight, black hair!<br />
<br />
His hair grew in the back, curling slightly as it hung until it touched his shoulders. Lipstick suddenly appeared on his lips, and nail polish formed a layer on his nails. He looked incredible! A gold chain appeared hanging around his neck as well. Peter was now completely covered in black leather, draped with chains of gold and silver.<br />
<br />
“What the heck…” Steve exclaimed. “Where did this fancy outfit pop up from?”<br />
<br />
And, lastly, a generous bulge had formed in Peter’s shining, leather pants. Allen made sure he had all the right bases covered. He was determined to change Peter into the most attractive guy on the planet!<br />
<br />
“And, you have all that hair! It’s much too long! No swimmer on my team is going to walk around with hair like that, is that understood?” Steve shouted angrily at the boy.<br />
<br />
“I… I… I’m sorry…” Peter uttered in reply. He was at a loss of words, for he knew that Allen had changed him.<br />
<br />
“Get rid of that hair! And right this minute!” Steve ordered.<br />
<br />
Immediately, some of Peter’s long, black hair started to fall off of him! Hair just came off his scalp, making him appear bald on the edges of his scalp, but leaving a row of hair down the center of his head. Next, the remaining hairs on his head became hard, as if grease was poured on them. A row of hair rose up, sticking straight up from the top of his head. The row of hair extended from just above his forehead to the back of his head, forming a long, tall, thick Mohawk on Peter’s nearly-bald head!<br />
<br />
Peter’s hair now resembled a row of thick, long spikes, which were neatly lined up on the center of his head! He had a black Mohawk!<br />
<br />
“Oh my gosh… This is freaky…” Steve said to himself. He was in disbelief. Did he just see Peter transform from a swimmer into a glam rocker in a matter of a minute or two?<br />
<br />
Peter was covered in black leather, while his huge muscles were still clearly visible. His entire body would shine the moment the rays of the sun would strike him. His appearance was breathtaking!<br />
<br />
Next, Allen wished for Peter to become a girl-magnet of unknown proportions! Within moments, three girls walked up to the pool area, where the chairs were placed for the public. They walked right up to Peter, without even glancing at Steve. <br />
<br />
“Heeeeeyyyyyy, Peter…” one of the girls said, as she stood right before him and gently passed her palm of her hand over his leather jacket, where the outline of his huge pectorals was clearly visible. “You look so awesome…”<br />
<br />
Peter blushed a little. He really didn’t know what to say.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God, Peter… You’re such an incredible stud…” the other girl whispered. <br />
<br />
Two other girls surrounded him, and they all admired his leather suit, his muscles, and his Mohawk on top of his head.<br />
<br />
“You’re such an incredible hunk of a man…” the third girl uttered, as she admired his huge muscles while running her hands over his large biceps.<br />
<br />
Then, the three of them walked away, with Peter in the middle.<br />
<br />
“See ya, Coach… I gotta spend some time with my girls…” Peter smirked. <br />
<br />
Steve could just stand there, staring at Peter and his girls. He was in complete shock! Peter had proven to be bigger, stronger, and more attractive to girls than him in every way!<br />
<br />
Of course, Steve had no idea that Allen had the power to change Peter in any way he wanted to. Steve realized that he had been a bit too hard on Peter, and he decided to tone down his rhetoric a little. In the meantime, he couldn’t help but laugh, when he saw Peter and the three girls, as they walked away from the swimming pool.<br />
<br />
Allen had transformed Peter into the most muscular and the most attractive guy in school.<br />
<br />
What was Allen going to do to him next?</p>
