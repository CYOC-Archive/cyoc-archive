<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The coaster was a classic wooden affair, though decked out in the same neon accents as the rest of the park; tubes of light ran along the track, a bright purple near the ground that transitioned along the colors of the rainbow until they were a bright red at the two peaks of the track. Below the neon, the sides of the coaster were studded with a mesh of lights, close packed LEDs that displayed a myriad of images from bouncing shapes and patterns to waveforms and line graphs.<br />
<br />
The carousel, while not as tall, made up for it with girth. The structure was impossibly large, with a diameter roughly the length of a football field. Despite its incredible size, it rotated at a steady speed, gliding smoothly on silent mechanisms. The only sounds emanating from it were the shouts of joy from the riders and the ride’s music, a bouncy blend of electronica and parade music that bounced traditional horns and concertina notes off a deep bass that reverberated through the air surrounding the ride.<br />
<br />
The carousel was structurally similar to the traditional rides the boys were familiar with from their youth; bright red paint with shiny gold trim gave color to what appeared to be a largely wooden frame. The ride vehicles were a combination of traditional and modern; wooden horses and painted chariots danced next to scale sports cars and metallic rocket ships.<br />
<br />
The carousel’s neon accents glowed along the golden trim, flowed out from under the ride, and radiated from inside the translucent glass of the drop rods. The dotted incandescent bulbs and trails of neon were mesmerizing as they spun in speedy circles, drawing the pair closer as they took in every detail of the ride.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until the ride slowed down that the pair realized they’d wondered to within a dozen meters of it, just outside the queue. They watched as dazed riders descended from vehicles, stumbling on unsure legs as though they were just waking from a deeply relaxing dream.<br />
<br />
Matthew elbowed James softly and pointed to one such patron, a young woman who was staggering towards the exit, simultaneously struggling to hold up her oversized cargo pants and push an unruly, but cute, mass of blonde hair from her face. The pair laughed as she bumped into a ride vehicle, briefly dropping her pants and boxers to her thighs before she caught them, exposing her pert butt to the waiting riders.<br />
<br />
After she scrambled to pull her pants up and move along, the pair shared a nod and headed towards the ride entrance. On the way, they passed a few more patrons who had noticeably ill-fitting clothing, something James realized was odd, but just as quickly dismissed. It seemed so unimportant amidst all the lights and sounds of the carnival. What mild concern there was fizzled away as they joined the other graduates in the fast moving line to board the ride.<br />
<br />
“Oh shit,” Matthew perked up as he spotted a cooler at one corner of the cue, propped open and filled to the brim with ice and beer. He snatched a couple bottles as they passed by and handed one off to the James, who was still nursing what was left of his first beer.<br />
<br />
James held the quarter full bottle up meekly, “I’m still working on this one.”<br />
<br />
Matthew snatched the bottle from James’s hand and chucked it carelessly over his shoulder with a playful grunt, “Now you’re ready for a fresh one.”<br />
<br />
James paused for a moment, watching the bottle sail end over end as a spiral of fizzy liquid sprayed from it. As it plummeted towards the ground, surprise shifted to interest and a smile spread across his face as he watched the bottle pang off one of the colorful awnings of the midway and land in the grass. He took a sip of his fresh beer as he turned back to Matthew, only slightly aware he didn’t recall when or how he’d popped the cap from the bottle.<br />
The line kept moving, sweeping the two along with its current as they closed in on the ride. As they reached the polished wooden steps leading to the ride proper, they spotted a sign listing several rules for riding. In particular, the list of what was allowed on the ride caught their attention:<br />
<br />
•	Feel free to board with your favorite alcoholic beverage, tobacco product, or personal toy; have fun and do what feels natural<br />
<br />
“Tobacco products?” Matthew mused as they walked along the ride vehicles, looking for two open seats next to each other.<br />
<br />
“You suppose the park has cigarettes or cigars or something?”<br />
Matthew held up his beer, “They have these, I don’t see why they wouldn’t have that stuff too.”<br />
James nodded thoughtfully, “But what does it mean by personal toys?”<br />
<br />
Matthew shrugged, then upended his beer, dumping the rest of the contents down his throat before chucking the bottle off the ride. “Beats me, probably means the prizes you can win at the carnival games or some shit.”<br />
James glanced down as Matthew pulled himself up on a colorful wooden horse. James’s eyes fell briefly on his friend’s backside as he straddled the saddle, but any associated thoughts were lost as the ride lurched forward, starting up once more. The young man pivoted and pulled himself onto a similarly colorful polished equine, grabbing hold of the drop rod to stead himself before moving to a liquored pommel attached to the front of the saddle.<br />
<br />
The boy’s shared an excited glance as the ride picked up speed. The lights flickered and pulsed in time with the music as the tempo increased. A large number of mirrors around the central column and hanging from the ceiling at odd angles made it feel like there were infinitely more lights than there were. As the rides speed increased, it felt more and more like they were floating in a void, bouncing up and down slowly as music enveloped them in a void of neon as the rest of the world pulled further away in every direction.<br />
<br />
James sighed as he leaned forward against the glowing drop rod, his focus scattering as the matrix of light and sound washed over him. He was concerned he’d feel dizzy or sick, but the sensation rippling through him was a comfortable warmth, like being coddled in a thick blanket. He glanced at Matthew, who, judging by the look on his face as he hugged his own drop rod, was experiencing the same enveloping numbness he was.<br />
<br />
James gasped softly as he realized he was rocking his hips in time with the motions of the carousel, his crotch rubbing softly but effectively against the hard pommel resting between his legs. He glanced around nervously, doing his best to focus long enough to see if anyone else had noticed what he was doing. Despite his apprehension, his hips didn’t stop their motion, continuing to stimulate his body as he looked around.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, everyone around him seemed lost in their own world as much as he had been. A girl seated in a nearby rocket ship looked to be having as much fun as he was, her hands down inside the cockpit as her chest rose and fell in time with the up and down motion of the ride. A shock of warmth rippled through James as his eyes held on her small but perky chest a little longer than he’d intended.<br />
<br />
Turning back to Matthew, he blushed as he watched his friend rubbing his body up and down against the drop rod, caressing it with his cheek as his hands stroked over it suggestively. The look on Matthew’s face was one of pure bliss, however, as if he were with the hottest cheerleader in school.<br />
<br />
Satisfied nobody was paying attention to him, James’s focus returned to his own enjoyment. Though a bit weirded out by how stimulating the ride seemed to be for everyone on board, his concern washed away by a strong pulse of pleasure from his groin. He moaned softly as he rocked into it, letting himself go completely as he gave into the stimulation of the hard plastic against his hard…<br />
<br />
James murmured and rolled his hips slowly in confusion.<br />
Why wasn’t he hard?<br />
The stimulation he was getting from the hard pommel was some of the best he’d ever felt, but for some reason, his cock was just flopping limply inside his boxers, unwilling to do what came naturally to a young man in the throes of passion.<br />
<br />
If anything, it felt like muscles were tensing and pulling in, knotting up in unnatural ways. It wasn’t an uncomfortable sensation, at least not physically. Each pulse of movement was a wave of pleasure that encouraged further rocking which intensified the changes. His scrotum felt like it had pulled tight against his body and his dick was twisting in on itself, but that only drove him to rub harder against the pommel, his movements pushing him forward as he slowly worked his way out of the saddle and on top of the horn.<br />
<br />
His fingers traced over the smooth plastic of the horn, curious thoughts punctured his addled mind as the pulling sensation in his crotch grew in intensity with each passing pulse of perverse pleasure. He felt confused as conflicting thoughts tugged at him. Beyond a mindless blaze of pleasure, he was having trouble figuring out what he wanted. He wanted the pleasure to continue, that was for sure, but clumsily pushing himself against the pommel horn felt ineffective, like he was doing it something wrong. He needed to do something different, something more.<br />
He gasped as an orgasmic pulse of pleasure rippled out from his crotch, accompanied by a moment of extreme tightness followed by an audible pop.<br />
<br />
He needed it inside him.<br />
<br />
An irresistible moan flowed from his mouth as he pulled himself onto the horn, clumsily rubbing it against a nebulous pleasure center between his legs. An additional wave of bliss pulsed out, forcing his hips out against the waistband of his pants before rippling up his body, relaxing him deeply and dropping him forward against the glowing neon rod linking his mount to the main structure. As his limp body rocked up and down with the ride, he managed to turn his gaze to his fellow riders.<br />
<br />
Matthew’s chest was pressed against the glowing purple drop rod, rising and falling in and out in time with the rise and fall of the ride, the rod sliding between two soft mounds tenting his shirt.<br />
<br />
James’s head swam as he struggled to process the sight before him. He knew what he was seeing was wrong, that Matthew shouldn’t have a pair of breasts, but he couldn’t deny they were cute. Very cute. They looked good and proper, like they belonged there. He turned his attention to the young woman riding the rocket, watching as her loose shirt rippled with the speed of the ride, flapping against her flat chest. Her head was pressed against the seatback, her eyes closed as she took deep, forced breaths. She tensed up and rocked softly several times before her body went slack, her shoulders relaxing as she sunk down against the leather seat.<br />
<br />
As the ride slowed down, the haze of pleasure and dizziness waned. The first grounded sensation James felt was an unnatural tightness in his hips, his belt pulled tightly against them. He absently fumbled at the buckle, intent on moving it to a looser punch hole, but all he managed was to clumsily undo it and let it hang open, grunting in relief as the pressure relented. He slid back into the saddle, foreign yet comfortable sensations radiating from his hips and groin as he adjusted his position. Realization crept in, leading his hands in exploration, first to his wider hips, then to his thighs, and finally to his groin. Realization gave way to shock as he encountered something completely foreign to his rational mind. His hands slid into his pants, fingers searching over an altered front and sliding down between his legs before finding-<br />
“Oh fuck.”<br />
<br />
James snatched his hand from his pants, face burning as a pulse of light pleasure rippled through him, trailing off as the ride came to a stop. The young man wrapped an arm around the drop rod, using it for support as he clumsily stumbled from the horse, nearly falling to the ground as he struggled to manage an unfamiliar center of gravity. He leaned over the backside of the horse, focused on his breathing as he watched the young woman lift herself from the rocket.<br />
<br />
She hopped from the ride vehicle, whistling softly as she adjusted her shirt, either unaware or unconcerned at the loss of her feminine chest. Glancing down, his eyes came to rest on a visible mound, pulsing ever so slightly, in the crotch of her jeans, outlined clearly against the soft material. She stretched her arms over her head and arced her back, further emphasizing the changes to her front.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until she turned to walk away that the young man realized he’d been staring, thoughts drifting to foreign desires that were both confusing and compelling. Still bracing himself on the shiny rear of the colorful horse, he turned to check on Matthew.<br />
<br />
James’s friend had definitely recovered from the daze the ride had put them in, though he seemed far less concerned with their changes. Matthew had a pleased smile on his face as he slowly massaged the additions to his chest, rubbing in slow circles over the modest but perky pair that tented his top. Glancing down, James blushed at the sight of another tent his friend seemed unconcerned with. Looking up from his chest, Matthew locked eyes on James and started walking towards him with a dazed look of lust in his eyes. His cock strained against his pants, a slight dampness gracing its tip. Idly, Matt stroked it as he gazed at James and continued towards him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um....Matthew....what are you doing?&quot; James asked...astonished.</p>
