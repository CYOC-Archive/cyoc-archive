<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephanie couldn't do much to cover her collar and bracelets but she decided to do what she could so they wouldn't look out of place.  She was worried that she wouldn't have anything to wear but that fear disappeared as soon as she entered her room.  What had been a bright pink room with a small twin size bed and some drawers had been replaced with a Gothic master suite.  <br />
<br />
The walls were covered in posters of men and women in sexual positions, which Stephanie found very educational.  On one wall was a rack with various bonds, whips, ball gags, and other tools.  Her bed was a queen sized four poster with red drapes and a black walnut headboard.  On the ceiling, Stephanie saw a large mirror.<br />
<br />
I can see Jeff messed with my room. Stephanie thought, not sure how to take it.  Where her drawers had been, was a door to a deep walk in closet, with hundreds of outfits, most of which couldn't be worn outside the house.  She grabbed a blue top with spaghetti straps and threw on a leather jacket.  She also grabbed a black skirt that went down to her ankles but had a slit in the side that went up to her thigh.  It was the best she could do on such short notice.<br />
<br />
Stephanie ran out the door to see her friend Crystal and her mom in a yellow convertible waiting for her.  &quot;Oh good, I was just about to get out and knock.&quot; Crystal said then she noticed what Stephanie was wearing.  &quot;Damn, I can't believe you're parents let you walk out like that.  You're so lucky, my Mom made me wear this silly outfit.&quot;  Crystal smoothed out the wrinkles in her old t-shirt and faded jeans.  Crystal's Mom cut in, &quot;Crystal, I don't want you using such language.  Crystal's right Stephanie, that outfit is a little much for going to see a movie with some of your friends.  Maybe I should talk to your mom...&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie thought about how if Crystal's mom butted in to Master Jeff's fun, then she would be manipulated.  Stephanie thought about trying out some of the things on her wall and she found the thoughts exciting.  Stephanie wanted to see it but Master Jeff might punish her even more and what she had to do was humiliating enough.  &quot;It's OK, and if we don't hurry, we'll be late to the movie.&quot;  Stephanie pointed out.  Crystal's mom looked unconvinced but then let it go.<br />
<br />
Stephanie and Crystal were dropped off at the theater with the money for their tickets.  They met Susan and Cloe there and the four girls bought their tickets for a movie.  Stephanie wasn't paying to much attention to anything because the moment she entered the theater, she began to feel slightly uncomfortable.  It was little things, like her skirt feeling a little tight and the tag on her shirt agitating her.  The girls didn't talk to each other, for which Stephanie was grateful, as the lights turned off and irritation got even stronger.  <br />
<br />
By the time the movie had actually started Stephanie felt like her shirt had constricted and was driving the air out of her lungs.  Her skirt felt like it was made out of burlap and was itching like crazy.  Her jacket felt like it was made out of lead and was crushing her into her seat.  Eventually it became unbearable as she took her coat off, coming off as easily as a feather.  Stephanie was able to last a couple more minutes without the weight of the jacket but now the skirt felt like it was made out of thistles and shift of her legs, sent shooting pains through her legs.  Her top had constricted so much that she could only pant with frustration.  Stephanie knew she was making to much of a commotion when she saw that Crystal and Susan were staring at her with looks of confusion.  &quot;Are you going to be alright?&quot; Cloe asked, noticing Stephanie's pained expression.  <br />
<br />
Stephanie wanted to shout out that nothing was right, that she had to go to the bathroom but Master Jeff had ordered her to undress herself so her friends could see her new outfit.  So in a husky voice she said, &quot;I will be, I just need to do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie's friends watched in shock as Stephanie took off her top, so constrictive before but flowing loosely off her as if it had been baggy.  As she pulled off the skirt a soothing sensation went down her legs to calm her irritation.  The feeling was sensational and unexpected that Stephanie couldn't help but shudder with relief and gasp with elation.  Crystal was unable to contain herself and whispered furiously, &quot;What in hell are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie wasn't sure what to do but she knew they wouldn't accept the truth so she hoped she could sound believable, &quot;It's OK Crystal, Jeff bet me a hundred dollars that I wouldn't do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you're such a whore.&quot;  Susan said in shock, &quot;I can't believe you're doing this.  Just put your clothes back on before someone notices.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie shook her head, &quot;I can't, sorry.&quot;  Crystal grabbed Stephanie's arm and looked like she was about to cry, &quot;Quit lying to us Stephanie.  I've been your best friend since we we're babies and I know when you're lying to me.  What's really going on?&quot;  Stephanie didn't know what came over her but almost instinctively she slapped Crystal in the face, and all eyes were on her as she bit off her words quickly, a cold look in her eyes, and a cruel sneer on her lips.  &quot;I don't have to tell you anything you insipid little cunt.  I should tie you up and whip you for daring to lay a finger on your mistress without my...&quot; and then the sneer disappeared and her eyes lost their coldness and only appeared confused.  Realizing what she had done, seeing the tears in Crystal's eyes, Stephanie blinked and got up to leave, &quot;I'm sorry, so sorry, I don't know what came over me.  Stay away from me, you hear me? All of you, it's not safe.&quot;  She was babbling at the end and started to repeat herself over and over again and ran out the theater.  Cursing her luck she began running home,  her heels tap tapping against the cold concrete.  She stayed to the back roads, hoping not to be picked up by the cops.  On the way back she looked at her metal collar and noticed it now had a dog tag which said Jeff's Bitch.<br />
<br />
Stephanie wanted to eviscerate the son of a bitch but she couldn't do anything to him.  When she got home she was unsurprised to see Slave-Mom and Jeff doing it on the couch while her dad stood naked, looking like he spent months at the gym, a stark contrast to the middle aged man with the growing belly that had left this morning.  Thinning hair had been thickened and darkened a lovely shade of black.  His mouth was shut with a grimace but what ever he wanted to say was being held back.  &quot;Oh, Stephanie is back.&quot; said Slave-Mom.  Jeff pinched her butt and Slave-Mom let out a girlish giggle and pressed in close.  &quot;Dad, I had a very bad night.  I'd apologize for taking it out on you, but you fathered the bastard that did this to me.&quot;  Jeff laughed at that and it only infuriated Stephanie even more.  &quot;Come with me, Jeff redecorated my room and I really need to break it in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie didn't notice that Jeff's laughter had stopped as she dragged her Dad upstairs.  Little did she know that Jeff hadn't done any thing to her room.  He had only made changes to Stephanie.  Jeff decided he would have to investigate the matter further, after he and Slave-Mom were done for the night.  After all, Jeff did have his priorities.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, at the movie theater, three girls were discussing their strange night amoung themselves.  &quot;I tell you something isn't right.  I know Stephanie can be a little selfish but that was completely out of character for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I know you want to think the best of her but after what she said...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you see, it's what she said that makes me think something is horribly wrong.  I think she needs our help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe that you want to see her after how she just acted.  Whatever's happening it's none of our business.  We should just leave her alone and let her cool down.  I'm sure this will all blow over and then we can get back to being friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this is serious and I'm going to go see her, with or with out you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been pretty quiet, what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The look in her eyes, that wasn't the Stephanie I know.  Something is going on but I think we should stay out of it.  There's this feeling of danger I keep getting.  Promise me you won't go alone to face whatever this is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise.&quot;</p>
