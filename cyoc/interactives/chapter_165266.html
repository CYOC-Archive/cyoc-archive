<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The very next day Tylin was up and thinking to herself,&quot;You’re gonna do it today.&quot; She took a deep breath as she got ready wondering which form she should ask him out in. On one claw she spent most of her life in her feral body and was used to it, on the other in her anthro form she might be able to show off a bit. Assuming she was about the same age she was when she first met Nazaric, her breasts were surprisingly large for her age, and were in the C cup range.<br />
<br />
As soon as Tylin was ready she looked over at Nazaric and said,&quot;Mom I’m heading to that realm where all of the dragons were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay sweetheart, good luck out there,&quot; Nazaric smiled,&quot;Just wish yourself back here when you’re done, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin nodded, Tylin had barely even used her wishing ability since she transformed. The only times she has used it were for minor things like transportation, getting used to her body, and minor alterations here and there, but never anything major, especially since she’s been learning magic from her mom. While she was in the dragon realm Tylin’s  parents made sure people knew she was their daughter, her hand had a brand on it that was the crest of Nazaric. Brands for dragons were like tattoos for humans, and they didn’t really hurt because they were being put onto the scales instead of the flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was in the dragon realm.... a-and that I could find my... c-crush,&quot; Tylin gulped as a portal opened up in front of her to the dragon realm. Ty took a deep breath and stepped through before closing the portal and shifting into her anthro form and looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zarkin....&quot; Tylin started thinking about him again, and she was having second thoughts, &#39;D-Does he even know who I am? I-I’m not very social.... what if he doesn’t kn-know my name?&#39;<br />
<br />
Tylin started wandering around until she got to a tree that overlooked a small clearing that had a dirt circle dug out. Tylin knee males sometimes liked to brawl and test each other’s strength, and right now there were five teens going at it. These brawls weren’t really brawls, more like Olympic style wrestling but on all fours. Tylin recognized a few of the boys as some that Zarkin would hang around and at the moment she saw Zarkin, that muscular looking navy blue dragon going all out on one of his friends.<br />
<br />
At the last moment Tylin watched Zarkin pin his friend, and hid behind the tree and continued to think. &#39;W-Why did he have to be all sweaty and musky now?! Oh.... M-Mom why is he such a stud?&#39; Tylin thought then gulped and muttered,&quot;I-I wish that I was confident... e-enough to g-go out there and ask him out.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin the took a deep breath and sighed then threw caution into the wind and walked out towards them. The boys continued doing what they were doing until one of them looked up, and immediately recognized Tylin, nudging one of the others and whispering to his friends before they looked at her too. Even Zarkin and the guy who was fighting stopped and looked over at Tylin before immediately stopping what they were doing.<br />
<br />
Tylin’s nervousness only got worse the closer she got, and she was starting to wonder why they were all staring at her. &#39;S-Shit, they’re all looking at me now... why are they looking at me? R-Right, your mother happens to be their goddess right? B-But what if it isn’t that?&#39; Tylin thought then shook her head and gulped closed her eyes,&#39;G-Get yourself together Tylin, get the old Ty back out.... and...&#39; Tylin then suddenly tripped up and fell forwards face first onto the ground. She wasn’t paying attention and accidentally tripped on the dirt ring that had been dug out to form the brawling arena.<br />
<br />
&#39;Damnit! Oh no they’re all going to think I’m some kind of clutz now!&#39; Tylin thought before she heard a concerned voice ask,&quot;Hey are you okay?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin blushed and looked up slowly, and it was him... Zarkin and he was offering her his hand. &#39;Th-Thank you Mom.....&#39; Tylin thought you herself since her mother was the equivalent of god at this point. &quot;U-Uh... th-thanks....&quot; Tylin replied before taking his hand and allowing him to pull her to her feet.<br />
<br />
Tylin looked into his eyes and blushed heavily as all of the guys congregated up just behind Zarkin. At first Tylin was thinking they’d be like,&#39;Why is a girl here? Bro’s before hoes,&#39; or some shit like that. However all of them just seemed.... nervous, and Zarkin was the most nervous looking out of all of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-So... I-I Erm.... w-why are.... y-you here Uh...?&quot; One of the guys behind Zarkin asked and Tylin gulped then whimpered,&quot;O-Oh... s-Sorry... w-was I Uh... i-interrupting s-something.... I-I didn’t mean to.... Uh... m-make you mad at me....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mad....?&quot; Another guy muttered and he and his friend looked at each other looking confused.<br />
<br />
Zarkin then smiled a bit awkwardly and nervously chuckled,&quot;So uh.... why is... o-our uh... goddess’s daughter visiting a bunch of l-lowly mortals?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;This is the moment Tylin,&#39; Tylin thought to herself then gulped and nervously put her hands around her back while twisting her foot against the ground and looking back up at Zarkin. &quot;B-Because.... I-I wanted.... t-to ask you out.... Z-Zarkin....&quot; Tylin whimpered then smiled awkwardly at Zarkin who’s eyes went wide and he muttered,&quot;What....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarkin dropped his hands to the sides and stared at Tylin, meanwhile his friends all looked like they were freaking out behind him. One was about to scream, but then another covered his mouth looking equally nervous. Then the third looked just looked frozen before the one covering his friend’s mouth started guiding the other two away.<br />
<br />
After an awkward silence Tylin gulped and added,&quot;W-Well.... w-will y-you like t-to do that...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarkin, who looked like he was about to faint, blinked twice then shook his head and said,&quot;Y-You.... you’re asking.... ME?!?! A-am I dreaming?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin blushed and shook her head then groaned,&quot;N-No... b-but.... ooooh.... I knew this was a mistake....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?! N-No, I’d love to! It’s just......&quot; Zarkin took a deep breath and sighed,&quot;Holy shit.... that was..... surprising.... but.... relieving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Relieving?&quot; Tylin asked seeing just how nervous he looked before compared to now.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Well.... f-funny story....&quot; Zarkin took a deep breath and exclaimed,&quot;I-I thought you were cute... when you... first came here with your mother... and uh.... I-I wanted to ask you out. B-Buuuut, heh, there was and is... so much I don’t know about you, and you’re so quiet... and well.... shy I still don’t know your name,&quot; Zarkin laughed awkwardly before clearing his throat,&quot;A-Also because I thought if I fucked it all up that your parents would hate me, and possibly even do something unspeakably horrible to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Huh?!&quot; Tylin blushed and looked astounded, he was just as nervous as she was about all of this, but this did raise a few questions for Tylin,&quot;W-Why would my parents do something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarkin pauses and looked at Tylin then chuckled,&quot;You.... are the daughter of our one and only goddess.... a-and the creator of our entire race and world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin paused and suddenly the reality check hit her and she blushed,&quot;O-Oh right... my mother wouldn’t do that... sh-she’s actually.... the reason I even I had enough courage to even try to ask you today. M-My name is Tylin, b-by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarkin nodded then said,&quot;C-Can you give me a minute really quick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin paused then nodded,&quot;O-Oh uh sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarkin nodded and Tylin watched him walk off into the woods, and 30 seconds later you heard him roar out,&quot;HOLY SHIT THANK YOU!!!!&quot; Before he emerged from the forest a couple minutes later and smiled awkwardly,&quot;I’m back,&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin blushed after he did this and asked,&quot;What w-w-was that a-all about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just well.... needed to get that out of my system... so uh..... well.... geez I don’t even know how I should treat someone of your caliber,&quot; Zarkin said rubbing his head looking nervous.<br />
<br />
Tylin then smiled and slowly took his hand,&quot;W-W-Well.... h-h-how about y-you just t-treat m-me l-like any other f-female who would a-ask you out? I-I don’t want any special t-treatment because of w-who m-my parents are. P-P-Plus... I-I-I r-really gotta get o-out more....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay....&quot; Zarkin said looking down at Tylin’s hand holding his before looking back up at her,&quot;Wow.... s-so uh.... boyfriend a-and girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sure,&quot; Tylin said smiling and Zarkin nodded and uttered,&quot;You’re beautiful....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What w-was that?&quot; Tylin asked and Zarkin blushed heavily,&quot;N-NoTHIng uh...&quot; Zarkin’s voice cracked and he took a moment to clear his throat and said,&quot;Would you uh... like to go somewhere and talk, where WE AREN’T BEING WATCHED?!&quot; As Zarkin said this he glared over at a bush, and after he said this it rustled like people were running off.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What was...?&quot; Tylin muttered and Zarkin sighed,&quot;My dumb friends.... Now, I know just the place where we can be alone and get to know one another, you okay with following me there?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tylin gulped and slowly nodded and said,&quot;Y-Yeah....&quot; Zarkin smiled and gave Tylin a hug and said,&quot;Thank you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin’s cheeks turned bright red,&#39;Holy shit he’s hugging me now...!&#39; She realized how much of a fan girl she sounded like in her mind, and Zarkin paused before releasing Tylin from his embrace,&quot;U-Uh.... t-too soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tylin blushed and paused before walking up to Zarkin and hugging him back, nuzzling his chest,&quot;N-No.... I-I’m j-just what y-you would c-call antisocial....&quot; Zarkin smiles and slowly hugged Tylin back, embracing her and rubbing her back and wings then said,&quot;L-Let’s just take it slow then, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay, I-I n-never really had... friends before outside of my parents... if that counts.... much less a boyfriend, so.... I’d l-like that a lot,&quot; Tylin giggled awkwardly and Zarkin nodded and the two released each other from the hug. Zarkin then took Tylin’s hand and said,&quot;Just follow me, and uh.... m-maybe keep that mark of yours on your claw... hidden if you want to be treated as... well.... normal for me I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah... okay,&quot; Tylin smiled and nodded before Zarkin started walking and Tylin followed right next to him, still holding hands. Now where do they go?</p>
