<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Absolutely n-!&quot; Cerby began to object before Erby clamped her muzzle shut again. &quot;I mean... I&#39;m still horny enough that it&#39;s not a dealbreaker, but you came out real weird. Like if you were horizontal we could make out face to face a bit before you headed around back to mount us...&quot; She was plainly picturing it and sharing the thoughts with her &quot;sisters&quot; from their respective looks of fear and anticipation. &quot;... well maybe if you all turned sideways... but no then I&#39;m stuck making out with a goat, no offense, and... argh I&#39;m too horny to think and plenty warmed up! Let&#39;s just screw like wild animals in the street already!&quot; Erus grinned and nodded in quite enthusiastic agreement.<br />
<br />
Erby lowered herself down raising their collective rear while Erus eagerly felt herself up and Cerby was in a mild panic, sputtering muffled objections, and alternating between trying to slap Erby&#39;s arm away from her face and using her phone trying to pull up that damned cursed story and work out a way out of this.<br />
<br />
Their male counterparts were still a bit confused by all this, but staring at the naked breasts on this strange beast before them went pretty far to keep them from thinking too hard. Each took a turn brushing fingers along the rim of a nipple, the curve of a hip (or was it more like a shoulder?) or running through a girl&#39;s hair as they moved around behind them and reared up to properly mount the cerberustaur. All three of the girls grunted a little as they hadn&#39;t really considered how they&#39;d be supporting the weight of something like five people totalling these fractions up, but once that leonine member was slamming into them, and Khim was working back and forth being sure to roughly grab each breast and softly bight each neck, the three were just whimpering howling panting and moaning, sometimes even in perfect unison and far beyond caring about the logistics of this strange encounter.<br />
<br />
Eric and Imae meanwhile were at a bit of a loss of what to do with themselves. At first Imae figured the thing to do was just feel up the torso in front of his, but that was Khim&#39;s, and while they may have had a shared body and sensations the &quot;bro code&quot; they&#39;d always followed had them worried that might be a bit gay. Eric was a bit distracted by all the fun stuff happening behind him and backwards, but eventually worked out that he could bend down and slap the collective ass of his partner(s), which gave Imae the idea eventually to try and lean over and see if there were any nipples on that lower dog torso he could maybe run a finger along, or at least some nice fur to pet.<br />
<br />
Eventually everyone reached a simultaneous climax, crying out in decidedly inhuman voices and collapsing in a panting heap. This of course was enough to draw more attention, in the form of two women staggering out of a bar arm and arm and turning a corner to suddenly be face to face with Eric, who didn&#39;t miss a beat in saying &quot;hey there, ladiesss!&quot; Of course, as the rest of the chimera was backing up and dismounting, the sudden jolt caused him to cough right in their faces, spreading the virus even further.<br />
<br />
One stood where she was screaming at what really was a hard sight to take in for someone who hadn&#39;t already seen a lot of weird magical transformations, while the other ran back to get help, She tripped of course, not far past the corner, which was understandable as her legs were suddenly shrinking away to nothing. Simultaneously, a guy who&#39;d just found a place to park his car and the girl who&#39;d been frozen in fear at first ran over to where she&#39;d fallen on the sidewalk, and all three went down in a heap as their legs were similarly afflicted. Everyone&#39;s legs in this new trio shrank away to nothing as their hips were all pulled together, pants and underwear falling away as they fused together at the waist and started to grow a long serpentine tail with shimmering blue scales. These scales quickly spread upward as well, covering each of their torsos, as the three all slimmed down considerably, becoming much more lithe and flexible. As they struggled to stand on legs they no longer had, it was a bit difficult keeping track of who was who in their tangle of arms and an increasingly lengthy and muscular tail whipping about, but once they worked out how to coordinate themselves and properly rear up, their shared body was that of a huge serpent, easily ten feet long, branching into three nearly identical torsos, still covered with those same vivid blue snake scales, with slender arms, long necks, and broad mouths with forked tongues flicking from each, underneath nearly non-existent noses, captivating slitted yellow eyes, and mops of blue-green hair. The one mammilian feature the Hades virus seemed to think was aesthetically important enough to keep, as neither of the women&#39;s torsos still had breasts, and at that their new shared sex was hidden in a long slit regardless of what it was, leaving it both a mystery whether they were a man or a woman, on top of it being unclear which of the three was a guy when they&#39;d fused.<br />
<br />
Eric was doing his best to explain what happened, with the new recruits introducing themselves as Hyde, Ydra, and Drae. Meanwhile the other guys were working out if they could easily high five each other, and after catching their breath, the girls were finally free from sexual frustration enough to think straight and consider how things were developing. Well, Erby and Erus at least. Cerby was busy having a serious identity crisis after having any lingering male self image railed out of her and not wanting to admit how much she enjoyed it, and was just constantly trying to refresh her phone as an attempted update to CYOC kept failing to go through as she forgot the curse of the storyteller forbade her from just changing herself without input from someone else.<br />
<br />
Looking over at the sort-of-hydra Erus was waving hello to, Erby asked, &quot;this is sort of a hyper-specific virus isn&#39;t it? That&#39;s three for three on making multi-headed monsters from Greek mythology and like... are there even any more? Like I guess I don&#39;t mind helping turn a whole city into freaks, that seems kinda fun even but like... the pattern can&#39;t hold right? Also should we maybe like, find whoever wrote this virus and work out what their deal is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cerby looked up from shock for a moment and pointed at the page on her phone. &quot;Well, Erus wrote it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Erby through her arms up. &quot;Well you know what I mean! Who created this virus in the context of real life, not who&#39;s technically responsible for it existing thanks to some weird internet curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erus added, &quot;hey if we&#39;re going to be getting all serious can we go inside somewhere? I don&#39;t like laying on the sidewalk and it&#39;d be nice to get a drink or something.&quot;</p>
