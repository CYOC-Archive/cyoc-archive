<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad woke up with his thighs in his face.  He was bent in half with head and feet in the air between a dresser and a wall. He pushed the heavy dresser away with his muscular legs.  He used his hands to push his butt off the ground and rub his sore lower back.  He felt like he&#39;d just woken up after a killer workout or a big game where he&#39;d been tackled a hundred times.  He rubbed his neck.  He felt so empty, so hungry, so alone.  He needed something, he needed - he wasn&#39;t sure what he needed.  First, he needed to get out of this stinky closet.<br />
<br />
The chest of drawers was eschewed, and he walked out from behind it, and slipped out the closet jar which was ajar.  His feet waded through dirty clothing on the floor.  He was naked, and sort of felt hungover. He didn&#39;t know where he was, he just had to pee really badly.  The cobwebs started lifting from his head, as he looked around the messy room.  There were trophies on the shelves and certificates on the walls.  He stared.<br />
<br />
He was in Bruno&#39;s College Dorm room?  The nearest certificate was from an Inter Collegiate Swim Meet and had Bruno&#39;s name on it.  The year was wrong too, it was dated two years after high school.  Almost three years from the date Chad seemed to think was yesterday.   He sniffed his armpit.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gawd, I reek!&quot;  he said aloud.  His jaw felt stiff and strange.  He moved it back and forth, and his voice seemed raspy like it was dried out.  He coughed, and a dead moth carcass wrapped in spiderweb came out in his hand.  He stared at it a moment and wiped it off on the nearby eschewed bedspread.  What had happened?  He stumbled, as if he hadn&#39;t moved his legs in weeks.  Maybe he had an accident, and bumped his head.  Amnesia?   What was he doing in Bruno&#39;s bedroom?  Did they go to the same college?  He couldn&#39;t remember graduation.  He raised a hand to his face again, and felt his beard.  It wasn&#39;t five o&#39;clock shadow it was a thick beard.  He had felt it when he coughed, but thought it was his imagination, and then he&#39;d been so grossed out by the dead bug.  He spotted a towel hanging on a doorknob, and headed there in hopes it was the bathroom.  He glanced out the window, and realized he was in a highrise dorm building, probably the tenth or twentieth floor?  He had covered himself when he saw the window with the blinds up, but realized quickly that no one was near enough to see him naked.  He stumbled into the tiny bathroom.  It had a toilet and a sink, and building map on the back of the door.  He glanced at that, but then he focused on the mirror.  <br />
<br />
Chad stared at his reflection, he looked like he was 25?  He had a thick curly beard, and his sparse chest hairs had grown into a forest that covered his chest and abdomen.  He missed his own boyish good looks.  He washed his face and beard.    There was white crusty gook dried in his beard.  He wondered what he had been eating.  He looked in the medicine chest for an aspirin.  He took two.  Then he noticed the razors, and depilitory creams and waxes.  Right, Bruno shaved his body hair to reduce friction when he swam.  He had done that in high school.  Yesterday?  Where had the intervening years gone?  He rubbed his head, and tried to remember. There was a Speedo hanging on the back of the door that came off in his hand when he reached for the handle.  Chad stared at the map of the building, there was a common shower room three doors down  from the red dot marked here.   He needed a shower and a shave.  But first he needed some clothing. He looked at the Speedo in his hand, it was a little small, but the material was stretchy.  He sniffed it.  It smelled clean - well, clean enough.  He stepped into the yellow Speedo, and as it snapped around his waist enclosing his butt cheeks and manhood, Chad had a flash of memory.<br />
<br />
It was of some big guy screaming as Chad put him on, and that triggered Chad&#39;s memory.  He had collapsed on the Field House floor.  He was flimsy, helpless, and Bruno had appeared barefoot and naked looming over him.  Chad was having trouble focusing.  Bruno stepped inside him, and pulled him up his hairless muscular legs, and - no!<br />
<br />
Chad stared down at the suit stretched around his manhood.  He almost took it off, but it seemed to want to be on him.  It seemed happy.  Chad had been happy, and Bruno had fed him.  There was a curse.  Something about a curse.  Chad sat down on the nearest bed, and put his head in his hands as he tried to remember, tried to figure out what-<br />
<br />
He remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, Chad, disappointed that I&#39;m not a hot chick? Well, your loss then.  You make a fine damn Speedo, maybe you&#39;re a little peckish?&quot; Bruno had asked, as he started massaging his cock through Chad.  It was growing larger.  Chad was mentally screaming in horror.  It went on forever. Then Bruno came, and Chad was in heaven.  It was better than the best liquor or weed combined.  Chad zoned out, stoned from absorbing Bruno&#39;s cum.  Bruno laughed, and headed to swim practice.<br />
<br />
Chad shook his head.  The suit he was wearing seemed to rub up and down against his cock.  The guy was hungry.  &quot;Feed me,&quot; the suit seemed to say.  Chad&#39;s hand drifted toward his crotch, and suddenly, he remembered Bruno&#39;s bedroom - not this bedroom, but his one at his parents&#39; house. One day or night, Bruno was lying in his bed wearing Chad and playing with himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you don&#39;t get it do you?  Well, I admit there&#39;s not a lot of room for brains in a Speedo, so that&#39;s part of it.  You want to be human, but you want me to cum.  You cannot have both.  Damn, I&#39;ve been jacking in you at least twice a day, since I cursed you. You need a load of cum a day, even your own cum will do it to keep you as a Speedo. I&#39;m off to college next month, and unfortunately, their team Speedos are all yellow, so you won&#39;t get as much use.&quot;  Bruno had paused thoughtfully, or maybe because he was about to blow his load, and was trying to suppress it until he finished speaking.  Chad wouldn&#39;t be listening after he came.  Bruno pulled Chad off him and down his legs. His hard cock sprang up, and his tension seemed to relax. He held Chad up to his face.  Chad felt so empty, and alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, Chad, I&#39;d only mean to screw with you for that weekend.  A load a day to keep your human form away, and let you change back on Monday, but wearing you made me so horny.  Damn, I must&#39;ve blown twenty loads in you by Monday morning. You were stuck as a Speedo for a least 20 days.  I couldn&#39;t afford to- well, never mind.  I&#39;ve worn you every day, pretty much 24/7 ever since, but that&#39;s going to end soon. At college, I&#39;ll have to wear the team colors.  Maybe for weekend parties, I can wear you?  I&#39;ll definitely wear you to bed, and jack off in you every morning. Promise!&quot; he crossed his heart, and then used Chad as a cum rag.  He dozed off for a few minutes, as Chad absorbed the rich milky goodness.  Chad felt sick.  He ran back to the bathroom and coughed dry heaves into the toilet.  A dead spider and some more spider web came out.  He pulled the Speedo down he was wearing to his ankles.  He was sure he heard it sigh.  He shook his head and sat on the toilet.  He pushed.  He was constipated.  It seemed like ages since he&#39;d - aah!   He got up and stared at the white mucousy goo floating in the toilet.  He pursed his lips and flushed.   He grabbed a small towel, and loaded it with supplies from the medicine chest.<br />
<br />
Bruno had said another time holding his suit, &quot;Sorry, Chad, I got a hot date, but so no cum for you today, but I think you&#39;ve had enough loads to keep you a Speedo forever.  If not, and you change back?  Who&#39;d believe you?  And you&#39;re such a horn dog, you&#39;d probably jack off right away, and turn back into a Speedo.  That&#39;s the curse a load of cum changes you into a Speedo for a day.  Oh, crap, he&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad remembered he was in Bruno&#39;s dorm room, and Bruno threw him into the closet.  He landed on the top of the dresser and skidded across the top and fell behind.  Damn, that must&#39;ve been a year ago.<br />
<br />
The suit around his ankles said, &quot;Probably two or three.  I think I was Bruno&#39;s date.  We had a bad-breakup, but he likes the way I fit.  Or he did,&quot; it seemed to sigh.  Chad pulled the Speedo off, and stared at it, &quot;Sorry, dude. If you&#39;re for real and not my imagination.  I need to think, and I really need a shower.  He wrapped the Speedo in the towel with the razor, extra blades, soap and deodorant.    He didn&#39;t know when Bruno would be back.  He rummaged through the dresser and found some extra large sweat pants and a hoodie.  They were grey with yellow writing.  College initials.  He doubted they were Bruno&#39;s unless they were a gift.  Chad wrapped a towel around his waist, and reached for the bedroom door.  He checked the knob.  It was self-locking. He could prop the door open, but someone might close it. Then he saw the single key on the ring hanging on the thumb tack on the bulletin board next to the door. He tried it in the outside lock.  It worked.  Chad slipped the key ring around his finger.  It had a rubber dolphin hanging from the ring too.   Chad looked at the dry erase board taped to the outside of the board.  Bruno had written on it, &quot;AT MEET ALL WEEKEND, BACK MONDAY @ 10AM&quot;. Chad hoped it was still the weekend.<br />
<br />
He plodded down the empty hallway toward the shower room. He could hear music blaring from behind some of the closed doors.  He found the shower room empty too.  He wondered what time it was.  It was daylight outside, maybe just past dawn?  He shrugged.  He found a shower stall, and went inside.  There was a bench for his towel and stuff, hooks for his clothes.  He took out the scissors and began snipping off the long beard hairs...</p>
