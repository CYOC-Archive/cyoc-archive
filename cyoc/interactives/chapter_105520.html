<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Based on a series of stories I wrote on tumblr)<br />
<br />
The compound was a strange place as it wasn&#39;t there and then suddenly it was. It wasn&#39;t public knowledge for the most part although there was a conspiracy going around that it was at least partially government funded. It was a facility where boys of any age from 10-18 were sent to be...changed. Sometimes even older guys into their 20s and 30s found themselves there.<br />
<br />
 In some cases they were sent by their own parents, by their school, a school coach or gym teacher, and sometimes just straight up kidnapped off the streets without provocation. The compound was used to make new Jocks. The actual process was more complicated then that and of course they call it &quot;brightening the athletic future of the United States&quot; but buy and large in meant jocks, plain and simple. If you told the authorities they either wouldn&#39;t believe you or were agents of it and helped to get you trapped faster, or to cover it up. People who tried to send letters and messages to governors, senators, and even the President, we&#39;re all ignored as being nonsense. People wondered though if there wasn&#39;t some secret law protecting the compound. <br />
<br />
The compound itself was run by a mysterious figure called &quot;the coach&quot; who was rarely seen by the &quot;clients&quot; as the prisoners were often called. He only appeared in situations where an individual was very resistant to treatment and needed some special one on one program. Otherwise he stayed in the shadows of his office, seen in person by only the highly ranked employees, all the others spoke to him via walkie. <br />
<br />
The compound had a dormitory area as well as classrooms, cafeterias and gyms and weight rooms all over it. It had outside courtyard areas that mimicked everything from basketball courts and baseball fields to giant swimming pools and even an artificial beach for those on the surfer jock programs. The program you were in determined what you would become and was treated like a major in college. There were certain things everyone had to do and certain things that were program specific. <br />
<br />
The process itself was a combination of drugs, brainwashing, classroom study and activities, subliminal messages in music playing in the workout areas, and peer influence from those further along in the changes. The information a client could access from the outside was entirely controlled. Only sports and sports news TV and radio stations got through. They could only play sports themed video games. They could only read sports related news or magazines, with the exception of porn style magazines directed at both straight and gay audiences. Straight to be the stereotype jock, but sometimes gay was used as a motivator to keep team members close. The process could take anywhere from a week to a few months to be successful. With some giving in right away and unconsciously helping to persuade the others. And some so resistant that if they showed literally no mental change by the one month mark, coach would have to step in directly. <br />
<br />
The compound also on rare occasions offered age regression and progression upon request from families. Some wanting their kids to grow up again from 9 or 10 years old as a jock and get the full &quot;popular kid&quot; experience. Others wanting their high school student to get started on their college or professional sports careers faster. However these were only offered to those who&#39;s families were directly involved with the clients enrollment. For the most part a person stayed the same age. The age regression was also used on those kidnapped in their late 20s or all 30s, due to their age being closer to sportsmen retirement age. <br />
<br />
Sports included baseball, football, wrestling, basketball, hockey, track, and on rare occasions surfing, skating, parcor, and even Olympic jocks were created there. Other sports can also be done upon special requests but those too were uncommon. <br />
<br />
The compounds property wasn&#39;t fenced in but was surrounded by woods on all sides. No one could tell exactly where it was but the employees all stated they were roughly 100 miles from the nearest town. Still escapes were almost impossible as those further along in the program would be more than willing to report any plans of escape they over hear. And there are sensors and cameras all over the woods to spot anyone who did get away, then the guards would track them down. And then even if they somehow managed to get to town all outside agents who worked undercover would be told. With many of them hidden in the police force and government offices, places escapees were most likely to seek out for help. Even if you managed to get away from all that, there was still the chance the mental conditioning could be delayed in its triggering and you simply finish your change outside of the compound. It seemed so hopeless to escape but people tried it anyway, convinced they&#39;d be the first to pull it off successfully. <br />
<br />
Upon finishing the clients go into middle school, high school, college, or professional sports. Sometimes joining Olympic teams or extreme sports going solo. Some become famous others fade into the background but still had their chance at stardom. They would become coaches or gym employees when their hayday was done. And some would go back to work at the compound and help repeat the cycle. And many, regardless of age would help be outside agents to find new recruits.<br />
