<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yes it will,&quot; Amy said to her younger brothers.<br />
<br />
She was glad they felt confident about things and even eager. She did remember having some excitement and anticipation for her own first transformation, but that had also been with the expectation that that wouldn&#39;t occur until she was fourteen.  The fact that her first transformation came a year early was a surprise and had fueled a great deal of concern for Jay and Leon, as a natural born were&#39;s first transformation was usually at fourteen, not thirteen. Thus there really wasn&#39;t anyone that would help in a case where that transformation comes a year early. It was something that Amy and her parents had both feared would happen with Jay and Leon, because the &quot;Moon Lake way&quot; of helping new weres through their first transformation wouldn&#39;t work easily with Jay and Leon.<br />
<br />
It was why Amy had trusted Tad with that information, as while Tad may have had his first transformation at fourteen which was normal, the fact that Tad had grown up outside Moon Lake meant that he had gone through what she had gone through and what Jay and Leon would go through. He had his first transformation without having sex with a more experienced were. And both Tad and his mother had offered to help the Howlers with Jay and Leon&#39;s first transformation. Amy took that as a victory as it would give her brothers a chance to get through their first transformation without difficulty or problems. And her brothers being optimistic about that was good news to Amy. The bigger thing that was in the back of Amy&#39;s mind was that these two looked good and unharmed, which was a relief, given what Tad had overheard at school at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; came her mother&#39;s voice as she came around a corner to greet Amy in the living room. Elizabeth Howler looked to her two sons and gave something of a smile as she walked toward Amy, &quot;The Deckers have been most helpful in helping us get things ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Tad?&quot; Amy asked to her mother.<br />
<br />
Amy and her mother had a short &quot;welcome home hug&quot; before Elizabeth answered her daughter. In fact Amy had pulled away to sit down on the couch before her mother actually spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure your boyfriend&#39;s ideas will help both Jay and Leon... I was referring more to his mother,&quot; Elizabeth commented, &quot;she may be a werecat, but even her first transformation wasn&#39;t necessarily that different from what most weres go through...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she probably did help talk Tad through his first transformation,&quot; Amy commented, her mind drifting to Tad Decker for a moment.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth nodded in response to that, &quot;Agreed. And it was that sort of thing that she and I dealt with today. That way if all this tension over what happened in Seattle... or the Jenkins/Harper wedding that the Skulk is practically in arms over... is still going on, we can talk Jay and Leon through it without having to be worried over newly grown claws doing damage to the rugs or floors if they have to be inside for their first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Amy pause for a moment as it reminded her of the run in she and Tad had had with Dymixious after school and Tad&#39;s suspicions. The attention the Skulk was giving the Jenkins/Harper wedding really didn&#39;t affect Amy all that much. She had a couple of friends that were Skulk members, and to them it was important in general sense, but even they had told Amy that they didn&#39;t know either party closely enough to have gained invitations to the wedding. From the standard rumor mill, Amy figured it was big for the Skulk, but she could also easily say that that wedding was not important to were&#39;s secrecy on the whole. That was where the situation with Dymixious and what happened in Seattle became even more of a potential problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amy... are you okay, dear?&quot; Elizabeth asked to her daughter, noting Amy&#39;s eyes widen and her lips pulled slightly taught after she&#39;d spoken. Jay and Leon also both looked to their sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I&#39;m fine,&quot; Amy said after a moment, &quot;It&#39;s just that something you said reminded me of something that happened today...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it relate to all the sirens?&quot; Jay asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sirens?&quot; Elizabeth asked to her son, trading glances between Jay and Leon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Police sirens went by the Middle School this morning,&quot; Jay answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were chasing a bad guy,&quot; Leon added.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth shrugged and nodded. If this bad guy didn&#39;t go into the school, it could have just been a coincidence that he was in the same area as the school. And since Jay and Leon both looked okay to her, Elizabeth was willing to assume that there was no danger to the school. Amy sort of nodded. She didn&#39;t know for sure what had gone on near the Middle School, but since Jay and Leon were alright there wasn&#39;t much she could really say about that at the moment. Besides, her greatest concern was with Dymixious, who she and Tad had run into earlier in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it wasn&#39;t sirens,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;More in relation to what had happened in Seattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
From there Amy explained running into Dymixious with Tad, Dymixious&#39;s extreme overreaction to an accident, the man&#39;s arrogant boasting, and stating things that made it quite possible that Dymixious was responsible for the death of Lionel Ulysses. She ultimately finished with the report of this to Jen Decker and then to police. To say that Elizabeth Howler was surprised and even a bit fearful was something of an understatement.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this man isn&#39;t hunting anyone in Moon Lake?&quot; Elizabeth said to Amy with as much control as she could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think he is,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;from what the police officer told is is that they want to keep things quiet until after the weekend in the hopes that when Dymixious is caught and picks his fight... it won&#39;t be detrimental to Moon Lake. As they know he&#39;ll likely fight if targeted by law enforcement...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would be something Moon Lake can&#39;t afford right now,&quot; Elizabeth gave a sigh, &quot;all thanks to a dumb lizard...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay and Leon joined Amy in nodding in agreement. They were glad that this guy didn&#39;t attack their sister or her boyfriend. They could accept Tad a relatively decent guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you and Tad were smart to do what you did,&quot; Elizabeth spoke, &quot;and just do your best to keep your distance from the man. If he&#39;s really that violent... I don&#39;t want him going off on you. Beyond that, we&#39;ll have to hope that this guys follows our laws and rules...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded.</p>
