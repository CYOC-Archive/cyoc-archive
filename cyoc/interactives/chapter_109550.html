<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; the gray wolf behind Sean&#39;s Father finally spoke up, &quot;I&#39;m going back downstairs. We still have company.&quot; This break in silence snaps the two males out of their odd stupor of sexual thoughts and stunned response to the developments of the room. Dejectedly, the brown wolf throws up her pawed-hands in defeat and follows the gray wolf out of the room. The sound of claws can be heard clacking against hardwood floor as the only remaining she-wolf leans out of the door and watches them go down the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that you two.&quot; the formerly male wolf-morph says as she turns her head to face the other two, &quot;It&#39;s been quite a night for her. Not only that, all the girls are a little hot and bothered for some reason, and everyone is just trying to keep it civil.&quot; The gray wolf begins to slowly walk through the doorway, still craning her head back at the two boys. &quot; Jeff, you can either go with your parents in a few minutes,&quot; she pauses, &quot;or you can stay the night. Just, please, stay up here with Sean.&quot; She flashes an odd smile at the boys and walks out of the room, leaving the two remaining lupine men to themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;That,&quot; begins Sean,  &quot;That was my father?&quot; He was still staring at the doorway. By the slight erection he still had,  It was pretty obvious how conflicted he was. Even though two of them were his parents, seeing the naked bodies of three well-endowed she-wolves definitely affected his libido. However, for Jeff, something didn&#39;t sit right with him. The things Sean&#39;s parents spoke about really interested him.  Several thoughts run through his head, analyzing Sean&#39;s fathers apology about how &#39;hot and bothered&#39; they were, as well as remembering that Sean&#39;s family was hosting when he entered the picture. He finally moves to look at the Chronovac program. Sean&#39;s ears perk up as he watches Jeff move swiftly to his computer and sit down. He wags his tail, as his thoughts continually drift to the she-wolves from earlier, despite his attempts to distract himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Sean speaks meekly, &quot;Why&#39;d you turn my father into a bitch?&quot; With no response, he turns his hulking wolf frame around, only to find Jeff typing away on his computer. Annoyed, Sean lumbers over to him. Jeff stops typing and eyes the screen with intensity. Sean looks where Jeff is staring, but doesn&#39;t find what he&#39;s looking at. Luckily, Jeff silently places one claw against the screen, onto the critical piece of information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look dude.&quot; He finally says. He indicates to a field of text. The string of text is short and simple. &#39;Total transformations: 9&#39;.  Sean doesn&#39;t catch the implication at first, but then his amber eyes go wide. Including himself, Jeff,  Jeff&#39;s mom, and his own parents only amount to five. Both males look at each other in silence. Quietly, Jeff stands up from the computer chair and motions Sean to follow him out of his room. They practically clamor down the stairs, trying to keep their clacking feet from giving away their position. They stop at the doorway to the living room, where the sound of chatter and sharp, clacking teeth can be heard. On each side of the door-frame, they look into the room. To their surprise, they see the three wolves from before, but not only them. In the room, two gray wolves sit in two individual chairs; not one, but two brown wolves sit on one couch; finally, three white wolves inhabit the remaining couch. Moreover, they are all clearly and undeniably female. The white wolves, all sitting together, are surprisingly petite, compared to the other wolves. However, each still supports two pairs of breasts ranging from between a C and D cup. The other brown wolf was the brawniest of all the other wolves, with a large frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, that&#39;s right.&quot; Sean says, going through the same revelation that Jeff went through up stairs. &quot;My parents were having company over. Those wolves must be the Robbins.&quot;  Jeff cocks his head at him, which he responds by simply pointing at the three white furred wolves on the couch. Jeff returns his gaze and eyes them carefully. Their bodies are lean yet curvy, with ample child-bearing hips. Each wolf sits with long legs and thick, fluffy, white tails. Other than that, their doesn&#39;t waft outwards like the other wolves, but lays tightly against their body, leaving their genitalia completely exposed to any who decide to look. Jeff doesn&#39;t waste the opportunity, and the sight leaves a stirring in his groin. He decides to distract himself, and looks somewhere else in the room. His eyes immediately land on the other brown wolf next to his mother, and his eyes go wide. Her body is absolutely stunning, amazonian in its proportions. Her posture indicates that she may be the same height as Jeff and Sean. Her large body does not go  unaccompanied by ample breasts, which sit at amazing G-cups followed by D-cups right below. If she didn&#39;t have such a large frame, a pair of that size that would look absurd. The lupine had every other talking wolf beat when it came to size. Unfortunately for Jeff, her entire form did nothing to distract him from the heat coming from his crotch.  Sean looks where Jeff is looking and snickers, which causes Jeff to look at him in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;That other wolf must be your dad. Boy, he sure rose to meet it!&quot; Sean says this with a wolfish grin, and Jeff&#39;s own wolfish face turns red in response. It&#39;s blatantly obvious to him now that the amazonian looking bitch was his father. With her brown-colored fur, she must&#39;ve been with his mother when they came with concerns about theft. Sean laughs at Jeff and his reaction. His face turns just as red at his friends utter embarrassment of getting a stiffy for his own father. Jeff snarls at him, red faced still, and moves to shove him. Instead of shoving him however, his claws extend by accident and they nick Sean in the side. It&#39;s barely enough to draw a drop of blood, but Sean&#39;s new self-defense instincts kick in and he retaliates immediately. Jeff yips in surprise as Sean tackles him, sending them both through the doorway into the living room.<br />
<br />
As they hit the floor, the idle conversation of the room stops immediately. Each wolf-woman cranes her neck and swivels her ears to discern the location of the loud crashing. Their presence clearly no longer hidden, the  two wolf-men slowly stand up, towering over all but one of the other wolf-morphs.Sean sheepishly eyes his father. Expecting an angry stare, instead he&#39;s greeted with a look of surprise and embarrassment. Her lupine face is as red as Jeff&#39;s was. He can&#39;t help but notice that her tits are still erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean!&quot; the gray wolf barks, &quot;I told you to stay upstairs! You know why you have to stay up stairs!&quot; At Both Jeff&#39;s and Sean&#39;s confused expression, the she let&#39;s out a whine and stands up. Before she can assert herself, a wolf behind her speaks up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Carl, you didn&#39;t tell me how much of a stud your pup had become!&quot; Sean&#39;s father wheels around at the response. It was the left-most white-wolf, Mr. Robbins. She stood up, and began to walk towards the boys. Sean&#39;s father elicits a growl in her direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark! Control yourself!&quot; The white wolf completely disregards the command of Sean&#39;s father, and continues walking towards the two virile males. She plants herself in front of Sean, who looks down on her with a questioning face. She places both her pawed-hands on his torso and traces the six-pack underneath his gray fur with a single claw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, enjoy the situation.&quot; Is all she says, as if to command Sean and his father at the same time. She then proceeds to grope Sean&#39;s body, admiring it in all its male form. His father blushes and shifts her body weight. Her authority has been snuffed, and she&#39;s obviously upset at where the situation is quickly heading. For some reason however, she is unwilling-- or perhaps unable, to reassert her dominance over the other wolf-father bitch.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Sean then let&#39;s out an audible gasp. The white-wolf&#39;s pawed-hand is firmly pressed against Sean&#39;s sheath. Unable to control himself, his member springs to life in her grasp. It&#39;s appearance causes an immediate effect on the room. The other female wolves quickly shift their gaze to Sean&#39;s penis. The sound of natural breathing ceases in the room.<br />
<br />
  The silence is unnaturally energetic. Aware of her control, the white wolf looks up at the gray male and kisses Sean&#39;s muzzle, which he responds by turning as red as his penis. All the other wolves silently watch this exchange. By this point, Sean&#39;s member stood proud at seven inches, slowly pulsing in front of all the wolf ladies. Satisfied, she smiles at him and pulls her hand and herself from him, making him involuntarily whimper in desire.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Cassie&#39;s boy.&quot; She gives a toothy grin as she looks at Jeff. She saunters over to him, while eying Jeff&#39;s parents, who are in turn eying Sean&#39;s dick. She scoffs and leans into Jeff, tracing his penis while it&#39;s still in his shaft. Jeff gasps at her forwardness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark!&quot; Sean&#39;s father whines again, weaker than before. In no sense of composure to make demands, her voice is more pleading, as if begging Mr. Robbins to stop. She&#39;s well past the point of return and is slowly succumbing to the energy of the room. She unconsciously rubs her thighs together as she stands there and whines at Mr. Robbins.<br />
<br />
As his heart pumps thick blood from the stimulation, Jeff instinctively takes a deep sniff and is greeted with a smell that is both amazing and arousing. Jeff turns his nose across the room, and the smell grows stronger every time he points his snout at another wolf, even Sean. It&#39;s enough to give him a rise, which the white-furred lupine takes advantage of. <br />
<br />
 She continues to tease his groin, and the pleasure leaves him feeling powerless to stop her. As if in rebellion, he looks away from the white wolf and his growing member. His gaze lands on his mother. He could see her blush and cross her legs, with her claws very near her vaginal region in response. Jeff hastily looks away again, only to find more of this around the room. They all respond similarly, with the bitches who were previously men being the least subtle about it. Jeff&#39;s father puts her lupine claws on her massive upper pair of breasts, and squeezes her legs tightly together while blushing. Sean&#39;s father shifts her weight constantly at the hips as Jeff stares. It&#39;s clear she&#39;s kneading her pussy with her thighs, trying to appease her lustiness. The middle white wolf, now the left-most wolf, is perhaps the least bashful, hoisting her perky breasts up with crossed arms. Spreading her legs, she displays her glistening groin to the room. She gives a seductive wink to Jeff, who blushes and returns to the wolf below him.<br />
<br />
Through her pleasuring, he&#39;s just as erect as Sean. The smell and submissive responses of all of the women in the room make it hard for him to think about anything but sex. Through his aroused stupor, Jeff remembers his mother complaining about going into heat. It was an idle comment by her, but he suspects she may be right, and the Chronovac must&#39;ve actually put them all in heat. Mr. Robbins let&#39;s her tongue lull out of her mouth a bit at the sight of Jeff&#39;s throbbing member. He was bigger than Sean, and that seemed to excite her. Jeff can feel the eyes of a few of the other females as well. The white wolf moves in close and holds her body less than a finger&#39;s width away from his cock. Her tail swishes, and she&#39;s starts to shuffle in want the same way Sean&#39;s father is.<br />
<br />
Jeff can practically feel the transition of power go to him. He now holds the will of the slender wolf below him, and by extension, the rest of the females. Barely in control of his own sexual desires and lust to mate, he&#39;s unsure how and if he should assert his dominance.</p>
