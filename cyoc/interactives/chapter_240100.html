<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she watches the two boys, who are currently arguing over a scene in the cartoon they are watching, trying to come up with the perfect “idea” of what to do with the two 10 year old boys, her stomach begins to growl, Kat grins, knowing exactly what she wants to do, as she takes out her wand, while licking her lips.<br />
<br />
Kat had read about a forbidden spell, a spell that allows a witch or wizard to absorb the soul of something living, no matter if it’s a human or animal, to increase their powers, and Kat, in her broken mind, wants nothing more than to be the most powerful and unstoppable witch in the entire universe. The teenage witch, however, knows that since the spell is forbidden, it is strongly monitored by the high table, meaning that once she casts the spell, she’ll send a signal to the authorities, which would ruin her plan. What makes Kat extremely dangerous is that she is extremely smart, mumbling under her breath, Kat casts a spell that will prevent the “beacon” from ever sending a signal, by causing the victim to “willingly” let him- or herself be absorbed, and also at the same time will alter the reality, causing everyone to think that the person she absorbed never existed in the first place.<br />
<br />
The witch’s grin widens when she feels the first spell take affect, ‘with that dealt with,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I can focus on preparing my “meal” in peace.’<br />
<br />
Kat once again mumbles under her breath, casting the forbidden spell, grinning wide when she feels the “beacon” try to send the signal before it simply shatters, her grin widens when she notices the boys bodies glow for a split second, indicating that they are “ready” for the next step.<br />
<br />
Slipping her wand back into her sleeve, Kat speaks up, “boys, let’s play a game,” the boys turn to look at her.<br />
<br />
“What kind of game, Kat,” they ask, their voices filled with curiosity, “we love playing games!”<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “I know you do,” she says, “and I know you especially love playing the game “pretend”, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s our favorite,” the boys say, now sounding excited, “are we going to play a game of pretend?”<br />
<br />
“We sure are,” Kat says.<br />
<br />
“Cool,” the boys say, “so, how will the game look like?”<br />
<br />
“Simple, I’m hungry, so you’ll be “pretending” to be food for me to eat,” Kat says, “you think you can do that for me?”<br />
<br />
The boys look at each other, they can feel that something is not quite right, but instead of listening to their instincts, they simply turn back to look at Kat and say, “we… we could give it a try. We never pretended to be food before… so… um… what do you have in mind, Kat?”<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “I’m thinking of a delicious steak with mashed potatoes,” she says.<br />
<br />
The boys find themselves licking their lips, “sounds delicious,” they say, “okay, let’s give it a try. So, who of us should be the “steak” and who should be the “potatoes”,” they then ask.<br />
<br />
“I was thinking, Ken could be the steak, since his muscles are bigger than Ben’s, which means, Ken would be a very juicy steak,” Kat says.<br />
<br />
The boys look at each other, “yeah, that makes sense,” they say.<br />
<br />
“Good to hear we have an agreement,” Kat says, smiling, “then, my cute little ingredients, let’s head into the kitchen and get you prepared!”<br />
<br />
The boys follow Kat into the kitchen, “okay, Kat, so what’s the first step,” they ask.<br />
<br />
Kat, putting on an apron, turns to look at the boys, “first, food doesn’t wear clothes,” she says, grinning, “so, time for you to strip! And while you do that, I’ll grab the ingredients for the marinade and get to work on that”.<br />
<br />
“By the way, Kat,” Ken says as he and Ben start stripping without caring, “what type of “steak” am I pretending to be?”<br />
<br />
“A top sirloin,” Kat says as she begins gathering the ingredients for the marinade.<br />
<br />
Ken tilts his head, “a top sirloin,” he asks, “aren’t those thick steaks?”<br />
<br />
Kat turns around and smiles at the naked 10-year-old, “yup, the thicker the juicer,” she says.<br />
<br />
“But, I read that a steak that thick needs to sit in marinade for at least eight hours,” Ken says, frowning, “I thought you wanted to eat us, like… in an hour or so?”<br />
<br />
Kat chuckles at the innocence of her “steak”, “true, but don’t worry, I have a way to speed up the process,” she says, “so don’t you worry, you’ll be eaten soon!”<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “that’s a relief,” he says, “I don’t want you to starve, Kat!”<br />
<br />
“Aaaw, you are such a sweety,” she says, “by the way, food doesn’t have hair, so your hairs will retreat into your bodies”.<br />
<br />
The boys giggle a little as they feel all their body hairs retreat back into their bodies.<br />
<br />
Working quickly, Kat places the ingredients for the marinade, which consists of: olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, basil, garlic powder, parsley, white pepper and minced garlic into a blender, turning on to high speed to get the ingredients blended together, after 30 seconds all ingredients are thoroughly combined.<br />
<br />
Kat turns to Ken, smiling, “your marinade is finished,” she says, “now to attend to you, my little steak,” she says. Thanks to the spell she had cast, Kat only needs to say what change she wants and doesn’t need her wand to change the boy, “you are a little to big, so you need to shrink down to 1,75 inches, and weigh no more than 10 ounces”.<br />
<br />
Ken’s eyes widen in surprise as he feels himself shrink, “w-whoa, this is the most realistic game of pretend I have ever played,” he says, sounding more fascinated than horrified.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, grabbing a plastic bag with a seal and pours the marinade into the bag, looking back her smile turns into a grin when she sees Ken has shrunken down to the size of an average top sirloin steak.<br />
<br />
“Much better,” Kat says, kneeling down and carefully picking the shrunken boy up, “time for you to be marinaded,” she says, before dropping the boy into the plastic bag.<br />
<br />
Ken yelps as he lands in the cold marinade, “it… it’s cold,” he says, looking up.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “don’t worry,” she says, “you’ll enjoy being cooked so much more. I’ll be sealing the bag now, but don’t worry, you’ll be still able to breath”. The witch seals the bag, squeezing out excess air, then opens the fridge and carefully places the bag with the shrunken boy into the fridge, “give it two hours and you’ll be ready for cooking,” she says, chuckling when Ken gives her a thumbs-up, before shutting the door.<br />
<br />
The witch then turns to Ben, “now, my little potato, it’s your turn,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Finally,” Ben says, sounding a little impatient.<br />
<br />
Kat chuckles, taking out a large pot and setting it on the floor, “since your body is made up of pealed potatoes, I want THEM to fill this pot,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Ben says, before his body suddenly seems to dissolve, starting with his head, Kat watches as potatoes, one by one, fall from the boy and into the pot, until the pot is filled to the brim with freshly pealed potatoes.<br />
<br />
Kat grins, picking up the pot of potatoes and setting it on the stove, she then grabs the kettle and heats up water before adding the boiling water to the potatoes, turning on the stove, the witch then leans against the counter, taking out her phone and begins chatting with a friend, as if she was cooking a meal with real potatoes.<br />
<br />
As Kat begins cooking and mashing the potatoes, that once had been Ben, the former human boy feels nothing but pleasure, mentally moaning, ‘I hope… being eaten will feel just as good… if not… better,’ he thinks to himself, mentally smiling, feeling at ease, calm and oh so relaxed.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes the potatoes are cooked enough and Kat removes the pot from the stove, pouring the water into the sink. Kat then walks to the fridge and takes out a bottle of milk, she then pours some milk into the pot with the cooked potatoes, before grabbing a stainless steal potato masher, and begins to mash up the potatoes, adding salt and pepper to give it flavor.<br />
<br />
Kat takes a spoon out of a drawer and scoops up some of the mashed potato, a huge smile appears on her face as she eats the first spoon, “delicious,” she says, “now all we need is to wait for the steak to be ready for cooking,” with a happy smile, Kat heads into the living room and turns on the TV, starting to watch her favorite series, which, of course, includes witches.<br />
<br />
While Kat is peacefully watching her series, Ben and Ken are becoming impatient, ‘maaaaaan, when is she finally going to cook me,’ Ken thinks to himself, ‘I feel like the marinade is completely absorbed into me! Boy… I hope I taste good!’<br />
<br />
‘This is so boooooring,’ Ben thinks to himself, ‘just sitting in this silly pot! I wanna be eaten already!’<br />
<br />
Finally after almost three hours, Kat decides it’s about time to finish cooking her meal and finally eat, ‘I’m starving, Ken should be fully marinaded by now,’ she thinks to herself as she heads back into the kitchen and straight for the fridge. The witch smiles as she opens the door, “hey my little steak, sorry for keeping you waiting,” she says, picking up the plastic bag and carrying it over to the stove.<br />
<br />
“About time, I was starting to get impatient,” Ken grumbles, his arms crossed.<br />
<br />
Kat chuckles, “don’t worry, you’ll be sizzling in the pan in a second,” she says, placing a pan on the stove and pouring some oil into it. Once the pan and oil are hot enough, Kat opens the bag and pulls Ken out, “what do you think about your brother? Doesn’t he look great as mashed potatoes?”<br />
<br />
“Damn, he looks absolutely delicious,” Ken says.<br />
<br />
“And he is,” Kat chuckles, “alright, into the pan with you,” she says and places Ken into the steaming pan, lying him on his back, the boy letting out a gasping moan, his cock erecting.<br />
<br />
“F-fuck… this… this feels so damn good,” he says in a blissful tone.<br />
<br />
Kat grins, her mouth watering as the smell of the sizzling boy fills her nose, “damn, you smell amazing,” she says, flipping the boy over, his moans muffled as he is turned onto his front.<br />
<br />
After five minutes Kat takes Ken out of the pan, placing him on a plate, grinning down at him. Ken’s body is covered in a thick crust of marinade, perfectly cooked, “I can’t wait to get my teeth into you, Ken,” Kat says, “I just need to heat up the mashed potatoes”.<br />
<br />
“I feel so happy,” Ken says, “it’s so weird, the thought of being eaten excites me and makes me happy, to know that I’ll satisfy your hunger!”<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “then let’s not waste anymore time,” she says, and after heating up the mashed potatoes, the young witch sits down at the table and starts eating, moaning at the taste, “oh damn, you both taste so delicious,” she says, “you are the best I have ever eaten!”<br />
<br />
Ken moans in pleasure as Kat cuts pieces off of his body, before plopping the parts into her mouth, slowly chewing, before swallowing it.<br />
<br />
“It feels so good,” Ken says, “I never… felt so good in my life!”<br />
<br />
Kat chuckles, already feeling her powers increase as her body begins to digest the former boys, absorbing their young and pure energies into her body, merging the boys energies with her own, soon Kat has eaten every last piece of the former boys, leaning back in her chair and patting her round full tummy, grinning evilly to herself.<br />
<br />
“Hehe, once your energies have been fully absorbed by me, I won’t be needing a stupid wand to cast spells,” she says to herself, knowing that the boys no longer can hear her, their minds clouded by the immense pleasure of being digested.<br />
<br />
Kat cackles, getting to her feet and leaving the house, the reality shifting as the world forgets about Ben and Ken ever existing, “that was great, a good start to increase my power, but I need more! Hehe… I think I should visit one of Dan’s friends next… maybe even his girlfriend! Hehe… she’ll make a fine family meal!”</p>
