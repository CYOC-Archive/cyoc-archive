<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess returned to a different section of library area to keep putting together the vaccine that would keep any human that hadn&#39;t contract the Chakat Virus remain human. Sally did have a great idea in terms of protecting the human population. While the Chakat Virus MIGHT remove a lot of the negative aspects of human society, given a Kat&#39;s instincts to love, but the forced conversions took free will out the equation and wouldn&#39;t entirely make things completely better. Maurice and Snowy managed to escape jail time for unleashing the Chakat Virus on Fee City, and there were those that became Kats that actually did thank them, but there were also a lot of Kats that were very resentful of Maurice and Snowy for not giving them a choice. That was partially why Maurice and Snowy chose Jess and Nikole as &quot;probation&quot; officers and came with them to Janace Ranch.<br />
<br />
For them, it was a decent escape from the various small outbreaks in America that came about after the outbreak in Fee City, but those were all ultimately solved through the Foxkat Vaccine in getting the lust and infectious parts of the Chakat Virus under control. The outbreak in Paris, though, had changed things with the fact that the virus was now being spread as an airborne virus as well as as an STD. It would mean the virus could spread faster and if the transformation wasn&#39;t instantaneous it carried the great risk of the outbreak going across all of Europe before it could be contained. That was where Sally&#39;s idea for an airborne vaccine would work. It&#39;d spread just as fast and would block the transformations into Kats of any kind. From there, the only way to become a Kat would be on an individual basis and with a specifically doctored version for the individual, the way the virus had been doctored for Jess to become a Foxkat and now for hir father to become a Chakat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think this will work, dear?&quot; Nikole asked as shi looked at the various pieces of scientific equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jess nodded, &quot;the new vaccine will be attached to its own retrovirus that will be airborne. We can then put it into the ventilation systems of various buildings around the world... and of course inform people of what will be done FIRST... and then the vaccine will then spread around the globe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess then attached one container that looked like it was filled with a clear liquid, which was actually the base retrovirus to a device that would actually serve to mix the retrovirus with hir father&#39;s human blood that would form the basis for the vaccine. Shi then began to attach a container that was filled with Justin&#39;s human blood. With the press of a button the device then spun at great speed and mixed blood and the retrovirus The tubes with the retrovirus and the tubes with the blood emptied. When it stopped, Jess lifted up the lid and pulled up a few test tubes that were filled with what looked red, but Nikole and Jess&#39;s eyes both picked up a sort of &quot;swirl&quot; to it. It was probably the result of the mixing, but the swirl did prove that it wasn&#39;t just blood. It was now the vaccine.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s the new vaccine?&quot; Nikole asked as she walked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my dad&#39;s blood... my dad&#39;s human blood is now mixed and attached to the retrovirus and will allow for the mixture.. it&#39;ll then attach the human Type O blood type with the partial D antigens and so if they come in contact with any Chakat Virus strain that isn&#39;t specifically doctored for the individual... the virus will hit that blood type and they won&#39;t be affected,&quot; Jess answered, &quot;and thanks to the computer engineering of the retrovirus it will only attach my dad&#39;s human blood type and antigen level to who takes the new vaccine...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So people won&#39;t all become Type O blood types?&quot; Nikole wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jess nodded, &quot;Technically they&#39;ll still have their own blood type and antigen levels... but they&#39;ll also have the blood type and antigen level attached... or will respond LIKE they&#39;re a Type O with Partial D antigens, depending on how you want to look at it... and the computer tests did respond well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikole looked around the improvised lab and then turned back to Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did they need us again?&quot; Nikole wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;They needed out expertise,&quot; Jess answered, &quot;Snowy and Maurice know more about the Chakat Virus than anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but they&#39;re needing to STOP the Chakat Virus,&quot;Nikole commented, &quot;They have all the equipment needed for the vaccine, and the fact that those with Type O and Partial D antigens are immune to the virus is common knowledge. We revealed that to the FBI in Fee City before some of their agents came in and volunteered to be Foxkats to stop the spread there... in pure theory, the French scientists should have all the information they need to engineer at least the Foxkat vaccine. And I wouldn&#39;t put it past them to ultimately figure out your idea to make an airborne vaccine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you saying...?&quot; Jess asked to Nikole as shi took one of the tubes to another machine that would then mix the vaccine with another set of chemicals that would then allow the vaccine to be used as a gas that would make it airborne. The chemicals weren&#39;t harmful to people, thankfully, but at present, that wasn&#39;t what truly concerned Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m saying that some of this seems rather suspicious,&quot; Nikole commented, &quot;Blocking your cellphone&#39;s signal? They have all the equipment ready and waiting for our arrival? This is all going into some sort of James Bond type level of intrigue that is too big. I mean, Maurice and Snowy just wanted people to love each other. The way they went about it may have been wrong, but their ultimate motivation wasn&#39;t wrong or evil... but the more we uncover here in Paris... the more it seems like there are contingencies and preparations that are far more complex than what happened in Fee City.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess was about to answer when shi heard the sound of screaming come from outside the lab. It actually sounded like one of the scientists. Shi moved to a door and looked out to see the leading scientist being dragged down the stairs by a pair of French soldiers. Another two soldiers had their guns pointed at the scientist, and General Heroud&#39;s &quot;executive officer,&quot; a colonel brought up the rear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vous ne pouvez pas me faire ça!&quot; the scientist screamed in French.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vous avez aidé à libérer le virus, si elle n&#39;est pas de faire tout vous-même! Général Heroud vous tiendra personnellement responsable de tous les citoyens français, nous avons dû tuer pour contrôler cette épidémie!&quot; the colonel growled back, &quot;Vous nous direz tout ce que nous voulons savoir, et alors vous serez jugé pour complot et peut-être la trahison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See,&quot; Nikole said to Jess, &quot;strange intrigues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And just when we got the vaccine ready,&quot; Jess commented, &quot;come on... let&#39;s find out what&#39;s going on...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Justin Cain, meanwhile, made hir way back to the nursery where shi knew that Francine was. Justin loved Francine and knew that hir love would not change, regardless of hir&#39;s or Francine&#39;s form. But, Francine seemed so shocked, surprised, and &quot;broken&quot; by hir transformation, Justin knew that remaining human would only complicate things. He was very willing to give Francine whatever shi wanted to be happy, and from the way he had seen it, that meant becoming a shi... a Chakat.<br />
<br />
Justin made his way back into the nursery and found that things had calmed down a bit. Snowy was now laying on the bed with hir daughter suckling from hir right breast. Foxy, Silky, Pinkie, and Janice had all drifted off to sleep and were cuddled against Snowy&#39;s taur body. Alexis was laying beside hir mother, who was looking a bit better. Flake sat nearby trying to help Alexis wherever shi could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for not hating me for making such a mistake,&quot; Francine said to hir soughter weakly in French.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could never hate you, mother,&quot; Alexis answered, &quot;and as I said before... being a Kat... it isn&#39;t all that bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin watched as Alexis moved hir tail over hir mother&#39;s back and tail, as if shi was brushing Francine&#39;s shorter fur with the longer and fluffier fur that made up Alexis&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m quite thankful to have such a loving daughter,&quot; Francine said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soughter,&quot; Flake corrected, and then realized hir mistake, &quot;Oops...&quot;<br />
<br />
Francine said nothing and sighed. Shi&#39;d heard the line from time to time from the American Chakats and Foxkat. They&#39;d all thoroughly adapted to being hermaphroditic cat taurs and one being a fox taur and had begun to combine words to suit the fact that they had no truly identifiable gender. That made hir think about the penis that was presently soft and in the sheath between hir rear legs. While Francine still had hir breasts and hir vagina, the presence of the sheath and penis underneath hir made it clear that shi no longer had a truly identifiable gender either.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Francine said after a moment, &quot;it&#39;s not like I can go back...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alexis said with a sigh, &quot;We&#39;ll be Kats for the rest of our lives, mother. But it&#39;ll be okay. Flake and I will become mates when all this calms down and we&#39;ll be happy together...&quot;<br />
<br />
A new voice then spoke up. It wasn&#39;t a deep voice of a man and wasn&#39;t entirely the higher pitch of a woman, but somewhere in-between.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ll always be together, Francine,&quot; Justin spoke as shi entered the nursery.<br />
<br />
Francine looked up to see Justin enter. Justin was a Siamese Chakat. Hir body was mostly a grayish/cream color with hir ears, face and muzzle, arms, forelegs, rear legs, and tail a very dark brown, almost black in color. Proportionately speaking, hir ears were the typical size for a house cat and weren&#39;t over-sized the way Francine&#39;s Serval ears were. Justin&#39;s eyes were still a bright shade of blue with the vertical slits of a house cat. Hir fur was short and looked rather soft, particularly on the two B cup breasts on hir chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Justin?&quot; Francine asked as shi got up onto hir four feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me,&quot; Justin answered and came forward, &quot;I told you I&#39;d be a Kat for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francine then rushed forward and hugged him and found hirself purring. Justin hugged hir back and purred as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Francine,&quot; Justin told hir and gave Francine the best kiss their feline muzzles would allow.</p>
