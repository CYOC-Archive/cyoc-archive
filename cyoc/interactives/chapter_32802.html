<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiff watched in horror as her brother ate the fruit. She had wanted to examine them all it turn, and try to figure out what they might do before actually trying anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;That might not have been too good an idea,&quot; Katie commented, stating the obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Luke complained, frustrated with how stupid Katie and his sister were being, &quot;According to you a pink fruit was what made me want to dress like a girl, so a blue fruit must be what reverses it. It makes perfect sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shrugged, &quot;So, do you still want to dress like a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Giving the question some thought, Luke realized that he still liked the idea of looking like a girl and he could hardly wait to get back to his room to try on all of the new feminine clothing he had bought that day. He wanted to wear makeup and look beautiful. As he considered those things he realized that one of the straps of his bra, really the bra he had stolen from his sister, had fallen slightly. Without thinking he adjusted it, provoking a shout of outrage from Tiff.<br />
<br />
&quot;You little creep, you stole my best bra! I thought I had lost it somehow!&quot; Despite the situation, Tiff was still angry at her brother for the theft, especially since he often took her stuff, just to annoy her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, I didn't have any of my own, so I had to take one of yours,&quot; Luke retorted, as though it was perfectly natural that he would wear a bra. He liked the way it felt and all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take it off before you get it all stretched out and messed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; Luke lifted his shirt and threw the bra at his sister, hitting her in the face with it.<br />
<br />
While Luke's shirt was lifted, Katie noticed something, &quot;Umm, Luke are you feeling anything strange?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he snapped, trying to adjust his shirt to make it feel comfortable. He felt naked without a bra and the fabric of his shirt against his chest was terribly uncomfortable. He had no idea how he had put up with the feeling for so long. <br />
<br />
Now Tiff was staring at him as well, making him feel even more naked. They were staring at his chest specifically, making him look down as well. His nipples were visible, poking out against his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are disgusting, staring at me like that you know,&quot; but even as he spoke he realized that there was something very different about his chest. A thrill of excitement ran through him, was it possible? He ran his hands down over his chest and felt twin mounds, somehow he was growing breasts. Now he would have no reason to stuff his bras with socks or tissues when he wore them, he had breasts of his own. As he held his hands against his chest he could feel that they were still growing.<br />
<br />
How big would they get? He had no desire for anything ridiculously huge like some porn star, but he hoped that they would be at least bigger than Katie's.<br />
<br />
Luke smirked at his sister, &quot;Excuse me, I think I need to go and put on one of the bras I bought before running into you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could say anything, he picked up the bags containing the clothing he had bought and went into his room to change.<br />
<br />
Once there he stripped off his shirt and examined his new breasts. By his best guess they were a b-cup, not quite as large as his sister's, but still respectable. They were perfect in every way too, perky and firm. Smiling he put on one of the bras he had bought at the mall, admiring the way his new breasts filled it. With his wide shoulders and muscular torso it was a strange look, but he thought he looked better with breasts than without. Deciding that he was not going to just his old shirt back on he took one of the blouses he had gotten. It had a fairly low neckline, to show off his new breasts.<br />
<br />
While he was at it he decided to put on new pants as well, he had bought his new, feminine wardrobe for a reason after all, and how he had even more of a reason than before.<br />
<br />
Garbed in a totally feminine outfit, and feeling proud of his new breasts he went back into his sister's room, twirling in a circle so that she and Katie could get a good look at his new look.<br />
<br />
Tiff let out a soft moan and Katie fought back giggles.</p>
