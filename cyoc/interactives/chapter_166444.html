<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About another hour had passed since Jen grew her second pair of arms. By now she was completely used to walking on her 4 legs. She looked like some kind of centaur, except instead of half horse, she was half wasp. Just as she was beginning to think her transformations were over, she felt the familiar pain once again, this time on her chest. Looking down, she saw a second row of boobs push their way out right below her normal pair. They were quite large as well, matching her already decent sized boobs. However, all four began to expand even more, until she was graced with 4 J-cup boobs. Her lower pair causing her upper pair to point up a bit due to their size. <br />
<br />
Using all 4 of her hands, Jen began groping herself, enjoying how nice her new udders felt. Surprisingly they didn&#39;t feel heavy to her, and she was not inconvenienced as much as she expected to be by their size. Grabbing each of her nipples, Jen gave them all a tug in the hooe that with their increased sensitivity, she would be able to finally orgasm with only her boobs. A feat she had been desperately attempting to pull off for a few years now, with no success. <br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mind was going blank from how much having her nipples tugged had pleasured her. She nearly had passed out a few times. However, she was ecstatic, because she still hasn&#39;t stopped cumming. More and more of her juices began flowing out of her now permanently open slit forming a small puddle at her feet. Wasps were pooring out of her as well, being swept along by her river of cum. Not that it was a big deal to them. They were happy with the quantity of food which their hive had provided for them, and began swarming around the floor, devouring all of Jen&#39;s cum pools. <br />
<br />
After a solid minute of nonstop cumming, Jen finally releqsed her nipples, which she had been pullimg the entire time, having locked her arms while they were fully extended due to the sheer amount of pleasure making her forget to let go of her nipples. <br />
<br />
Fully exhausted, jen couldn&#39;t even keep herself standing as her legs gave out, flopping her down in her own massive pool of cum. Her boobs though were so large, her entire torso was held up off of the floor by them, thankfully preventing her from hitting her head on the tile floor as she passed out. Becomming a makeshift pillow to cushion her while she slept.<br />
<br />
Durring her sleep, all of her wasps were busy gathering up their food, bringing it back into Jen&#39;s pussy, and storing it in various places. While they worked, jens last few changes happened. First, a large pair of semi-transparent wings had pushed themselves out of her shoulder blades, folding neatly behind her. Her other change was to her digestive system. Most of her internal organs readjusted themselves, becomming better suited for an all fluid diet, which now mainly centered around cum and sweat things. Jen, technically now part wasp, had been indirectly influenced by Kyle&#39;s curse which made her wasps able to eat her cum for food. But since she was not a full wasp, she only got half of the change. Jen could only digest liquids, but above all other liquids, prefered to drink cum the most. It didn&#39;t matter from who or what, as long as it was fresh and liquefied enough to be sucked with her proboscis. Interestingly, while Jen could feed off of a single women&#39;s orgasm, it would take many men to do the same. However, men were far easier for her to extract cum from, since she just had to slide her proboscis down their urethra and drain their balls at the source. Women would be harder to pleasure for her, but worth the effort if she was able to get them off. She could eat animal cum too, but how much would depend on the animal. A horse could set her up for a few days, where on the other hand, she would need a small army of mice to do the same.<br />
<br />
While her organs were rebuilding themselves, her boobs also underwent an small change too. Any excess food Jen took in would be directly diverted to her boobs, where it would be made into honey. Each of her boobs would now lactate honey, turning a golden hue the fuller she got. Eventually, once she was full enough, her nipples would begin to painlessly leak her honey. <br />
<br />
Jen could insert her proboscis into her own nipples and drink her honey if she wanted. And as long as she still had honey, she could survive off of it for a good amount of time since it was all technically excess food which her body didn&#39;t use. Her other option would be to extract it, and either store it or sell it. This process was not easy, since she would need to press her boobs with a special device in order to force out the honey, since just pulling on her nipples wouldn&#39;t work like it did with milk. Her honey was too thick and sticky for that. The process would be time consuming, but thankfully painless. However, nothing says she has to remove her honey, she could just let it slowly and continuously leak out of her for the rest of her life. Her wasps would ensure other bugs left her alone, and it would make her smell good too. The only down side is that she could never wear clothing again since it would be soaked in honey. But that wasn&#39;t even a concern for Jen. By now she had fully accepted that she was no longer able to be considered a normal human girl. She would likely be considered some kind of animal now, maybe a queen wasp since she actually is the queen for her hive, just one with human intelligence and general understandings. <br />
<br />
A few hours later, Jen&#39;s cum had been fully packed away inside of her pussy, and all of her workers had returned to the hive. Finally waking up, Jen took stock of her body, noting her new wings and her now slightly golden tits. Everything else seemed to be the same though, which she was thankful for. Her biggest concern now though, was her hunger pains she was currently experiencing. She needed to eat, since she had not eaten breakfast or lunch yet. She didn&#39;t even make it to school today. Checking the clock, she was shocked that it was already 11:30 am. She was passed out for hours. No wonder she was hungry. The good news for her was that she could smell her meal close by. It is...</p>
