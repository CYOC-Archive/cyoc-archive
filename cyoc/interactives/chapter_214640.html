<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A half hour later Jaspar found herself carrying a posy of flowers and following Lady Felicity who led the bridal party. A myriad of thoughts were going through her head as she stepped sedately, trying to match her steps to Felicity’s.<br />
<br />
She could do this. She would make the ultimate sacrifice and bring down the rebel committee at the same time. No doubt it would cost her life but it would be a huge step towards winning the war. She clutched her silver locket in her hand ready to release the clasps when she was in the perfect position. She just had to mentally calculate where that would be. She wanted to inflict maximum damage to the committee but minimum damage to innocent bystanders. <br />
 <br />
She could see the committee in the front row seats on the balcony overlooking the courtyard. The courtyard was filled with civilians in their best clothes and soldiers in their dress uniforms. Beyond the gates she could see crowds struggling for a view point. It reminded Jaspar of the ceremony held a year ago to celebrate his father’s 30th year of rule. <br />
The three committee members were there, Baron Beckhom, the groom’s father was sitting beside his wife. Next was Joachin, a short man of 60, self-proclaimed King of the Everglades, a man who had murdered his own brother to claim the family title. Jaspar could not understand how anyone could trust him, but he did have a huge army of foreign mercenaries under his command. Then there was Duke Henry of Gorsten, a corpulent man who was cousin of Jaspar’s father. He had been the first to openly rebel. Lastly beside Duke Henry was the witch, seated in her wheel chair.<br />
<br />
Lady Sascheme was not officially on the committee. But she was the power uniting the rebels. Her level of magic was unprecedented. She was a master of mind control as witnessed by her effect on the bride to be. Captured rebel soldiers had reported that their methods of seizing cities were based on the witch’s ability to manipulate the minds of those guarding the gates.<br />
<br />
Jaspar gazed at the old woman sitting in her wheeled chair. The witch could barely walk un-aided. Her body was crippled. A chill ran down Jaspar’s spine. Rumours were that she was over a century, she did not look so old but his father had said the Lady had been an old witch when he was a child. The witch had long blonde hair. Not the grey hair of most old women but the yellow blonde of Anya. It looked out of place surrounding her wrinkled face.<br />
<br />
The procession approached Lord Marcus who was standing proud and waiting for his bride. He was not yet Duke Marcus. That ceremony was to follow. To the right of Lord Marcus was Felicity’s betrothed, he was called Garfield if Jaspar remembered correctly. He stood proudly. Jaspar had to admit that the man was handsome.<br />
<br />
But Garfield was not as handsome as the man to his right. That was Richard, Richard Townshend, Jaspar’s betrothed. Not that she was ever intending to actually marry him. He too was standing proudly. Resplendent in his uniform, even if it was a rebel uniform. He had several inches on Garfield and Marcus and also on Joanna’s beau, who was to Richard’s right. <br />
<br />
Jaspar chastised herself.  Why was she thinking of who is the most handsome? She was a man! She should not be thinking such thoughts! Those groomsmen would be the closest armed men to Jaspar. They would seize her once the deed was done. Would Richard be the man to execute her?<br />
<br />
Or was the amulet so powerful that all in attendance at the wedding would be changed into infants? Would the city orphanage soon be having a huge influx of parentless babies? It was an amusing thought. Truthfully though Jaspar knew not how powerful Anya’s amulet was. It had taken down two attackers one time. Could it take down the committee and the witch? She hoped so.<br />
<br />
She calculated the best place to unleash the amulets power. It would be when she was between Joachin and Henry. They were nearly there. She found the clips holding the silver locket and flicked them open, catching the locket in her hand so it did not fall to the ground and attract unwanted attention. She glanced at the witch. Would she detect the amulet’s power as Patricia had?<br />
<br />
Two more steps. Now is the moment ‘Protect me!’ she commanded.</p>
