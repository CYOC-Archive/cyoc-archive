<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If that was a female orgasm, and realistically what else could it be? Then why the hell didn’t Kate want sex constantly? Why was she always putting up barriers?<br />
<br />
Tom quietly left the bedroom careful not to wake the sleeping Kate. He went to the other wing of the house. There was a guest bedroom used when they had visitors or when he came home late after a night with the boys. Kate preferred he slept in that room if he had over indulged, as supposedly he snored. Tom needed privacy. Kate had always let him know that in her opinion masturbation was disgusting. He knew that after that first experience he wouldn’t be able to stop. Woman were meant to be able to experience multiple orgasms. He wanted to test if that was really the case. <br />
<br />
First though Tom went to the bathroom in that second wing. He wanted a better look at his body. Aware that Kate was waiting for him earlier he had not explored the body as much as he would have liked, now he had the rest of the night.<br />
 <br />
First he took off his pyjamas and gazed once more at his female reflection. He tried to estimate his breast size. He knew Kate was a B cup. Kerry was noticeably larger. Despite the size the breasts were perky and didn’t sag much at all. The nipples and the coloured area around them were a darker tone than Kate&#39;s. Tom purposefully wobbled his torso and watched the tits of the woman in the mirror wobble around. He stopped quickly. It actually hurt. <br />
<br />
He then examined his groin, having a good inspection of the flower tattoo. Then getting as close to the mirror as the sink would allow, opened his flaps and had a closer look at his vagina. It was very pink and sloppily wet. He located his pee hole and the nub that was his clitoris. He started to masturbate there. However the reflection showed the woman in the mirror had his own male face and that was a bit of a turn off. He decided to take it to the spare bedroom picking up his pyjamas but did not put them on.<br />
<br />
He entered the bedroom and pulled down the doona. Then a thought entered his head. Kate kept clothes in the wardrobe of this room. Maybe she had a nightie in here. He now regretted not taking up her offer of wearing the sexy nightie.<br />
<br />
There was no nightwear in the wardrobe. Only a collection of dresses. Kate used this wardrobe as a bit of an overflow from the wardrobe in their bedroom. These were dresses that she wore only occasionally. Too good to throw out but not the sort of item she would wear to work or shopping. Tom recognised the dress she had worn at Kerry and Michael&#39;s wedding, where as Kerry’s future sister-in-law Kate had been asked to be the fourth bridesmaid. Tom had been Michael’s best man.<br />
<br />
It was a slinky reddish brown dress made of satin or silk. He could remember how sexy she had looked in that dress and how it showed off the curves of her body. Tom couldn’t help himself. He had to see what his current hot body looked like in that dress. He slipped it on over his naked body. There was a full length mirror in the room. The dress revealed the girl’s curvaceous figure. He just had to remember not to look at her face. The silk or satin of the material felt really nice against his skin.<br />
<br />
The dress had a slit up the side and Tom couldn’t help but notice how his sexy legs were revealed as he walked. He looked in the wardrobe once more and sure enough found a cache of Kate’s shoes. He found some with 3 inch heels of a similar colour to the dress and put them on. They were probably a size too big but that didn’t matter. He was able to do up the straps. Tom spent 5 minutes learning to balance and walk in the heels. He even dared to leave the room and walk to the lounge and back making sure to stay only on the carpeted floor. The shoes did make him look even sexier. He loved the way the material flapped against his legs. <br />
<br />
He returned to the bedroom and found himself rubbing his slit through the dress in front of the mirror before laying on the bed and going into full masturbation mode. Too late he noticed a wet spot on the dress, by that stage he couldn’t stop. He bought himself to climax once more. <br />
<br />
As soon as he came down he removed the shoes and returned them to where he had found them. He didn&#39;t want Kate to find out what he had been doing. He decided the dress was stained anyway. He would have to secretly get it dry-cleaned. He kept it on, turned off the light and lay down in the bed, he bought himself to climax for a third time before finally falling asleep.</p>
