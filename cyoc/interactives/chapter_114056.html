<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No! Wait!&quot; Jacob shouted, but Eriksen, the head of the hazmat team, shut the door to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Eriksen called out to the others as the door closed. &quot;We need this room sealed. Go around to the next room. Make sure the windows are shut and they don&#39;t-&quot;. He couldn&#39;t hear the words after the door closed.<br />
<br />
To Jacob&#39;s surprised, his former colleague stopped humping him. &quot;Mike. Mike,&quot; he said as the weight moved off of him. &quot;Can you understand me?&quot;<br />
<br />
However it wasn&#39;t humanity that stopped the still changing creature. The creature&#39;s attention was diverted by the sound of the door clicking shut. The snarling wolf looked around at the box of the room, and then lunged right for the window.<br />
<br />
Jacob started feeling warm, but he dove for Mike to stop him from getting out. His dive missed.<br />
<br />
Mike wasn&#39;t able to crash through the window. It was too small and the wood going across the top of the bottom sheet blocked the way. Instead he punched through it, catching one of the hazmat team who had just arrived to look in by complete surprise. Mike&#39;s claws ripped into the man&#39;s suit as he was grabbed and pulled forward. His head slammed into the top of the window, breaking the glass completely. Mike let the man go, and very nimbly Mike climbed right through. The man slumped to the ground.<br />
<br />
It had happened in seconds, but Jacob knew he had to do something. So he followed, trying to avoid the glass. Only when he was outside did the warmth he feel explode into a full fever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t move!&quot; Three men stood around him in a distant semicircle with guns out. Until a stable perimeter could be set, officers were free to shoot to kill the infected if they were under any threat. Only then would the major tranqs be pulled out to get the infected ready for transport.<br />
<br />
Many people were of the opinion the tranqs were doing the people a disservice. From what he saw of John and Mike, Jacob was no longer sure they were wrong.<br />
<br />
All three officers wore the hazmat suits. Jacob looked down at the bloodied unconscious man at his feet and then around at the area. Mike was nowhere to be seen. &quot;He got out,&quot; he shouted. &quot;Where is-?&quot; Movement one of the trees of the back yard twitched. &quot;Oh shit! He&#39;s-!&quot; A feral wolflike monster jumped down behind the man in the middle and slashed at his protective suit. One of the others quickly turned around and fired, but Mike quickly grabbed the man he cut and knocked him into the path of the bullet. An explosion of red burst from the injured man&#39;s head and Mike&#39;s shoulder jolted backwards slightly. He had been hit.<br />
<br />
A part of Jacob&#39;s mind twitched. His friend was being shot at. He took a step forward before he could tell himself there was nothing to be done. He stopped, but the movement was enough. The third member of the team, who was screaming out &quot;THEY&#39;RE IN THE BACK! THEY&#39;RE OUT!&quot; saw him move. He turned his gun on Jacob and fired.<br />
<br />
Jacob jumped sideways over the downed man. The bullet hit part of the broken window&#39;s pane. Two more shots followed. The latter one didn&#39;t miss. Jacob slumped against the wall after feeling a hard impact against his lower back. This had been the second time he was shot in the line of duty. He knew what it was as soon as he felt it. As he turned around, he said, &quot;I sur...,&quot; and then stopped. <br />
<br />
Mike had grabbed the one who had shot his shoulder and ripped him out of the outfit. &quot;No!&quot; the man screamed as he had his outfit tripped mostly off of him in a second. More men started coming around the corner with weapons out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we&#39;re dead,&quot; Jacob thought to himself. A part of him was starting to feel horny, but the pain and blood loss was helping to keep that at bay. Regardless, he began to feel muscle twinges in his back. At first he thought it was his bullet wound, but the feeling was beginning to happen in other places. It was the virus. He needed to....<br />
<br />
Two more men came around towards him. Both were SWAT. &quot;Sir, what happened?&quot; asked one. Their weapons were pointed at Mike who had bitten into the man he attacked and was gyrating against him, his large animal cock begging for a hole. Seeing that and smelling the lust caused something like a switch in Jacob&#39;s mind to flip.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; shouted the one that had shot Jacob. Only now he realized it was Eriksen. &quot;He&#39;s been-&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob grabbed the young swat member, knocked his shield helmet off, and planted a kiss. He wanted sex and nothing was going to stop him. As the young man receive the kiss in shock, Jacob pulled out his sidearm and fired right at Eriksen. He never looked to notice that even without looking his bullet went right through Eriksen&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Letting the man&#39;s head go, Jacob let in a breath of air. It was all wonderful. All of his senses were starting to explode. Even the scent of blood in the air was arousing. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; the other SWAT member started to move back, but as Mike started to stalk towards him, his attention got turned from Jacob. Jacob then shot in him the leg, dropping him to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir! You-!&quot; the officer in his hands blinked and then staggered back. Jacob smiled. He could see everything was going to be all right now. It felt right. Even as he could hear more trucks pulling up around the property. He couldn&#39;t even feel the pain from the bullet any more.<br />
<br />
Mike jumped on the officer Jacob just shot. Very quickly his pants were torn off, and Mike started to have at him. Jacob, on the other hand, suddenly felt pain over his hands and arms. It shot his consciousness back momentarily, and he could see pin pricks cutting up through his skin. But it wasn&#39;t fur.<br />
<br />
It was feathers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; Then came another bought of pain. His crotch exploded in a sensation that was hell and pleasure all in one. He fell over and struggled to get his pants off.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be alright, Sir,&quot; said the man he had kissed. &quot;It&#39;ll be over soon.&quot; He raised his gun up, pointing it right at Jacob, but then he stopped.<br />
<br />
Both Jacob and the young man stared as Jacob&#39;s privates violently, in lurches, yanked inwards into his body. In it&#39;s places was a long thin opening, slowly being covered by more small feathers. Jacob laughed. He was turning into a she. He could even feel his chest beginning to press outwards underneath his shirt.<br />
<br />
Over his surprise, the SWAT glanced at Mike, who had just finished ejaculating into the screaming man, and then taking a breath, he aimed his gun at Jacob again. &quot;Goodbye, Sir,&quot; he said putting his finger on the trigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just do it,&quot; a much more feminine voice came from Jacob&#39;s hardening mouth.<br />
<br />
The young man fired at the same time he staggered and dropped the gun. Jacob blinked for a moment, unsure what had happened. But then the young man looked up again, and all Jacob should see in his eyes was lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; s/he said aloud. Then another wave of heat swept over him, and the changes accelerated.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Federal Control Task Force came in quickly. Most of the time when flare-ups occurred, locals tended to handle matters fairly well in this state. The feds had trained them on the proper protocols, but sometimes oddities happened, and they would be needed. This was seeming like one of those times. Rebecca was saddened to hear that Abby was infected, but this wouldn&#39;t be the first time she had lost a friend or fellow researcher to this damn cursed plague. She had been hoping to converse her to come work for the CDC.<br />
<br />
Rachit put the van in park on the side of the road near the property. He was a few years her junior, but he was good at finding flaws in containment situations. As usual, he just sat in the van and looked around. &quot;Have the neighbors been evacuated?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll find out,&quot; the middle-aged woman said. She stepped out while he stayed in the vehicle. The four others on the team remained in the back. Two were listening to the police frequencies. Two more stood bye with the team&#39;s... toys.  &quot;Who is charge here?&quot; she called out. It was then that the sound of gunshots went off from the backyard. &quot;God dammit,&quot; she muttered. She never wanted to see anyone get killed, but she had been to too many shit-shows where some poor victim was gunned down for no reason. They kept people alive in case a cure could be found, after all. Several of the police vehicles moved to form a blockade around each side of the house. &quot;Dammit.&quot; Well, at least they were doing what they could to contain things. She walked up to one of the hazmat members who hadn&#39;t entered the house yet. &quot;Rebecca Forster, CDC, FCTF. Who&#39;s in charge?&quot; She had gotten enough jokes about working with this disease with a name like Forster, even though she had been in this line of work for 15 years prior to the plague. What made the joke funnier is that sometimes she used her middle initial: D. <br />
<br />
&quot;That would be...,&quot; he said. More gunshots. &quot;Ma&#39;am, stay back.&quot; He tried to move her back, but she stood her ground. Under other situations, she&#39;d have to obey. Not here. Not now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, if there is a containment issue we....&quot; More gunshots, and then movement caught her eye. From behind the house a figure flew up into the sky. To Rebecca&#39;s awe and horror, she saw a form dropping a yellow bag-like covering only to reveal a colorful and rather beautiful bird-like female form. It soared upward quickly, with many trying to open fire upon it. None could hit it as it gained height and distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit,&quot; she said as she started running back to the van. As much as the pun hurt her, she couldn&#39;t think of another way to phrase it to her team as she opened the door to the van. &quot;The virus has gone airborne. Code Robin.&quot;</p>
