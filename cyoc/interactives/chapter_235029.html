<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zooey, Meredith, and Cassidy all entered the Heavy Spurs with handbags that cost more than the average local would spend on a car. The bimbos were decked out in designer fashions, resplendent in jewelry that could feed a village in Africa for years and Zooey demanded a table right away with a sneer. Zooey was the group&#39;s alpha bitch, as it were. They were all entitled, but Zooey was a mastermind at getting what she wanted. She had manipulated her way through two marriages at the tender age of 28. Meredith and Cassidy were both fresh off recent divorces from the last year, and the group had been splurging lately on the spoils of their war on their former husbands. <br />
<br />
Meredith had the sweet charm of a failed acting career coupled with ample breasts and long honey blond hair. Cassidy had slightly plump cheeks and darker blond curls with large luminous eyes that came in handy during her brief modeling career. Zooey looked like Megan Fox&#39;s older meaner sister or a young Demi Moore with major attitude, dark hair and resting bitch face; her looks froze men in their tracks. <br />
<br />
They had wealth and privilege and they didn&#39;t care who knew it. They were millionaires and they had done nothing to earn it in the eyes of many, but in their opinion, trading their 20s and good sex with hot men for comfortable living with rich older men who were sagging, fag, aging sacks of crap was synonymous with &quot;earning potential&quot;. They still had their impressive unused college degrees and their incredible looks. They worked out with the best trainers, got mani/pedis and massages every month, and had facial beauty products from almost every country on Earth. <br />
<br />
They were pampered bitches. The ultimate housewives. They wouldn&#39;t even consider doing one of those housewife TV shows. They didn&#39;t need the extra money and it was easier to maneuver into new marriages with new suckers if they could say their former husbands were abusive to them. They all created backstories that could manage to illicit sympathy from even the most hardened hearts. <br />
<br />
Human hearts, that is. Unfortunately for them, they had entered into a new territory this evening. The overly friendly man with a huge smile plastered on his face led them to a booth. They appraised the inside of The Heavy Spurs as though it was a trash heap, because to them it was. Unimpressed, they sat down. They wouldn&#39;t have even bothered to visit a place like this if they hadn&#39;t been driving to an exclusive spa renowned for being isolated and attracting the cream of the crop of the 1 percent. <br />
<br />
There were a few men in the corner, local cowboys, overweight and middle aged. The waiter was only a bit taller than Zooey, who was the tallest of the group at 5&#39;8&quot;. Meredith was 5&#39;6&quot; and Cassidy was the shortest at 5&#39;4&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just think of it this way. We can tell stories about this place when we get there,&quot; Meredith said, picking up a menu. <br />
<br />
They all ordered plain seltzer water from the waiter, who jotted down their request. He looked eager to please. He looked to be in his early 20s, just a few years younger than they were. Cassidy and Meredith sat next to each other across from Zooey. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, did you get a load of that guy? Creeper,&quot; Cassidy noted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see...is there anything on this menu that isn&#39;t swimming in grease?&quot; Zooey asked out loud. Greasy burgers and chips, sandwiches loaded with fatty meats, breakfast dishes available anytime. Cheap beer on tap. She sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think they have tempeh?&quot; Cassidy asked. Zooey arched an eyebrow. <br />
<br />
&quot;Does it LOOK like they have fucking tempeh?&quot; she asked incredulously. Seriously, how could anyone think a braindead hick dive like this would even have...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, look! Tempeh salad!&quot; Meredith noted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Zooey showed her surprise. &quot;Maybe this place isn&#39;t such a pigsty. What I would kill for is a good watercress salad. No way!&quot; <br />
<br />
As if appearing on cue (and she could have sworn it hadn&#39;t been there before when she&#39;d perused the salad options) was orange fennel watercress salad, Zooey&#39;s go to meal at posh restaurants catering to liberal women looking for guilt free meals so they could fit into their size 3 outfits that cost more than a month&#39;s pay to someone working in a hick bar and grill like this place. <br />
<br />
&quot;See? Maybe they&#39;re used to people like us,&quot; Cassidy offered brightly, her jaw dropping, her too trusting face showing delight. &quot;It&#39;s all about manifestation. I keep telling you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all great, but I&#39;m going to invest in something more solid, like my divorce lawyer,&quot; Zooey returned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zooey, you are the best, seriously,&quot; Meredith told her. &quot;You rock.&quot; Zooey accepted the compliment, flipped her hair and regarded her nails. <br />
<br />
&quot;You guys, they have crab cakes! Those are my favorite,&quot; Meredith exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re nowhere near the ocean. I told you guys. Manifestation,&quot; Cassidy assured them. &quot;And karma. We deserved to find this place.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zooey and Meredith both nodded to that. When the waiter returned, Zooey felt there was something off about him. He was groomed so well, his shirt was impeccably clean and spotless. His hair was gleaming and pomaded, not a hair was out of place. And his name was Wilbur. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t mean to be rude,&quot; Zooey began (though she said this phrase often and it was often followed by a barb) &quot;but I just didn&#39;t think a place like this would be so...progressive in its menu.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh, ma&#39;am, that&#39;s awfully kind to hear. Our chef used to be in a big city restaurant but he got tired of all those Michelin stars and all the pressure. He and the owner wanted a nice quiet environment to test out all their ingenious recipes. We&#39;re quite lucky.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We just didn&#39;t expect such an incredible menu out here. No offense,&quot; Meredith told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh none taken, ma&#39;am,&quot; Wilbur replied. &quot;This area may not look like much but we are in proximity to several ranches and exclusive spas that have a lot to offer. Let&#39;s just say we have a very select clientele base,&quot; he grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to remember that!&quot; Cassidy was thrilled. Zooey was intrigued. Maybe she could find some rich belt buckle wearing CEO that liked to play cowboy outside the boardroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Any recommendations?&quot; Zooey ventured. <br />
<br />
&quot;The duck confit is exquisite. It always gets the highest praise.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we could split that. I could give up being vegan just for tonight,&quot; Meredith informed the group. <br />
<br />
&quot;You give up being vegan once a week,&quot; Zooey criticized her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s hard!&quot; <br />
<br />
The group ordered their individual meals, all of which were strangely better than any other version of that meal they&#39;d ever had. The women &quot;mmmmm&#39;d&quot; and even moaned a few times. <br />
<br />
&quot;The seasoning!&quot; Meredith exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s perfect!&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;This place is truly a find! I&#39;ll blog about it when I get the chance,&quot; Cassidy gushed. She had been trying to raise her influencer level lately. <br />
<br />
They managed to finish everything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you ladies like to order dessert?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, dessert&#39;s too...heavy for us,&quot; Zooey patted her lips with a napkin delicately. <br />
<br />
&quot;We actually have some very light desserts. Tonight we have a special blackberry goat milk panna cotta with orange blossom sauce.&quot; <br />
<br />
The women&#39;s eyes all went wide. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s do it,&quot; Cassidy said, excited. She was the impulsive one in the group. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? It sounds like an adventure!&quot; Meredith agreed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but we&#39;re doing pilates all weekend to make up for it.&quot; Zooey decided. <br />
<br />
The dessert was beyond exquisite. Delicate, bursting with flavor, a morsel of divinity in the form of a dessert. Halfway through hers, Cassidy belted out the biggest burp she had ever uttered. It was so loud it shocked the other two women. It sounded like a frat boy who had just attended a kegger. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus CHRIST, what the hell was that?&quot; Zooey was aghast. Cassidy was hugely embarrassed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...have no idea. Where that came from.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Was it the seltzer?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I had ice water, too,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Zooey said. &quot;I&#39;m going to the ladies&#39; room. If you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The bathroom was not impressive. It definitely showed no one had refurbished the place in a long damn time. It was so old fashioned. Even the mirrors with their heavy frames. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I should get a boob job?&quot; Meredith asked Cassidy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what Zooey says. Not until your mid 30s. You want to give your next husband a little surprise. Wait until you&#39;re 37 or so before getting an upgrade. Oh. My stomach.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP!&quot; This time it was Meredith who had belched like a drunk army platoon on leave. <br />
<br />
The two women started freaking out over whether it would happen again and didn&#39;t want it to happen in front of Zooey. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Zooey did her business and when she was finished noticed that her pants no longer fit when she tried to zip them back up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why me? Why must I suffer so? It&#39;s because I ate like a pig tonight with that duck and the panna cotta.&quot; She shook her head, struggled with the zipper. Suddenly, things somehow became confused in her hands. She was touching denim now. Jeans? Had she worn jeans tonight? Why was she wearing jeans? Sure, she wore designer jeans at times, but...she hadn&#39;t worn jeans tonight. And these were practically Target style jeans. What the hell? But at least they zipped up all the way. Relieved she looked up at her face in the mirror. Leaning closer over the sink, she thought she spotted something unusual. She gasped. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Meredith was feeling unusually bloated. As she scooped the last of the panna cotta into her mouth, she leaned back and spread her legs out in the most unladylike pose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah,&quot; the long blond haired bombshell exclaimed. &quot;That was fucking awesome.&quot; She pounded the table with a tiny fist. &quot;Let&#39;s order some beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...our diets. Zooey would be furious if we went off our diets. She depends on us. We don&#39;t drink unless there&#39;s a man worth over half a mil at the table. That&#39;s the rule.&quot; Cassidy was becoming upset. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rule schmule,&quot; Meredith told her. &quot;Hey, waiter!&quot; The ever smiling Wilbur arrived to take down her request. &quot;Give us a couple beers. You got any microbrew.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just what&#39;s on tap! But I guarantee you...you&#39;ll love it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What brand is it again?&quot; Cassidy asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Misan Draught.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t heard of Misan Draught,&quot; Cassidy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...from Europe,&quot; Wilbur told them helpfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh. European.&quot; Meredith licked her lips. &quot;Have you ever been to Europe?&quot; she asked coyly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have I? Many times. I&#39;ve had plenty of adventures on the Continent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Cassidy examined him. &quot;Are your parents, you know...of means?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say I don&#39;t have to work here. I do so because it&#39;s a good experience. I like to observe people. And my parents are...well, Mom and Pop are never lacking for anything. I don&#39;t like to brag. They always told me growing up don&#39;t brag about the family wealth.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not,&quot; Meredith said, her gold digging radar was now on full alert. Zooey thought she was so clever. Wait until I snag myself a rich college trust fund baby, she thought. This one had virgin written all over him. She could take him to a whole new level. Buy him some suits. Take him to Tahoe and show him off to all those bitches still attached to whatever geezer they were with...<br />
<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, Zooey was shaking. She couldn&#39;t believe it. All of the beauty treatments. All of the expensive spas and creams and...she had the beginnings of a mustache forming under her lips. She quivered. Felt it. Peach fuzz. Very faint. She&#39;s seen other women with facial hair over the years and laughed at them, looked down at them for needing to wax. Losers, she had called them. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no no no no no no...no.&quot; She desperately looked through her Louis Vuitton handbag to cover this mess up. How had she not seen this? Had the other girls noticed? Why was she wearing jeans? I don&#39;t remember putting on jeans, she thought. Especially not these...ow! Her feet! They hurt! <br />
<br />
Meredith sipped her Misan Draught thoughtfully. It was strange. She had never liked beer before. But now, she couldn&#39;t help herself. It smelled so good. It had the taste of a cheap beer mixed with something like gin. A smell almost like cologne and pine tar soap wafted through her nostrils as she craved more of it. It was like drinking a pine tree. She noticed Cassidy was also almost finishing hers and she was panting to boot. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I feel...&quot; Cassidy said. &quot;BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURP!&quot; She fell over and tumbled onto the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ma&#39;am, let me help you.&quot; Wilbur said, appearing suddenly. &quot;The chef wanted me to tell you how happy he was you enjoyed his meal tonight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh. Whatjoodootome?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing you won&#39;t enjoy, sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Did you get shorter?&quot; Cassidy was feeling the effects of the beer wearing off slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, ma&#39;am. I just have that sort of face. Would you guys like anything else tonight?&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Zooey finally came out of the bathroom to find her friends were getting drunk without her. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? You two bitches are having a party without me? And we do wine, not beer.&quot; Zooey held a hand to her throat. It sounded like she had a cold. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with your voice?&quot; Meredith asked. She didn&#39;t look any different but Zooey noted that Cassidy suddenly had short hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to your hair?&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Wilbur arrived with a platter full of hot wings. <br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t order these,&quot; Zooey said, her voice still dropping a few octaves. She didn&#39;t sound like herself at all. Embarrassed, she shut her mouth.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;On the house! Courtesy of the chef! You guys ready for a refill?&quot; Meredith and and Cassidy nodded happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have to try it. It&#39;s the best beer I&#39;ve ever tasted. And I tried them all in college,&quot; Meredith told her. &quot;It&#39;s like, fucking amazing. Some really good shit.&quot; Meredith was behaving strangely, leaning on her elbows at the table, entirely unladylike. Meredith scratched at her arms, which she noticed were now covered with wispy blond hairs. <br />
<br />
Cassidy could feel her breasts deflating. God, the idea of a boob job was horrendous. How could women ever do something like that? I mean, it&#39;s hot, she thought. I&#39;d never fucking do it, though. She scratched at the facial hair starting to come in. <br />
<br />
Zooey sat down as if in a daze. What was happening? But soon she was tasting a mug of beer, the waiter called it Misan Draught. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow,&quot; Zooey uttered, in not-her-voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to your voice?&quot; Meredith asked, then shrugged and ate another hot wing. She felt her stomach expanding so she loosened the buttons on her pants. Fuck yeah. Soon she was wearing jeans as well, instead of the lavender number she&#39;d put on earlier. <br />
<br />
As the women ate, more food arrived. Burgers. All three looked greedily at their plates. They were unable to stop themselves. They&#39;d never had burgers this good in their lives. They munched and munched. Their hair grew shorter. Zooey could tell through her fogged mind that something was odd. Meredith now had facial hair. And so did she. She got out her compact mirror and saw an effeminate looking young man staring back at her. She looked like a trans man, she thought in disgust. But at least she had some stubble coming in. Satisfied, she shut the compact and went back to digging into the exquisite grilled meat and cheese. As the burger dripped its juices onto her designer top, it transformed into a flannel shirt. She giggled and it came out a full laugh with a snort. <br />
<br />
Meredith had a full blond mustache now. Her boobs deflated as she ate. Zooey watched with a mixture of wonder, terror and jealousy, emotions changed quickly one into another. One minute she was resisting the changes taking place with her friends, the next she was struck by what an improvement it was to look more like a man than a woman, then she began comparing herself to both of her friends. <br />
<br />
Zooey could feel her legs getting longer and it annoyed her as she had to keep changing her position to make room for them. Her hair receded into her scalp until she had a classic men&#39;s haircut. Her chin expanded and jutted out more, her face became larger as her jawbone expanded and he rubbed his stubble. He could feel his entire frame getting bigger. His waist was growing. His breasts were transforming as they expanded into muscular pecs. They didn&#39;t deflate like his friends. They simply became like clay, pushing down and changing shape and hardening until he was able to rub them and feel the heavy weight of them. Yeah. It felt right. Hell yeah. I&#39;m so much bigger than these two fuckin&#39; pussies, he thought with satisfaction. The most muscular alpha of the group. The alpha SHOULD be bigger than his friends! Or at least work out all the time so that he could compete in terms of muscle size to anyone in his peer group. God, this beer was fucking good. He tapped his heels on the floor in anticipation before they morphed into boots. Felt better. Felt right. Tapping the floor with those heavy soles. He looked with scorn at the expensive handbag at his side, put it on the floor and watched it turn into a toolbox filled with all the essentials. He smiled. That was a lot more like it! <br />
<br />
Cassidy had long curly dark blond hair when they&#39;d come in and then it had shortened to her shoulders and now it was getting shorter and shorter. Zooey could feel herself getting excited as Cass looked finally like he should. A little bit on the short side at 5&#39;6&quot;, and a little angelic looking but definitely he could do modeling if he wanted to. Short dirty blond hair that would curl if he grew it out more, reflecting the light from the overhead lamps, a pretty golden wheat color nicely textured and neatly cut. Nice and short, 1/8 inch haircut with a nice fade. <br />
<br />
Merton was also blond, but he had straight hair and it shortened as he ate, the tresses receded into his scalp until its golden wheat color dulled a bit to a darker brown-gold, then brown. His face started to fill out, his mustache turned brown. His jawbone got bigger as he tried to make room for some steak that had appeared on the table, courtesy of the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that&#39;s so good!&quot; he said. His arms started to itch as brown hair grew all over them and his manspreading increased as his vagina sealed up and a bulge formed down there. He could feel his dick growing from a tiny little raisin and it inflated over the period of ten minutes as he started talking about this year&#39;s football season. Merton noticed his handbag was now a backpack. Cass also had a cheap backpack and for some reason, Zack had brought his toolbox in with him from the truck. <br />
<br />
Zack answered in guttural monosyllabic answers as he wolfed down his steak and eggs. He had been feeling up his new crotch. It had started off with two tiny grapes that popped out. He wanted to see what was happening down there. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; to the john,&quot; he announced. He stood up. His new height of 6&#39;2&quot; astounded him briefly. He looked around from his new vantage point in wonder. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to come with you?&quot; Merton asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t want you to fucking come with me. You fucking fruit.&quot; Zack smiled a wolfish grin as he sauntered into the men&#39;s bathroom. He felt it happening but he wanted to see it. Excited, he unzipped his fly and stared at his reflection. A gorgeous man stared back at him, black stubble and piercing eyes, tall and muscular and proud. He undid his shirt and looked at his incredible muscular pecs and he flexed his arms, and watched them grow in amazement. Bigger than any of his former boyfriends now. His arms were no longer 10 inches, that was for sure. Now they were 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19....20!<br />
<br />
Zack looked in the mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah! Twenty fucking inches! Oh, baby! Yeah! Fuck yeah!&quot; He watched as the two inch dick that had appeared all of a sudden over the mound that covered his once vagina poked out another inch. &quot;Come on! Fuck yeah! Come on! You can do it! Fuck yeah!&quot; Testosterone coursed through his body for the first time. Another inch. Another. &quot;Come on, come on, come on, come on!&quot; Zack wailed impatiently. &quot;Come on, I need a big dick here! I&#39;m the fucking alpha male!&quot; It snaked out like Play Doh until it hit 8.5 inches, and a gargantuan 7 inches thick. <br />
<br />
Zack immediately had to take a leak. How satisfying this was! Fuck yeah, I can piss standing up like a man now! My fuckin&#39; birthright! Look at that huge fucking dick! I&#39;m super fucking jacked, too. Every woman on Earth is gonna want a piece of this. Every fag, too!  He zipped up, careful not to hurt his precious trouser snake. He stared at himself in the mirror for way too long, as his friends continued to transform. When he got back to the table, Merton had a big bulge and was wearing a T-shirt that showed off his own hard earned muscle. He had a few arm tats. So did Cass. Merton was six feet tall now, and wore a baseball cap. His dick had expanded as he ate and he knew it was a respectable 6 inches long, which he told himself was perfectly alright. Totally average. At least he wasn&#39;t a tiny dicked little bitch like Cass, who never seemed to grow up like his friends. Cass was still 5&#39;6&quot; and a bit on the scrawny side, no matter how hard he tried to work out. He had delicate features but a beautiful face. Stunning, really. Total ectomorph, though. They joked around and called him Steve Rogers the Before Picture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, boys. You ready to get the fuck outta here?&quot; Zack asked his crew. <br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like your bill, sir? Wilbur looked up into Zack&#39;s gorgeous face. Zack was male perfection now. Stunningly masculine, and the smell. Zack wrinkled his nose and smelled his own armpit. Fuck that scent! Fuck, he smelled like a real man now! It smelled so fucking good! <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, man.&quot; <br />
<br />
The men talked about football and going hiking on a trip to various national parks where they would do zip lining, mountain climbing and rappelling. Merton and Zack were telling Cass not to be such a pussy and made jokes about his small four inch dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck, assholes!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we have your bill, fellas,&quot; Wilbur told them. Zack looked at it appraisingly. <br />
<br />
It read off the items from the menu as well as a lot of other things. Jewelry. Alimony payments. Trips to Mexican resort towns. Expensive spa days. Expensive shopping trips galore. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is all this?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you remember? You took men for everything they had. Their entire life savings. You do realize that you used to be women, don&#39;t you, sir?&quot; <br />
<br />
Zack looked at his friends with horror. The effects of the beer were still swimming through his system but the truth was dawning on him. He had been a women. <br />
<br />
&quot;We...were all chicks when we came in here,&quot; Merton said. &quot;How is that possible?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, the Heavy Spurs is a very special place. But you&#39;re all big men now. Except for you, Cass. You&#39;re all a bunch of bros now, at the least. Don&#39;t you like being bros?&quot; Wilbur was as chipper as ever, but there was a hint of malice in his voice. <br />
<br />
The men were looking at each other in panic and then they all stood up, got out of their booths. <br />
<br />
&quot;Try and think. Where were we going again?&quot; Cass asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;To the...the spa?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;NO, stupid. Why would we go to a fucking spa?&quot; Zack came down hard on him. &quot;We were going to start a job. The one *I* was able to get us. Remember, assholes? How I saved your fucking butts by getting that roofing job? Roofing job?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are the alpha male leader of your group now!&quot; Wilbur told him. &quot;And all you have to do now is pay your tab.&quot; <br />
<br />
Merton looked in horror at the bill. &quot;This is a joke! I can&#39;t afford this! None of us has that kind of money!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t afford to give you millions of dollars!&quot; Zack shouted angrily. &quot;Who the FUCK do you think you are?&quot; <br />
<br />
Wilbur was unfazed. &quot;We are the ones who are in control right now, Zooey. Or should I say Zack. I could return you ladies to your original forms. If you can&#39;t pay your tab.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn us into chicks? No fucking way, man!&quot; Merton was disgusted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna be a girl! Being a girl would fucking suck! I don&#39;t want to have sex with some dude!&quot; Cass was horrified. &quot;It&#39;s bad enough some guys think I&#39;m a fag just cause I look way better than you assholes!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You fuckin&#39; wish. I&#39;m way hotter than you. I could get any woman I want,&quot; Zack told him. &quot;You&#39;re the one who gets my sloppy seconds, remember that boys? You&#39;re both my wingman and don&#39;t tell me you can get girls on your own. You need me to land yourself some pussy and you know it, fairy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I ain&#39;t a fag, Zack, you fucking asshole!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, alright! Let me get this straight!&quot; Merton was panicking. &quot;Right now, we are dudes. We used to be chicks, but this place changed us and now, I can&#39;t even consider the idea of going back to that reality. I&#39;d rather be dead than a chick!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I agree with you on that. I ain&#39;t ever getting pregnant. That&#39;s my fucking job. I&#39;m gonna get a bitch pregnant some day so I can be a father. I&#39;m a fucking alpha male and NO ONE is ever gonna treat me like a sex object. That&#39;s our jobs. Men rule this world and we are men!&quot; Zack was on fire. He had never felt so alive. <br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s your choice, then I&#39;m sure we can come to an arrangement.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But now we don&#39;t have any money. We had money when we were chicks,&quot; said Cass. He had some remnants of motor oil grease on his face, Zack noticed. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a woman! Don&#39;t make me go back! I love being a guy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s it! We&#39;re leaving. Goodbye!&quot; Zack strode confidently towards the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heavens to Betsy, skipping out on your bill?&quot; Wilbur told him. <br />
<br />
Zack tried to open the door but it became a wall that swallowed up the doorknob. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid house rules are very clear about this, gentlemen. But we have of course considered that this would be an issue for you. We arranged everything else, you see. Now, the bylaws of The Heavy Spurs are very clear. If you can&#39;t pay the bill one way, you&#39;ll have to pay another...&quot; <br />
<br />
Suddenly the two heavy set cowboys who had been sitting over in the corner had arrived. They&#39;d been observing everything. They wore white cowboy hats and big belt buckles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Zack asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re security. We&#39;re here to make sure you don&#39;t do anything stupid,&quot; the taller one said. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here to make sure you sign some paperwork. That&#39;s all you gentlemen need to do. Just sign some paperwork and you can remain men and you can leave our fair establishment,&quot; the more muscular cowboy without a beard told them. Both men were in their 40s and looked like they could handle themselves in a fight. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all? We just sign?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa whoa whoa. What are we signing?&quot; Merton said in a panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just a document for our records saying that you agree to pay the bill eventually. We can help you out, of course. We can help you find jobs where you&#39;ll earn more. Maybe on an oil rig. Those are good jobs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I heard that pays a shitton,&quot; Cass said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, of course, you&#39;ll need a little bit of an upgrade, but that&#39;s all due to interest and compound interest. All you need to do to remain in your male bodies is to sign on the dotted line. Try to provide your signature as a man and your female signatures, too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna talk to whoever is in charge of this place. I don&#39;t think I should have to pay shit,&quot; Zack told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...really wouldn&#39;t recommend that, sir. You see, the owners as well as the chef are rather...skittish about meeting clients. They don&#39;t often indulge people on that request. I really wouldn&#39;t want you to put yourself in harm&#39;s way, however unintentional. I mean, anyone who could make a wall disappear and transform three gold digging whores into three red-blooded all-American men is not someone who I would want to mess around with, if you know what I&#39;m saying, sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
All three men signed as if in a daze, bewildered by everything. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, can we please leave now?&quot; Cass whined. <br />
<br />
&quot;Almost,&quot; Wilbur told him. &quot;There&#39;s just the tiny matter of the fine print.&quot; All three men looked at each other. &quot;Oh, gee golly, you know no one ever reads the fine print. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you talking about? We already made a deal. You let us go, We work jobs to earn the money to pay you back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t...always need money as payment.&quot; Wilbur had a different look on his face now. &quot;You might say that we specialize in our industry. We try to give people what they really deserve, ZACK. Why don&#39;t you three sit down. Just take a load off. We&#39;ll play some music.&quot; <br />
<br />
70s rock blasted over some unseen speakers. Misan Draught appeared in full mugs in front of the three men, who drank the beer happily. It honestly was the best tasting beer they&#39;d ever had, and it filled them up with...<br />
<br />
memories of being with women. Dozens of women. Wining and dining girls from high school and up. The Three Musketeers. They conquered wherever they went, finding conquests in the form of hot chicks that put out, just like the kings that they were. They deserved it all. <br />
<br />
Merton found Gayle, and after he got the job as a construction manager and worked his way up, he found out she&#39;d been screwing some college aged fucking shitstain woketard. Threw the bitch out and she faked an injury. Police slapped him with a prison sentence of year and a half over her claims of assault in battery when in reality she had her boyfriend beat her up on purpose to frame him. She sued him for everything he had and got it all. She got his house, she got his car. He would have been homeless if it wasn&#39;t for Zack, who he stayed with for a while. Eventually, he moved out and got his life together because Zack got him a job working as a roofer, which was very hard work and he would sweat his balls off in the middle of the summer sun, working all day like a true man. He got together with a girl named Jessica and he knocked her up twice. They had two boys who were rambunctious and troublesome and caused damage dozens of times and he could never afford that damage. Jessica stopped putting out and told him she needed him to stop drinking. <br />
<br />
Cass was another sad story. A short beta male always in the need of an alpha male to follow. Zack was the reason he got most of his jobs in his 20s. Roofing, tiling, any kind of house flipping. He did good work. He treated women way better than his buddies. Way too well. They took advantage of him, calling him Short King but then screwing much bigger studs behind his back. It broke him after the fifth time he fell in love with a woman that cheated on him with a bigger dicked man. In his own bed, no less. He turned to alcohol and drugs and wound up in a rabbit hole to nowhere. In desperation, he knocked a chick up in the hopes that she would stay with him, but she left because of the drugs. She left him and now he didn&#39;t even get to see his only kid. Alimony payments were killing him but he paid them so he didn&#39;t wind up in prison. But he did go to prison and was hit with felony charges for drug possession and intent to sell. He was used in prison by bigger men. It was a nightmare because he really was a pretty blond white boy and big black men turned him into a prostitute. When he got out of prison, he was a felon and no one would hire him, not even Zack. But Zack had little clout at his job as a plumber. He was a lot less charming now and he had become a disgruntled, bitter middle aged loser. <br />
<br />
At one point, Cass was so desperate for cash he secretly went gay for pay and sucked some dudes cocks. He hated it. He hated himself for doing it. All his dignity was gone now. He used to fight vehemently with any man that called him a fag and here he was sucking cock for a hundred bucks from faggots with nice houses. Some of them were successful married men who liked to use a straight man. A lot of them would call him faggot and he wouldn&#39;t say anything because he needed the money. He tried to go to another place as the tears fell down his face and he could feel their cocks grinding down his throat. <br />
<br />
And then there was Zack. Zack, who had so much promise. Football star in high school and college. He was on his way to the pros before he went drinking and driving and wound up plowing into a telephone pole. Did a year in prison for that. He stayed with Cass for a while. All three bros always stuck together, but Zack was disgusted that his friend was doing fag shit for money and had to get the hell away from him. He wound up getting his life together and working his way up to middle management in a plumbing company. It was dirty work, and he made good pay. He fell in love with Susan, an amazing and beautiful woman he gave his heart to utterly. And she made him suffer for it. He had never regretted anything more than getting together with that fucking bitch. She spent his money over and over again and he just let her. The alpha male he was couldn&#39;t stand up to her for some reason. She worked her charm on him. He drank more and more and gained weight. He was a hundred pounds overweight and looked fucking terrible. People thought he was in his mid 40s when he was only 30. <br />
<br />
Merton started going the same route. Both of the men would drink together. They both started losing their hair. They left Cass out of their lives for a while as his life went to hell in a different direction. The fatter they got, the more desperate they were to keep the women in their lives, who still looked great and went through all their money buying expensive perfume, dresses, going to spas...their finances were hemorrhaging. Susan left Zack for a much hotter and younger man who was a football athlete in college and now soaring through his company as a VP of finance. That guy dressed in thousand dollar suits while Zack had to wear old T-shirts because he couldn&#39;t afford new ones. Jessica left Merton for another woman and went lesbo on him, leaving with the kids. Merton and Zack tried to hit on women in bars but they were nearly 40 now and completely invisible. Cass shacked up with a man who enjoyed his body and looks and he insisted that he wasn&#39;t gay and lied about his life until his friends confronted him. <br />
<br />
The friends were in their late 30s now. When their 40s came up on them, Merton was completely bald now and grew a big beard. Zack also grew a beard but he was only halfway bald. They started smoking cigars and talked a lot about the good old days. Cass couldn&#39;t take any more of the gay for pay boyfriend he had and he had a mental collapse. Merton and Zack took pity on him and now he was living on their couch. Cass was able to get a job as a janitor at a sleazy motel for a few years, and eventually worked his way up to an office building. But everyone in that building had good jobs with computers whereas he just had his mop and bucket. He worked with Hispanic immigrants who couldn&#39;t understand a word he was saying. He was only 5&#39;6&quot; and developed a huge beer gut. He used to keep trim but the years caught up with him. He was the only one who still had his looks but women wouldn&#39;t touch an ex felon former addict with a ten foot pole. <br />
<br />
Zack held his enormous gut in front of him as he waddled up to the bar. They had all downloaded decades worth of memories and now they were all middle aged. Merton lit up a cigarette. His gut bulged under his shirt and he adjusted his baseball cap. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well fuck,&quot; Merton said. &quot;This fuckin&#39; sucks.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You motherfucker. I had a good life before and you took it all away,&quot; Zack growled at Wilbur. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is always a price in life for our behavior. Sometimes it catches up with us sooner rather than later, though in this case it&#39;s both at the same time. Time displacement is funny what way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Funny? You think this is funny? LOOK AT ME! I&#39;M FUCKING 300 POUNDS! WHAT CHICK IS GONNA WANT TO SHACK UP WITH ME? I USED TO LOOK LIKE A GOD!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Careful, buddy. Back off,&quot; the taller bearded cowboy security guard told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t live with these memories,&quot; Cass said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who the fuck can?&quot; said Merton. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are, of course, willing to cut you a deal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Zack demanded, being held back by the two cowboys, who were making sure he didn&#39;t lunge at the superpowerful waiter in front of him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said. You have to be willing to work off your debt. Several million dollars. All those shopping sprees. Nothing in life is free, after all. Especially after you fucked over men whose only crime was loving you,&quot; Wilbur told him. Wilbur sounded a lot different now, his attitude was much colder than it had been and the chipper nature had evaporated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Merton said, taking a drag off his cigarette. &quot;It&#39;s so weird having memories of a man fucking me. No offense,&quot; he told Cass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you,&quot; Cass said moodily. He just wanted to get high now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Each of you has a problem. Zack, you and Merton want to be virile again. I can turn you into a couple of hot DILFs. Muscular giants. Towering over other men. You too, Cass. We can upgrade you, make you taller and more masculine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re magical beings who transform people. Of course we can,&quot; Wilbur said. &quot;But the price for that...is that you become gay.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that!&quot; Merton spat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you!&quot; Zack shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;ve already had sex with men and hated every second of it. Can you erase all those memories so I actually enjoyed it? Or didn&#39;t go to prison? I don&#39;t want those memories.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t take them away, not without full payment of the millions you owe. After you make full payment, we can give you memories of a much happier life and restore you all to your former ages in your mid to late 20s. For now, we can drastically improve your bodies. Make you into perfect examples of masculinity. We can arrange for your alimony payments to go away as your ex wives will find themselves not needing the extra income. And you can all get jobs. You&#39;ll have your choice between oil rig and porn stars. You should know now that porn stars make most of their money with prostitution, which can be just as lucrative as an oil rig.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you, you little worm!&quot; Zack shouted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk tsk tsk. All that testosterone has gone to your head. Cass, I just need you to sign right here,&quot; Wilbur produced a contract for Cass to sign, and he did so without a second thought and without reading the fine print. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it. I&#39;m tired of being fat and old and broke. I&#39;ll fuckin&#39; sign,&quot; Merton decided. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Zack? Would it really be so bad to be attracted to men again? You&#39;ll still be a man. Only now you&#39;ll be spending way less money on women. Zero, in fact.&quot; <br />
<br />
It took ten more minutes of sitting down with Zack in order to convince him to sign. The men gave their preferences. <br />
<br />
Walking out of The Heavy Spurs were three new men, all of them wearing jeans and denim or leather vests over bare chests and arms. <br />
<br />
There was Zack, once a brilliant gold digging whore who made men want to pound her wherever she went. She had looked like Megan Fox or a young Demi Moore and she was now a 44 year old gay man who was a balding, black haired DILF. A bodybuilder stud, with tanned skin and black sandpaper stubble, lighting up a cigar and puffing on it steadily. His pecs were and arms were enormous. His monstrous cock had remained the same. His gut was no longer there and it had been replaced with abs. He stood taller than his friends at 6&#39;3&quot; and was 290 pounds strong. He was an oil rig foreman. He made 80K a year and earned every penny of it. He agreed to pay The Heavy Spurs a total of $250,000 over the next ten years, 25K a year of his salary per year, in order to earn karmic retribution for his past actions. Only then would he be restored his youth to his early 20s and he would have his choice of sexuality. A quarter of the men on the rig were promised to be gay and very amenable to him should he want to have sex. <br />
<br />
There was Merton, who had been Meredith. An unemployable whore with a ditzy blonde brain who was good at getting fucked by rich suckers who was now a bald, 6&#39;2&quot; gay man, 42 year old, 276 pounds with a big bushy brown beard. He also lit up a cigar. He had chosen a different path. Both he and Cass would be bodybuilder prostitutes. It was a faster way of making money. They would pay off $300K over the next ten years at 30K a year and they would be making a lot more than that, probably around 100K salaries. They would go to events where men would pay to touch their muscles and the rich ones would pay to suck them off or fuck them or get fucked, whatever the customer wanted. <br />
<br />
Cass was proud of his new body. He was beaming. Still blond, he was a beautiful man who served as an escort to elite Hollywood gays. He was now 6&#39;1&quot; and loving the new height. He had a gorgeous face still, though aged into DILF status. He looked like a wrestler, and he was told he should go into wrestling. He was 285 pounds. His oiled pecs gleamed. He didn&#39;t have the problem of body hair his two companions had. He now had quite happy memories of gay sex in prison and all the men that HE fucked and made into prostitutes. He commanded the attention of strip clubs, night clubs, porn movies were good for some quick cash but they only afforded him and Merton (whose stage name was Matt for the sake of his audience) the opportunity to meet rich men willing to pay them a thousand bucks each for one staggering night of amazing sex. They were gods of the gay sex world. <br />
<br />
Cass and &quot;Matt&quot; were also given the choice of sexuality after ten years. What the employees of The Heavy Spurs neglected to tell them was that the rate of going back to a straight life was very low after ten years of being gay. Men got used to a certain routine when it came to sex and soon the idea of having sex with women would be repugnant to them. It was a major headfuck to start off as women who enjoyed being fucked by men, to straight men that couldn&#39;t fathom having gay sex, to gay men who were all tops. But that&#39;s what made the job of the Heavy Spurs so enjoyable for its staff. <br />
<br />
The three men drove and smoked their cigars in a big black truck about fifty miles to a motel where they checked in. Cass took his pants off first, delighted that his four incher had blossomed to become the biggest out of all of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eleven inches, fellas!&quot; He swung his meat proudly, slapping eleven inches of pure manhood against his muscular legs. His golden blond hair had grayed somewhat. He was only 40 years old and younger than his buds. Cass fucked Matt first, finding his pockets packed with X large condoms. Cass was in heaven. This was what it was like to be a huge fucking stud. All of the men had different memories and now looked forward to gay sex. They decided to have an orgy. Zack fucked Cass as he fucked Matt (who hated the name Merton), and after that fuck session was over and they were all cumming buckets and orgasming, they decided to smoke some cigarettes. After that, Matt topped Cass. Matt and Cass didn&#39;t mind bottoming but Zack was a solid top, so he fucked Matt next as he fucked Cass. The men collapsed in a sea of muscle, sweat, cum and tobacco smoke tainted air. <br />
<br />
Zack dropped his buds off in the nearest town where their cars were being kept. They all had new IDs and new lives. Matt and Cass went their separate ways, to fuck their way across America making top dollar as gay escorts and Zack found himself going over safety regulations with new members of the crew. He worked with massive machines and his body was a massive machine. His job was dirty and backbreaking and dangerous, but he was proud of it. And the new guys were all over his dick in no time. Couple of average sized fags, he easily dominated them, and fucked their brains out so often they begged NOT to go on shore leave when it came time. But Zack had plans with some hot studs on shore who looked forward to his visits. </p>
