<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vic couldn&#39;t understand why he wanted to trust this stranger. Something in his brain told him he was perfectly safe with this giant of a man that could probably break him apart like snapping a twig. What Vic wanted to do was freak out, yell, throw things, and demand answers, but Trey&#39;s even steady gaze from those icy blue eyes soothed those urges. Still, it was a little disconcerting.<br />
<br />
Looking up at him from where Vic was seated on the sofa, he could remember them both sitting on this couch, him a little drunk, and then locking lips. The scratchiness of Trey&#39;s beard on his own smooth face, the way his large rough hands gently explored his body, him climbing onto Trey&#39;s lap and..<br />
<br />
Vic snapped away from that memory. Sure, once in a while he may have wondered what it&#39;d be like to be with a guy but that was..<br />
<br />
&quot;Remembering something?&quot; Trey asked, coming over to shove a plate with a heavily stacked bacon and egg sandwich into Vic&#39;s hands. One of the three sandwiches he had ordered. &quot;Eat up, you&#39;re going to need it.&quot; Vic&#39;s stomach grumbled a loud agreement and he took a few giant bites, ravenously gulping them down almost without chewing, which brought laughter from Trey. &quot;I remember my first month. I ate like that, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? My first month?&quot; Vic managed between bites. Trey sat down on the couch next to him, his bulk sinking down the cushion and making Vic slide a little closer to him. He radiated warmth, and not just physically. The man was like a walking security blanket, Vic simply felt safe to have him this close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the first month. Between your first and second full moons.&quot; Trey shifted to face Vic, resting an arm along the back of the couch as he watched Vic gobble down the sandwich with amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Full moons?&quot; Vic said, frowning. &quot;What? Are you telling me I&#39;m some kind of werewolf? Did you do this?&quot; Vic wanted to get angry, he could feel his blood boiling then a hand on his shoulder calmed him right back down.<br />
<br />
Trey gave his shoulder a squeeze, but laughed. &quot;Werewolf? Gods no. And no I didn&#39;t do this, it&#39;s always been in you, you got it from one of your parents. I just found you as you were about to wake up, and lucky I did. Going through this alone is a bitch.&quot; Trey grinned. &quot;You&#39;re like me, a werebear. If you were a werewolf you would have awoken years ago, but us bears, we take a while. Usually the first full moon after we hit thirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic stopped liking the bacon grease from his fingers, the only remains of his breakfast and stared at Trey. &quot;You&#39;re shitting me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey took the plate and stood up. &quot;Nope.&quot; He walked into the kitchen and got out another of the sandwiches, setting it on the plate.<br />
<br />
Vic wanted to shout at Trey that he was lying, but that same instinct that told him to trust Trey also told him the man was speaking the truth, &quot;Sorry, I wish I could remember this weekend, you probably already told me all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey handed back the plate and resumed his seat as Vic dug into the second sandwich. &quot;Nope, you were mostly interested in eating and fucking. Pretty standard for the first moon. This is the first we&#39;ve really talked since we first sat on this couch.&quot; He reached out and stroked Vic&#39;s hair, and Vic found himself leaning into the touch. &quot;You&#39;ll have full control when the second moon comes. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m here to help you through it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And after that?&quot; Vic asked as he polished off sandwich number two, setting the plate aside, staring at it. &quot;No wonder I put on ten pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s up to you.&quot; Trey leaned in and kissed Vic on the cheek before standing up to go finish putting away the groceries. He could feel himself blushing. &quot;You&#39;re gonna put on a whole lot more than that.&quot; He sighed. &quot;It&#39;s a lot of teaching I need to pass on, but we have time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you at least tell me why I.. I mean I&#39;m straight but you..&quot; Vic couldn&#39;t quite put it into words.<br />
<br />
Trey, though, just laughed as he tucked a few steaks into the fridge. &quot;I told you the first moon is a bitch alone. So we try to find each other, it&#39;s like an instinct. We can feel when someone&#39;s about to change, and you feel drawn to others of your kind, too. I knew someone was on the edge the moment I got into town, took me a week to track you down. Got there just in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s not real?&quot; Vic asked, wondering why he felt disappointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who says its not real? What&#39;s attraction anyway?&quot; Trey closed the fridge, turning and leaning on the counter as he looked at Vic. &quot;My brother is still with the one who found him, they&#39;ve been mates for five years. My, well, I guess you&#39;d call him my mentor. We hung out for the month then went our ways, the sex was good but we didn&#39;t really connect. I can say it&#39;s better with you than it ever was with him.&quot; He grinned, almost devilishly.<br />
<br />
Vic felt like he wanted to sink right into the sofa. Then two words escaped his mouth, &quot;Prove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That the sex was better with you? I mean, sure. I&#39;m good to go.&quot; Trey said, his face breaking into a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that we&#39;re werebears.&quot; Vic leaned forward, fixing Trey with the most serious stare he could muster. &quot;Change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trey stood up and frowned. &quot;Not sure that&#39;s a good idea just yet, you&#39;re still a little raw and seeing me do that, well.. Might be too much.&quot; He shook his head but returned to the couch. He dug in his pocket and pulled out his phone, flipping through something on the screen as he sat down. Finally he handed over the phone.<br />
<br />
Vic took it and looked at the screen. There were two bears, though they weren&#39;t completely animals, there was something human about the way they stood, their expressions, and even their form. And though it cut off at the waist, he could tell at least one was wearing pants. The bigger of the two was snow white, bigger and burlier than even Trey was now. His arm was stretched out, holding the phone to take the selfie, his other arm was wrapped around a brown furred bear, a little shorter but with just as much bulky muscle and a matching gut, holding a beer can that looked tiny in his massive paw-hand. They both seemed to be smiling. He wanted to call it art, or some AI mock up, but the photo was just too realistic, the fur to perfect, and the way the eyes looked into the camera were just too real. &quot;That&#39;s you.&quot; Vic said, tapping the white bear, knowing instinctively it was Trey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. I&#39;m quite striking, aren&#39;t I?&quot; He said, sounding proud of himself, but somehow not too cocky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that your brother?&quot; Vic asked, though the bears were two different colors, he didn&#39;t know how to look for family resemblance in werebears.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that&#39;s you.&quot; Trey answered. And looking at the background Vic could see it, they were standing in this apartment. &quot;I took it during one of your calmer moments after you were well fed and a little drunk.&quot; Vic looked at the brown bear in the photo, then down at himself, then over to Trey, then back to the white bear. Trey noticed and smiled. &quot;Like I said, you&#39;ll have a weird month.&quot; He leaned in close to get a better look at the picture. For a moment he had a flash of himself straddling the white bear, except his hands were paw like on the other bear&#39;s shoulders, his arms thickly muscled and covered in brown fur. He lowered himself so their stomachs and chests pressed together, warm and fuzzy, then their muzzles met.<br />
<br />
Coming back to the present Vic looked to Trey and then leaned in, pressing his lips to the bigger man&#39;s. Trey seemed surprised for a moment but then leaned into it. His beard as scratchy as that first kiss he remembered. One strong arm wrapped around him and pulled him in closer, then he felt another hand pawing at his jeans, stroking his cock through the denim, a cock which was hard as it could be. He knew if he looked down there&#39;d be a damp spot in his jeans.<br />
<br />
But that hand was quickly undoing the button on his jeans, tugging them open, pushing his underwear out of the way. Trey started to stroke his cock, and it felt better than any hand job Vic could remember. There was no reason for it to be, but it felt right.<br />
<br />
He held on to Trey&#39;s shoulder with one hand, his other slipping up under the werebear&#39;s shirt, over his round but solid gut, covered in a soft curly fuzz, that he ran his fingers through, all the way up to his rounded pectorals, his nipples sticking out like islands in the sea of fur across that mountainous chest. His fingers found the nipple and stroked it, massaged Trey&#39;s chest, no different than he would with a woman despite the soft fur, and Trey reacted as he was used to, growing more eager as Vic teased him and caressed his chest.<br />
<br />
If Vic needed any convincing he wasn&#39;t completely straight, this was it. But he had to wonder if this was because of his new state, or something he always had buried in him waiting for the right guy to come along. He bucked his hips, helping to slide his cock through Trey&#39;s hand, more intent as his orgasm neared.<br />
<br />
Vic broke the kiss, biting his lip as he came, more intensely and more powerfully than he could remember ever doing so. Enough that some of his cum splattered up on Trey&#39;s shirt and his own. Trey grinned, bringing up his hand and cleaning what of Vic&#39;s cum landed on it with his tongue. Vic&#39;s stomach growled in response.<br />
<br />
Trey laughed at the sound. &quot;You go get changed, I&#39;ll fix you something to eat.&quot; He lifted his own cum stained shirt up and over his head, revealing the meaty chest and firm gut Vic had been rubbing, and the forest of blond hair that covered both. As Trey wandered into the kitchen, Vic had to wonder if he would change that much himself, and how could that even be possible.</p>
