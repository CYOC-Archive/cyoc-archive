<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next bus pulled up with a hiss and some college students got off. A couple of the girls crossed the street and started towards walking me. They were dressed in baggy university sweatsirts, jogging shorts, and sandals.<br />
<br />
The taller had long brunette curls while the shorter had a blond ponytail sticking out the back of her ball cap. They glanced at Dr Von Hauser and I without pausing their conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would either of you be interested in a contest?&quot; I asked, stepping away from my psychologist-statue to speak with them.  They eyed me briefly and without much interest. <br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks,&quot; the brunette said &quot;we've got stuff to do.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I bit off my next line as they turned to walk away, and without thinking wished wistfully that the blond was interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, hold on a minute.&quot; The blond turned back to me &quot;what kind of contest?&quot; Sarah turned around and put her hands on her hips. &quot;Cindy, he's just going to spout some pick-up line, geeze!&quot;<br />
<br />
I was startled, then realized I'd wished without consciously meaning to. I wanted time to think about that, but the taller girl, Sarah, was tapping her foot impatiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a beauty contest.&quot; I said. &quot;To enter all you have to do is stand beside the other contestant,&quot; I gestured at Dr Von Hauser, &quot;and show me your breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah scowled at me. &quot;As if!&quot; she said and took a breath to go on as Cindy said &quot;Okay!&quot; and walked over next to my motionless doctor. &quot;Come on Sarah, it'll be interesting!&quot; Sarah stared in shock as her friend calmly removed her sweatshirt and peeled off the jogging bra she'd been wearing underneath.<br />
<br />
Cindy had a lean runner's body, not much in the way of extra fat, including in her tits. Her nipples were rose colored and she was heavily freckled.<br />
<br />
Sarah and I weren't the only ones watching Cindy, as other people from the bus began whistling and cheering.<br />
<br />
I remembered that my earlier wishes to go unnoticed had only included the doctor and I, and hastily wished that Cindy and Sarah would be included too. The wolf-whistles died away and the crowd disbursed before it really had a chance to form.<br />
<br />
Sarah walked over beside her friend and looked at her for a moment. &quot;I suppose it'll be brief anyway; yours are tiny and hers may be bigger, but mine are younger and perkier.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bring it!&quot; Cindy said, sticking her chest out, &quot;my boyfriends all love my titties!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only 'cuz you whip 'em out on the first date.&quot; Sarah's voice was muffled by her sweatshirt as she pulled it off, underneath she as wearing a pink camisole with teddy bears on it.  <br />
<br />
Cindy reached over and pinched her friend's nipple through her top. &quot;Whatever miss 'everybody gets a handjob', you're in no position to cast stones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow, hey!&quot; the two girls began to tussle, grabbing for eachother's remaining clothes and pulling them off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wooee! looks like someone's hiding a jungle in her pants!&quot; Cindy yelled as she dragged off Sarah's panties.  &quot;Better natural than a shaved-for-sex slut!&quot; Sarah said as she slapped Cindy's bare pussy.<br />
<br />
I stepped over in front of Dr Von Hauser and cleared my throat. &quot;Ladies? if you'll stand still for the judging?&quot; They released eachother and stood where I'd indicated.  Sarah was pale, though she'd gotten more sun than the Doc had. Her C's *were* perky, and she cast a superior smirk at Cindy as I examined them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice.&quot; I said, &quot;natural, and perky as advertised.&quot; I was having a blast! two chicks had just had a cat-fight over which I'd like better naked, and now were standing there letting me look all I wanted, it was like one of my wet dreams come true!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Cindy said, &quot;Mine are natural too!  She used her arms to push them together, enhancing her cleavage. &quot;And you can touch them if you'd like.&quot; She was smiling at me and winked as she said it.  I took her up on her offer and proceeded to fondle her B cups. I could feel her ribs, and the tissue moving against them as I rubbed her tits. Cindy giggled and sighed &quot;Wow, that feels really good!&quot; I knew she was just saying it, but that didn't stop my cock from throbbing in response.<br />
<br />
Sarah reached over and pulled me a shuffling step to stand in front of her. &quot;You want tits?&quot; she asked as she grabbed my hands. &quot;try these!&quot; she pressed my hands against her boobs, forcing me to squeeze and rub them. &quot;Better than those little things huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
I decided this was a good time to do what I'd planned, and without looking over wished that Cindy's breasts would start filling with milk. &quot;They won't be little for long.&quot; I muttered before pressing my face between Sarah's breasts. she let go of my hands and started stroking my cock through the front of my pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot; Cindy asked, staring at her chest, &quot;I feel funny.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Sarah reached over and copped a feel &quot;Yup, sure do...&quot; her words tailed off as Cindy's breast made sloshing noises. &quot;Oh my god Cin, you're totally lactating!&quot; Sarah stopped rubbing my cock and turned to squeeze Cindy's swollen tits with both hands. &quot;They're like a couple bags fulla water!&quot; she said as I stepped back.<br />
<br />
I was a little irked at being forgotten so easily, so I wished Sarah's tits would begin filling up too. By now Cindy's Bs had inflated, much as Sarah had said. Her skin was stretched tight across her swollen mammary glands, and she batted Sarah's hands away. &quot;Stop it, they hurt!&quot; She turned to look at me, tears leaking down her face. &quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To us you mean.&quot; Sarah said staring at her own swelling breasts. She poked one in disbelief as her formerly perky breasts began to sag and swell as they filled with milk.<br />
<br />
Cindy's had reddened and stood away from her chest like a pair of balloons. Her nipples were a dark angry red and she was sobbing quietly. &quot;They hurt, oh they hurt, do something please!&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and said loudly &quot;Ladies, the next component of the contest, shall be a taste test!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good lord!&quot; Sarah panted, her shoulders trembling under the unaccustomed weight of her milk-sodden tits. &quot;Whatever, just do something before she pops.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and enjoyed their discomfort as I prepared myself.</p>
