<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;No, I won&#39;t shut up Ty!&quot; Allen half yelled after they finished relieving themselves. &quot;You&#39;re the one who got us stuck in this situation!&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty just ignored Allen&#39;s complaints, not wanting to admit this was not one of his brightest moments. Instead, he just pulled their dick back into the pants they shared. Allen, shuttered involuntarily at the movement of their dick. He was not used to sharing one, nor did he like the fact that he was forced to. &quot;We need to wash our hands.&quot; Ty stated mater-of-factly. Allen, begrudgingly at first, zipped up their pants, and moved with Ty. They walked to the sink without any hint of trouble, not like they had previously. Ty&#39;s previous wish was working like charm. They knew how to work together, almost like having a lifetime of experience. <br />
<br />
Ty pressed on the soap despiser, letting the handful of soap it drop into Allen&#39;s open hand. The motion sensor on the sink activated. Ty and Allen rubbed their hands together, like they would have done if they were their own person. Rubbing each other&#39;s hands clean. They then grabbed a couple paper towels and roughly dried each other&#39;s hands. Allen, all the while, did not appreciated their new found coordination. He was still bent on the fact of being conjoined to Ty. &quot;You&#39;re so gullible Ty! I can&#39;t believe you let Dustin manipulate you. And worse, you dragged me into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty tried his best at ignoring Allen. He dropped the paper towel in the waste as they exited the bathroom. &quot;Will you stop complaining? I don&#39;t want to listen to you&#39;re whinny head for the whole week we have to spend together.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you should of thought of that before fusing us together, FOR A WHOLE WEEK!&quot; Allen emphasized the last part. The joined pair walked out of the bathroom into some part of the mall. Ty&#39;s wish had teleported to some random bathroom, and both teens were so turned around that they were not quite sure where they were. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well there is no point complaining about it. I can&#39;t undo it. I&#39;ll just give Dustin a piece of my mind when I see his smug face.&quot; Ty answered as he gazed around, trying to identify any land markers that would tell him where he was in the mall. <br />
<br />
Allen was doing the same, but having about as much luck. Finally both teens said to the other, &quot;This way.&quot; Both Ty and Allen tried to take a step in opposite directions. Their body teetered back and forth. They nearly fell flat on their faces, but the two managed to regain their balance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; Ty asked rhetorically. &quot;The arcade has to be in this direction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you stupid? There is a map right over there.&quot; Allen stabbed a finger towards a small sign on other end of a long hallway. He attempted to walk in the direction he had pointed out, but Ty planted his foot, refusing to budge.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t need a stupid map. The arcade is that way. I&#39;m sure of it.&quot; Ty glared at his other half, but he did not move just yet. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so stubborn! We&#39;ll just look at the map really quick to get our bearings, so we don&#39;t wander around here aimlessly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to look like some idiot tourist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t unless you try walking around aimlessly like an idiot tourist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget this! If you don&#39;t come with me, I&#39;ll make it so only I have full control of the body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allen looked visibly shocked for a second. But a smug face quickly washed his shock away. &quot;That threat is meaningless. It won&#39;t work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that I had full control of our body.&quot; Ty stated. He waited for a second, expecting for that familiar pulse. Nothing happened. He still could only feel his side of their body. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wished that we were sharing a body like Dustin and Peter. Well, they each control half. You can&#39;t undo that.&quot; Allen smiled in triumph. <br />
<br />
Ty just continued to glare at his other half, not willing to admit that Allen was right. He tried to come up with some clever comeback or wish, but he was coming up blank. &quot;Just come on.&quot; Ty tried to walk in his direction, but this time Allen planted his foot, refusing to coordinate. <br />
<br />
Allen laughed lightly at Ty attempt at dragging them. He kept his smug smile, as he spoke. &quot;No, we&#39;re equal partners in this. You can&#39;t do or go anywhere practically unless we both agree on it.&quot; Ty redoubled his efforts on pulling them, but he only ended up making them loose balance. Their feet got tangled as they tried to keep upright. They fell forward onto the hard floor. &quot;Ty!&quot; Allen glared at him. &quot;If only you would think before do anything, we would not be in this mess. You could of just wished us to the arcade, or in front of Dustin and Peter. But no, you had to try and be all tough and force me to go along with you. Well like I said, we&#39;re sharing one body. And since we have to share this body, I wish that you and I had to agree on making wishes too.&quot; A familiar pulse emanated from their chest. <br />
<br />
Ty and Allen, stared at each other, both baffled. Ty hid his shock, and glared again at Allen. &quot;Forget this. I wish we were with Dustin and Peter in the arcade.&quot; Nothing happened. Ty&#39;s shock returned. Allen had made an unintentional wish, and now it worked. &quot;What, how could? Apparently we shared more than just a body. You must have had the power as well since you were sharing my body. But, now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you can only make wishes if I agree with them?&quot; Allen smiled.</p>
