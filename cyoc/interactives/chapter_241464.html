<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I suggest we take a walk,” Kyle says, “you defiantly need some fresh air”.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “yeah, I think I do need that,” he says, he then adds with a grin, “everyone won’t think anything is wrong, especially when it comes to Caspar, to everyone he looks just like some weird dog and not like a naked human, and no one will notice Kyle having boobs, not even Kyle himself, when he is reset to normal”.<br />
<br />
Kyle blinks and looks confused, “who the hell is “Kyle” and why would he have boobs? We really should go,” he says, “you really are acting weird today, and it’s kinda scaring me. I just hope that some fresh air will get your brain functioning properly again! You are making no sense today!”<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, mentally grinning as he feels his reality alteration command take effect, “sorry, baby,” he says, “but yeah, let’s go, Caspar needs his shots and get chipped anyway”.<br />
<br />
“Aren’t the vets closed on weekends,” Kyle asks, looking confused.<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “they are, but my dad is a vet, and I have the key to his clinic”.<br />
<br />
“And you are sure you know how to vaccinate and chip a dog?”<br />
<br />
Ken nods, “I’ve helped my dad couple of times, so I know what to do,” he says.<br />
<br />
Kyle looks at “Caspar”, “where is Caspar’s collar and leash?”<br />
<br />
“I forgot to bring them,” Ken says, “but my dad’s clinic has a store, I can simply get a collar and leash and just pay my dad later”.<br />
<br />
“How far is the clinic,” Kyle asks.<br />
<br />
“It’s in the town center,” Ken says, “don’t worry, I came with my car, so we’ll just drive over and once I’ve chipped Caspar and given his shots, we’ll drive to the forest to take a walk. Sound good, Kelly?”<br />
<br />
Kyle smiles, “yeah, it sounds good to me, Ken,” he says, he then turns to look at Caspar, “I must say, Caspar already seems to be well trained. He is really focused on you and isn’t making a sound”.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “yeah, he is a good boy and a quick learner,” he says, he then gets to his feet, “well, let’s go, why don’t you get your shoes on and your handbag? I’ll take Caspar to the car and wait for you there”.<br />
<br />
Kyle nods, “I’ll be ready in a minute,” he says, “I’ll meet you by your car,” with that, Kyle walks out of Jeff’s room and into his to get his pink sandals and pink handbag which simply appeared”.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, he then turns to Caspar, “Caspar, follow,” he says, starting to head out the door, turning around and grins when he sees Jeff following him, walking on all fours. The teen leads Jeff out the house and towards his blue Mazda 2 Hybrid, opening the trunk and has Jeff jump in. Ken then gets in the driver’s seat and waits for “Kelly” to arrive, smiling when he sees the “girl” walk out the house and towards his car.<br />
<br />
“Nice car, Ken,” Kyle says, getting in the passenger seat.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Kelly,” Ken says, smiling, turning the key and the engine jumps to life, Ken pulls away from the house and starts driving down the street towards the town center.<br />
<br />
After an hours drive Ken pulls into the parking lot of his dad’s clinic, “do you want to come in, or wait here,” he asks, turning to Kyle.<br />
<br />
“I’ll come with you,” Kyle says.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, he then shuts off the engine and the two get out, the teen walks around and opens the trunk, “come, Caspar,” he says, smiling at his “dog”, when Jeff jumps out the trunk, Ken adds, “follow,” closing the trunk and locking his car before heading towards the clinic, both Kyle and Jeff following him.<br />
<br />
Inside the clinic Ken leads the two into the examination room and has Jeff climb onto the metal table and sit on his butt with his hands between his legs. “Kelly, would you mind stroking Caspar to keep him calm while I vaccinate and chip him,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Kyle says and starts stroking over Jeff’s head and back, Jeff turns his head to look at Kyle, then he suddenly licks Kyle across the face and wriggles his butt a little, “eeeew! Hey,” Kyle exclaims.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, smirking inwardly, “he seems to like you, Kelly,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad, but only one “boy” is allowed to “kiss” me,” Kyle says, looking at Ken, giving him a smile and wink as he wipes his cheek where Jeff licked him.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “hold that thought,” he says as he walks over to a cabinet, taking out two syringes before returning to the table. The teen wraps a belt around Jeff’s arm and pulls it tight so the teen’s veins swell, “this will sting a little, Caspar,” he says, taking the vaccination syringe, before sticking it into Jeff’s arm, causing Jeff to let out a yelp.<br />
<br />
“Shh, Caspar, all is good,” Kyle says, stroking the “dog”.<br />
<br />
Ken injects the liquid into Jeff before removing the empty syringe and throwing it into a bin, removing the belt, “good boy, Caspar,” he says, patting his “dog’s” head, “one last poke and you’ll be done,” he then says. The teen looks at Kyle, “please hold him tight, this will hurt him more,” he says, picking up the syringe with the chip.<br />
<br />
Kyle wraps his arms around Jeff, holding him tight while continuing to stroke and talk calmly to him.<br />
<br />
Ken pinches the skin between Jeff’s shoulder blades lightly and stick the needle into Jeff, who again lets out a yelp, almost jumping from the table but Kyle manages to hold on and soon Jeff is chipped as Ken throws the empty syringe into the bin. “Now, all we need to do is to activate the chip and officially register Caspar into the pet system,” Ken says, walking over to a desk and booting up the computer, “it won’t take long, then we can take that walk,” he adds with a smile.<br />
<br />
Kyle, stroking the whimpering “dog”, smiles back, “you are already starting to act normal again,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “yeah, I guess my mind is slowly finally waking up,” he chuckles.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, Ken exits the clinic, followed by Kyle and “Caspar”, who is now wearing a thick blue leather collar with a dog tag, which has “Caspar” engraved on the front and Ken’s name, address and phone number engraved on the back, and a leash hooked to the collar which Ken is holding loosely in his hand. Ken is also carrying a shopping bag, which contains two bowls, a dog towel, a dog blanket, some poop-bags, some dog toys and dog food, Ken had mumbled that “Caspar” wouldn’t have any issues when eating dog food when he held the bag of dry dog food in his hands.<br />
<br />
Ken has Jeff jump back into the trunk and soon they are driving out of the city and towards the forest. “I know a beautiful spot in the forest,” Ken says as he drives, “it’s pretty romantic and very secluded,” he adds with a smile and wink at his “girlfriend”, while smirking inwardly.<br />
<br />
Kyle turns his head to look at Ken, “oh? Does my handsome boyfriend have a certain… “thought” in his mind,” he asks.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “well, I just think we’re both are ready to take our relationship a step further, don’t you think, Kelly?”<br />
<br />
Kyle smiles, “to be honest,” he says, reaching over to take Ken’s hand, “I was wondering when you’d ask. I am more than ready, hun… I love you so much… and I want you to be the man I spend the rest of my life with”.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks as he feels his cock twitch, “and I love you too, Kelly,” he says, “I too want to spend the rest of my life with you. You are the most beautiful girl in the whole universe”.<br />
<br />
Kyle giggles, “oh, now you’re just exaggerating,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “just a little,” he says.<br />
<br />
After a two hours drive, Ken finally pulls off the main road and drives into the forest until he reaches a public parking lot.<br />
<br />
Ken turns off the engine and the two get out, “so, where is this spot you mentioned,” Kyle asks as they walk to the back of the car to let “Caspar” out, who immediately lets out an excited bark and runs over to a tree, sniffing at it before lifting a leg and starts pissing against the tree.<br />
<br />
The teen smirks as he watches Jeff, “Caspar will be affected by female dog heat hormones,” he mumbles under his breath, “he’ll also be able to get female dogs pregnant”.<br />
<br />
“Ken? Hun? Did you hear what I asked,” Kyle then asks, nudging Ken.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry, babe,” Ken says, “guess my brain still isn’t 100%,” he chuckles, before adding, “it’s not far, maybe an hours walk”.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Kyle says.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “come, Caspar, follow,” he then calls as he and Kyle start walking hand in hand down a path, “Caspar” lets out a bark and hurries over.<br />
<br />
As they walk Ken can’t stop grinning to himself as he watches Jeff act like a dog, having no issues with his human limbs, ‘maybe I’ll change Jeff’s hands and feet into actual paws and cause his legs to become digitigrade,’ he thinks to himself, ‘they’ll return to human once I reset him back to his normal boring self’.<br />
<br />
Ken leads the two of the path and deeper into the forest, until they finally reach a large clearing with a flowery meadow and a large pond with clean fresh water in the center.<br />
<br />
Kyle’s eyes widen, “wow, you weren’t kidding,” he says, “this… this place is absolutely beautiful!”<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “thought you’d like it,” he says, “as far as I know, no one knows about this”.<br />
<br />
Kyle smiles, “well, I’m not complaining,” he says, “at least we don’t have to worry about someone suddenly showing up while we do a certain thing, right, hun?”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “right,” he says, “come, let’s find a nice spot by the water, Caspar can have a drink and swim, while we have some… “quality time” together”.<br />
<br />
Kyle giggles, “sounds good,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, and as they start walking towards the pond, the teen mumbles under his breath, “Caspar’s hands and feet will become paws, while his hind legs become digitigrade. He is also able to swim like a dog without any issues,” his smirk widening when he feels the atmosphere tingle as his command takes affect and notices as Jeff’s hands, feet and legs shift and morph, “Caspar” however doesn’t seem to notice as he runs towards the water and jumps in, causing both Kyle and Ken to laugh.<br />
<br />
“Such a silly pup,” Kyle says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he is, but that is what makes him so cute and adorable, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it does,” Kyle says, smiling.<br />
<br />
They soon find a tree right by the water and sit underneath it, Ken has his arm around Kyle’s waist, resting his hand on the boy’s thigh, while Kyle has his own arm around Ken’s waist, resting his own hand on Ken’s thigh, both smiling as they watch “Caspar” paddle around in the pond.</p>
