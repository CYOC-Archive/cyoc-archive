<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexandra felt it. It was happening again. She knew this feeling the way one knew the <br />
phantom pain of a removed organ. She knew this feeling how one knew the pattern of <br />
scars across one's own back. She knew this feeling very very well. <br />
<br />
&quot;No please!&quot; Alexandra pleaded to the fates hugging the sleeping Kathy, &quot;Not again! Please <br />
please please not again! No more!&quot; The city was suffering the exact same fate as Prince <br />
Karther's castle. The madness had come again. Alexandra only saw the smallest tell tale <br />
signs so far, the slight shifting of the sand walls, the slightest wobbling of the floor. But <br />
her connection to this city made it scream loud and clear, the same deafening madness <br />
that had consumed the castle was now about to consume the city as well. <br />
<br />
Alexandra knew Lisa wanted her to stay put, and she didn't blame the angel in the least, <br />
the entire city was by now certainly a war zone. But Alexandra also knew that staying in-<br />
doors now was paramount to staying in the belly of a sleeping dragon about to wake up. <br />
Alexandra had been a laborer, something she had been proud of herself for, so while <br />
moving the utterly helpless Jennifer and sleeping Kathy was a daunting task, it wasn't an <br />
impossible one for her. Lisa knew Lisa's makeshift barrier wouldn't last long anyway, and <br />
Alexandra knew it was important to get outside! It may have been out in the open, but the <br />
buildings themselves could very well very soon become the enemy! <br />
<br />
Alexandra sighed and shivered. She put the revolver that Lisa had given her into the links <br />
of the lower half of her harm attire hidden underneath the overwhelming concealing <br />
traditional female arab attire. She then took hold of poor Jennifer, and hold of Kathy, it was <br />
a slightly heavy load but in a demented part of Alexandra's mind, she couldn't help but <br />
think that Jennifer due to her missing arms was a lighter load. Alexandra kicked open the <br />
door, the walls staring to look like they were being seen through warped glass in places, <br />
and pawing it as fast she could with her fellow servant and what had once been her prince, <br />
she ran for one of the palace's exits, hoping beyond hope that the walls and hallways <br />
didn't start shifting their locations on her. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Vicki and Lucy were likely flashes of light with their weapons, Lucy a maelstrom of near <br />
unpredictability, and Vicki a distinct that managed to be beautiful and lethal at the same <br />
time. Lucy almost had a right to be reckless, the clouds of sand being kicked up around <br />
them healing Lucy's damage almost instantly.  And there was one other big problem, <br />
'She's not like me.' Vicki thought, 'If I destroy her shell, there's nothing to bind her spirit to <br />
this world anymore, she'll die.  Or... I hope so.' It sickened Vicki to think so, but Lucy's <br />
spirit had been turned into such a cobbled together mess that Lucy had a hard time telling <br />
heads from tails while looking at it. 'It's even possible that Lucy... that you don't even <br />
exist... sorry, not going to believe that.' The battle was proving a stalemate now that Vicki <br />
no longer had her overwhelming advantage of having flight not actually based on <br />
aerodynamics. But as the walls and floors of the outer palace around Vicki began to waver <br />
Lucy continued to act more erratic.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come Vicki! Let's sing together! Our swords made such lovely instruments! The pose is <br />
arranged by us and us alone isn't it beautiful?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicki had a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach, she knew PRECISELY where she had seen <br />
this before, back when she was just a fennec kitesune humanoid, one of Karther's toys <br />
giving her mind back by T'. When the castle had gone mad and the wolf beasts that <br />
appeared assimilating anything in their path. It was enough of a distraction that Lucy <br />
stabbed her through a lung, the pain she had endured while being turned from a mortal <br />
soul into an angel made it feel like a nail jab in her palm by comparison, stocking, and <br />
painful, but not nearly enough to disable her, in one motion she sliced off the arm Lucy <br />
had used, and used the moments Lucy needed to form a new arm from the sand to get <br />
some distance between them, and sped up the healing process of her body a thousand <br />
fold, causing the hemorrhaging to stop and the blood from filling her lung but leaving her <br />
with less oxygen going through her system all the same.  They fight had already caused <br />
them to move quite a distance at least visually from Luna's test of wills with Natalie. <br />
<br />
'You're the strongest minded of all four of us sis', I know you can save her.' Vicki though <br />
as Lucy fully repaired hopped, skipped, and jumped straight at Vicki.<br />
<br />
Vicki created a napalm grenade and threw it at the charging sand vixen who twisted in the <br />
air with her sandy wings avoiding the blast behind her. Vicki dove into a random room <br />
now totally on the retreat. Lucy just giggled. Vicki flying still dove into the room, which <br />
was a bath chamber, and brought up her arms and wings when another grenade came at <br />
her. This however was a flash grenade and instead temporarily blinded her, Lucy slashed <br />
every which way forming a web of sword slashes around her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why the big flash Vik'? I was flyin', ya could have turned part of me into glass and I would <br />
have made so many pretty stars when they hit the ground and went crash!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're my sister Lucy.&quot; Vicki spoke telling Lucy precisely where she was, however Lucy <br />
also hear the nearly undetectable sound of something being thrown and dodged to the <br />
side as her vision returned, the wave of heat told her it had been another napalm bomb. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do ya keep usin' the same toy over and over? That's boring! Ya can make anything! <br />
Be more special!&quot; Lucky got sight of Vicki and slashed with a swing of her scimitar at a <br />
distance. Like the blade of a swiss army knife, the blade of the scimitar folded over and <br />
over and over with more mass than it could have had before nearly decapitated Vicki who <br />
redirected her blood platelets to the new cut on her neck even as she threw another bomb <br />
at her demented sister. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boring! Boring!&quot; Lucy said droing her scimitar and flying to the ceiling forming hand holds <br />
since she couldn't hover, &quot;Come to me sister, come to us sister, King Tamthis is all, King <br />
Tamthis will give us paradise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Vicki said simply, &quot;Someone else already has the market cornered regarding those <br />
items.&quot; She threw another grenade. Lucy instantly let go of the holds, and flew side ways <br />
when Viki threw another grenade at the floor. &quot;And they make a lot better sales pitch than <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze biggest big sister! Your arm sure is bad!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just have to keep trying!&quot; Vicki declared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you run out of steam first!&quot;  Lucy extended her other scimitar.   This time Vicki <br />
ducked down and felt the blade glaze her backside. She threw a grenade behind herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whao! Now you're aim is really bad!&quot; Lucy sad who was in front of her. &quot;You're not gonna <br />
win so just give up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd ask you the same thing, but I know you're too violated in your mind right now to think <br />
straight. You might be unpredictable right now Lucy, but there is a price to be <br />
unpredictable.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Lucy tilted her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Makes it really hard to plan ahead!&quot; Vicki created two more bombs and threw them to <br />
either side of her. &quot;There.... it just ended Lucy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HUH-?!&quot; Lucy blinked her solid black eyes several time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me Lucy, what do you see all around you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The half-mad winged sand vixen did..... &quot;Glass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On all six sides of you...&quot; Vicki sad calmly. <br />
<br />
Lucy again blinked as reality came crashing down on her, &quot;Uh-oh.&quot; Lucy made an instant <br />
turn for the exit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not happening.&quot; Vicki said simply proving how fast she really and grabbed both of Lucky's <br />
arms. Lucy instantly willed her arms to sand more on base reaction than strategy. Vicki in <br />
that moment sent head through them... and in a moment Lucy's arms were solid glass. <br />
Vicki grasped the sand vixen in the world's biggest hug and there was an intense flash of <br />
white light and intense heat.  When the light faded, everything but Lucy's head was solid <br />
glass, and Vicki had her head on the sand vixen's head. Lucy's black in black eyes were <br />
filled with panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't move, or you'll be a glass sculpture.&quot; That managed to somehow get into Lucy's <br />
now unhinged mind. <br />
<br />
In a swift motion, Vicki brought the cross to Lucy's forehead and Lucy's face became one <br />
of innocent awe and Vicki's one of strained concentration. <br />
<br />
'There's.... so much damage... I think I can at least sever her connection to the city... <br />
maybe... it's such a mess... I can do this... but this isn't going to be simple.'<br />
<br />
In the sanctuary of glass, effectively cutting them off from the rest of the city's insanity, <br />
Vicki began the slow and tedious process of patching Lucy's mind back into a semblance <br />
of what it was before the wolf phobia phantom had infested her and get Lucy her identity <br />
as Louis back.  'I can work on restoring her body AFTER I know she won't jump at me with <br />
intent to kill.' <br />
<br />
++++++  <br />
<br />
Luna and Natalie's fight wasn't a material one, not in the least, their bodies were locked <br />
and frozen in place, the sheer force from the conflicting efforts keeping the wolf beasts <br />
away and preventing them from even getting close to their alpha and pulling the intruder <br />
off her.  The spiritual pressure pushing out from the two was enough to knock back those <br />
bold enough to try. <br />
<br />
Luna felt them trying to worm their way into her, but these curses had been made to alter <br />
and warp mundane souls, not an angel of God. She wasn't worried about being turned <br />
back into a puppet, what realistically concerned her was her shell giving out before she <br />
could effectively heal Natalie. <br />
<br />
'Come on, come on, come on,' Luna thought. She pushed harder, not materially, but <br />
mentally and spiritually. As feared, Natalie hadn't just had another personality put over her <br />
original one like when they had been Karther's toys. Instead Natalie's true self had been <br />
warped and twisted into something like an beast. But it was still the soul of a sentient <br />
being no matter what shape it had been placed in. Luna didn't have much sublimity, and <br />
delicateness was something else she lacked. If only Lisa was here, she might have been <br />
able to do something better! 'But she isn't! I have to make due!' <br />
<br />
In reality, Luna could feel the beast slowly forcing it's arm muscles to move with the full <br />
instead of crushing the life out of Luna by compacting her brainpan. She didn't have <br />
forever. <br />
<br />
'NATALIE! It wasn't the name you were born with nor is it a name you chose for yourself <br />
but it's the name I know you by! No one ever choses their family, but I don't care! Natalie! <br />
Come on! Recognize me! Your sister! I understand things now that I couldn't couldn't be <br />
understood! I realize things that I didn't know where there to realize! I am Messenger! And <br />
my message to you is this! You are you! You are NOT an animal! You are NOT a monster! <br />
You are NOT a slave! You are NOT a weapon! I can now appreciate when a solider needs to <br />
follow orders... but you get to CHOSE whose orders you're supposed to be following! Ugh! <br />
That piece of meat in your head isn't built for processing what I'm saying anymore is it?' <br />
Luna felt the monstrous sized claws on her head. 'Okay! Fine! Let's try another language!' <br />
<br />
Luna cleared her mind of all things, all worries, no particulars, and the majority of <br />
thoughts, leaving only the base emotions and base feelings behind, and spoke with them <br />
to beast called Natalie's own heart. <br />
<br />
'Sister... sister family.... sister love sister.... family love family... family.... sister... protect... <br />
sister protects sister... family... family protect family....don't hurt... no hurt... don't hurt... <br />
love... sister love, family love... no hurt, no anger, no hate, no fury, no fire, no flame. <br />
Family. Sister. Love. Pack-mates. Litter-mates. Cub-mates. Family. Love. Cubs love. Pack <br />
loves. Family loves. Sisters love. <br />
<br />
We family. I pack. I sister. I love. <br />
<br />
You family. You pack. You sister. You Love. <br />
<br />
We family. We pack. We sisters. We Love. <br />
<br />
The link broke. <br />
<br />
The wolf beasts charged at Luna, Natalie howled at them, they stopped stopped obediently <br />
dead in their tracks. Natalie licked Luna's face. Luna slowly opened her eyes at look at the <br />
beast named Natalie. There was no blood lust for her in those eyes anymore. But as for <br />
how much intelligent, Luna couldn't tell. Natalie's vocal vocal cords weren't even made for <br />
speaking so she couldn't tell the angel weather she was herself again or merely was now a <br />
creature that now saw the angels as pack members. Forsaking all pride, Luna hugged the <br />
monsterous sized wolf woman, tears coming down Luna's furry face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I did as much as I could Natalie, I'm sorry, I'm so so sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The child angel vixen looked up at the Super Ego, &quot;So just to recheck, Tamthis, all the <br />
parts of him not assimilated yet by Tommy, all abandoned the body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The Super Ego said simply. &quot;The Id successfully absorbed the Wolf King Beast and <br />
Wolf Queen Beast personas at your urging. And you were as far as I can surmise, able to <br />
pacify the earliest version of Tammie originally created by Karther as a slave, into an <br />
aspect of Tommy rather than Tamthis. And your shed self it seems is  integrating as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shed self?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Super Ego pointed the wolf/vixen Kryiel who had melted to reveal the cherub <br />
underneath. The melted material was now reshaping into a humanoid form again. And she <br />
merely stood there.<br />
With a glazed look in her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe it.&quot; Kyriel said in the now mostly abandoned mental living room. &quot;I thought <br />
that part would just vanish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Logically you should consider your fortunate. Her presence means that you are free to <br />
go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were assimilated into Karther's collective Ego. That is what enabled clarity to begin to <br />
emerge. However, you, the cherub Kyriel are free to go, while the Wolf/Vixen Kyriel is now <br />
a part of Tommy's mind, though she lacks self meaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel was silent for a moment before saying, &quot;Then let's give her some!&quot; <br />
<br />
Taking the twin curved blades in both her hands, Kyriel now marched up to the Ego and Id <br />
unopposed and sliced the manacles off of the Ego who fell to the floor hard, the impact <br />
jarring it slowly awake. Kyriel looked at the Super Ego. &quot;Can you keep the Id in check?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the Super Ego, it is my purpose.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's right let me loose baby!&quot; The naked wolf man grinned. <br />
<br />
&quot;... like it or not.. you're a rightful part of the mind of my mother's best friend... &quot; Kyriel <br />
cut the manacles. The Id instantly jumped from the wall knocking over Kyriel on her tail <br />
and began to dance around and howled at a moon that instantly came into existence <br />
overhead. &quot;That's right baby the king is back! Bouya!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are not needed at this time.&quot; The Super Ego gave the Id a vulcan neck pinch from <br />
behind. The Id fell silent and for the moment docile, as much as the Id could at least. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile... the Ego was waking up.  He got to his feet... disoriented... he shifted between <br />
he and she... and shifted between having fox ears and a tail and not. But, he she did look <br />
at Kyriel and say, &quot;You... you're... I felt you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is Kyriel. An angel of God. She was born from the angel Tabra/Tabris and your best <br />
friend Jake/Janice fusing into a new person. She is the child of the both.&quot; It had been the <br />
wolf/vixen Kyriel who had spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake's gone-?!&quot; The Id said in clear alarm. &quot;My best buddy is gone-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His family will need to be notified.&quot; The Super Ego thought calmly. <br />
<br />
The Ego tried to ask more, but was wobbling. The Id and Super Ego came to his side, <br />
helping him stand, he started again, &quot;Then, who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a regulator, of the magical power still in this body and within our mind. Of the <br />
power Karther gave us when he changed us into his queen, before the super imposed <br />
personas took on a life of their own and destroyed Karther due to an idiosyncrasy in their <br />
programming. I am technically part of the Super Ego, since I deal with control. The <br />
magical programming that Karther implanted in us and became Tamthis had fled this <br />
vessel. Being forced to behold clarity, it chose to upload itself into the threads of mana <br />
that are holding the city he created for himself and his collected population in check. <br />
However since I can behold our power rationally, I know this'll drive Tamthis completely <br />
mad, and those within his city as well, NPCs with broken programming.  I am also currently <br />
the houser of our memories of what we did while Karther's lover, queen, and later king.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Id looked at the cherub vixen Kyriel, &quot;Let's slice this vixen in two and get our buddy <br />
back!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kryiel felt now was a good time to leave. <br />
<br />
&quot;Illogical. It would be murder. Murder is illegal.&quot;<br />
<br />
 The Ego was silent, apparently having trouble deciding if it was Tammie or Tommy. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're having trouble became most of the personas Karther made for us were female... it <br />
left lasting impressions on us. Brought our feminine side more to the surface... women has <br />
a masculine side so it's nothing personal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A short time in a female body should not bring about the end of a lifetime of a male <br />
existence.&quot; The Super Ego said and the Ego agreed.<br />
<br />
'Alexandra. Vicki, Luna, Erica, Lisa.' Kyriel thought, 'It wasn't a short time for them.'  <br />
<br />
&quot;We should deal with the most pressing threat of the Tamthis persona.&quot; The Super Ego <br />
said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No one messes with me!&quot; The wolf man growled. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the sake of the fennec kitesune race and people.&quot; The vixen/wolf Kyriel said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The Ego concluded. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Tamthis' body, which seemed to be having an identity crisis again, shifting from wolf, to <br />
fox, to human with fox ears and tail, and female and male shifting to boot half-hazardly <br />
walked disjointedly near to Kyriel's shell... which was now that of a humanoid fox of half <br />
the age of what it had been before. <br />
<br />
Erica and Lisa were naturally on edge, but this was Tammie after all, short time or not one <br />
of their sisters in there, and Kryiel was, apparently in there too... and Jasmine had said so, <br />
and they knew beyond all doubt they could trust the senior angel's word.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Tamthis' body shuddered, and Kyriel got up on her hands and feet... she looked at her <br />
hands and then her entire furry body... &quot;This is no good.&quot; The child said, &quot;None of my <br />
armor is going to fit like this.&quot; She willed a light bow into existence, at least her weapons <br />
would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sis'? Is that really you?&quot; Lisa asked.<br />
<br />
Kyriel looked up and smile and nodded. &quot;Yep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your shell's so cute!&quot; Lisa gave the smaller Kyriel a hug. <br />
<br />
Kyriel blushed, this was the first one on one hug she had been given in her entire life! <br />
<br />
Jasmine wasn't all that surprised by this turn of even. Even if Erica was wondering why the <br />
heck Kyriel was suddenly in the shell of a little girl! <br />
<br />
&quot;You can say 'I told you so.'&quot; Kyriel said calmly to Jasmine.<br />
<br />
&quot;... I do not believe I will.&quot; <br />
<br />
Erica and Jasmine, didn't let their eyes stray from Tamthis' body, whose stance was <br />
wavering this way and that, holding his head. He shrunk down, his muscle mass and tails <br />
decreasing. Finally, for the moment at least a humanoid kitesune male Tommy stood <br />
before them, his loin cloth fell off him, too big for him now. He didn't really seem to <br />
notice. &quot;Ugh.... what's going on?...&quot; He asked no one in particular trying to make sense of <br />
his memories. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tamthis was like a virus in his own city. The arabs had a saying, then you just need to go <br />
to the mountain. Tamthis had done this, or rather Queen Tammia, who was now one and <br />
the same again, had done this once before, drawing in all the magic and mass that had <br />
accumulated in the city and absorb it into himself. Thanks to the meddling of the two <br />
japanese kitesune, that was impossible now, their intrusion into the threads of magic had <br />
rendered a second performance of this trick impossible.  But Tamthis was determined and <br />
instead simply brought his mind into his city, abandoning his body for now and would <br />
reclaim it or simply create a new one at a later date. <br />
<br />
This time at least, Keiko and Akane were prepared for another set of booby traps trying to <br />
twist them into creatures that were outlets of Tamthis' insanity that had originally been <br />
Karther's insanity before Tamthis had consumed it along with Karther's power. <br />
<br />
Julio sadly was out like a light, and would be for the foreseeable future. There would be no <br />
quick save from the miracle tick this time. And suddenly Keiko and Akane weren't simply <br />
dealing with automatic defenses and booby traps, but a conscious will and design. <br />
<br />
The locals meanwhile, were going from strange to stranger to bizarre! Children rod their <br />
parents like they were horses, and was no game of 'Horsey.' A toddler became an old <br />
woman in a matter of minutes then a manly sandstone statue. A chatting couple blurred <br />
together into a giant animal that had the head of a wolf on one side and a fox. Others <br />
simply walked backwards while talking sideways. The building along the main street were <br />
the japanese kitesune were quivered and wavered like they were made of jello and join <br />
together then disconnected like a mix of clay and construction blocks. <br />
<br />
Kitesune were crazy, and so Akane and Keiko were able to ride with it, but their job had <br />
just gotten much harder.</p>
