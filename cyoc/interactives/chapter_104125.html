<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The previous episodes detailing Claire Robertson&#39;s induction to were society have been... HIGHLY entertaining.<br />
While I have no idea who is knocking on Ryan&#39;s car window right now (although I hope it&#39;s the new weretigress)...<br />
AS OUR STORY CONTINUES...<br />
<br />
Claire&#39;s new weretigress libido was making her as horny as could be.<br />
So far, she had experienced more sex tonight than she ever had in her entire life, yet it wasn&#39;t enough!<br />
<i>I don&#39;t know what a were&#39;s upper sexual limitations are, but I&#39;d love to find out because I&#39;m FAR from satisfied,</i> thought Claire with a smile on her new furry muzzle, even as she considered her options on what to do next.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Barbara drove back to her place with a lot on her mind, and all of it concerned Claire Robertson.<br />
She couldn&#39;t help wondering what Claire looked like now, with and without fur. Becoming a were added to both sides of your personality, and while there was nothing wrong with Claire&#39;s body pre-transformation, she would definitely have sharper curves and a bigger bosom now. Some normals, after joining were society, also found themselves slightly taller and more muscular too, so it would be interesting to see the new Claire. <i>I&#39;m sure even her new fursona is sexy too.</i><br />
The fact that Claire was now a weretigress also meant that she would have a were&#39;s libido as well. <i>Maybe she&#39;d be more open to a threesome now between the two of us and Ryan, or better yet: some one on one Sapphic action!</i> thought Barbara with a huge smile on her face.<br />
While she still had to work for a living, Barbara&#39;s job was flexible enough that she could set her own schedule. She also knew that Ryan was off tomorrow (Wednesday) because he had to be on duty that coming weekend.<br />
<i>Maybe I&#39;ll be able to talk at least her, if not both of them, into having some fun with me,</i> hoped Barbara, wondering who she could contact on a Tuesday night to help her scratch a developing itch instead of taking matters into her own paws again.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;Where did you learn to...&quot; wondered Ben Twist, staring at the ceiling and trying to calm down after his first fantastic bout of phone sex ever.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still young even by human standards, but even though I&#39;m not even 40 yet, you can&#39;t go through life without learning a thing or two along the way,&quot; replied Anna O&#39;Sullivan on the other end of the phone. Both were displaying their werewolf fursonas within the privacy of their own bedrooms. &quot;Stick with me and I&#39;ll be glad to show you a few things,&quot; offered Anna, knowing that sex between active weres was legal, regardless of their ages. <i>But do I really want any kind of a long term relationship with someone less than half my age? I&#39;ve know Ben practically his entire life, at least since the Twists became his legal guardians.</i><br />
&quot;If it&#39;s anything like what we had just now and last Saturday night, consider me a willing and VERY eager pupil,&quot; announced Ben. &quot;But do you mind if I ask you a few questions before we have another round?&quot;<br />
&quot;Err... no,&quot; said Anna, a tad hesitantly, in case Ben&#39;s inquiries started to get too personal. &quot;What did you want to know?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... have you ever done it with another woman?&quot; wondered Ben.<br />
&quot;Curious, huh?&quot; asked Anna in return. &quot;Truthfully, George and I attended a few orgies besides those at pack meetings, but the thought&#39;s never entered my mind. What about you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. Have nothing against those who prefer their own gender, but I&#39;m not one of them,&quot; admitted Ben. &quot;So you have had multiple partners before?&quot;<br />
&quot;If you mean more than one man at once, yes. But two&#39;s been my limit. One on each end. Orally and penetrating me at the same time. You?&quot;<br />
&quot;I have had more than one she-wolf during pack meeting orgies, but have yet to have them at the same time,&quot; replied Ben, although for some reason, he instantly vanished the thought of ever trying to get Sasha Myers and Anna O&#39;Sullivan together at the same time. &quot;What&#39;s your favorite sexual position?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be honest and admit that I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;ve experienced <i>all</i> of them,&quot; confessed Anna. &quot;I can appreciate the male dominant position, where the man is driving his hard penis into me deeper with every thrust. From this lady&#39;s perspective, there&#39;s nothing like that feeling of complete fullness to drive me over the edge, and you do that excellently,&quot; she added, to not only keep Ben hard for their next bout of phone sex, but to admit the truth as well. &quot;I do enjoy the female dominant positions too, because there are times when the lady wants a chance to be in the driver&#39;s seat, so to speak. ABSOLUTELY NO bondage or any of that more painful stuff some like because for me, sex should be about pleasure and nothing else. But for me, my absolute favorite position is any application of 69. I love it when I&#39;m slurping on a good cock even as the man&#39;s tongue is diving into my honey pot, and the more talent he has doing that, the better,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
&quot;What about yours?&quot; Anna asked in return.<br />
&quot;There are a lot of variations in regard to it, but my personal favorite is when I&#39;m not only able to hold my partner, but can look at her face as well. To see her expressions of pure joy and know I&#39;m the one making her feel that way,&quot; confessed Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just proves you&#39;re not selfish. That you think about the woman&#39;s pleasure first,&quot; explained Anna.<br />
&quot;Well, I must admit that I do wish we could of physically gotten together tonight instead of just talking to each other over the phone.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too. It&#39;s a shame we live so far apart, despite being members of the same wolf pack. Otherwise, I would love to make your fur stand on end right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I look forward to it, and if we can get together before this coming Saturday night...&quot; offered Ben.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have a great time,&quot; promised Anna, as she used the paw not holding her phone to start teasing her breasts again. &quot;Depending upon what Cassie and Eric have planned, maybe Friday night? I honestly can&#39;t foresee any chance before then.&quot;<br />
<i>Good. I still have my date with Sasha Thursday night, but—</i> &quot;The weekend&#39;s all yours you sexy she-wolf you,&quot; promised Ben. &quot;Now then, after that last bout of sex we&#39;ve just <i>had</i>, I just bet your cunt is oozing like crazy. My top knot finally slips out from your very tight vagina as the rest of my cock soon follows suit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which causes me to express a low moan of emptiness,&quot; pines Anna, allowing Ben to take the lead this time.<br />
&quot;But your juicy pussy won&#39;t be neglected for long, as I switch positions and bring my muzzle between your thighs while sniffing all the enticing scents coming from in-between your legs,&quot; said Ben.<br />
&quot;So that means there is a semi-hard lupine penis bobbing in front of my face waiting for me to lick it clean, before trying to get another hot load of werewolf cum straight from the source,&quot; realized Anna.<br />
&quot;True, and as your talented tongue starts taking its first licks, my cock is already starting to stir back into action even as I enjoy the taste of our mixed juices within your honey pot,&quot; said Ben, really getting into the role playing even as the free paw not holding his cellphone reached down to start stroking his hard red rocket again.</p>
