<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving home with the Hula Hoop Showers. They changed back into clowns and went up to their room to get ready for their friends. They were both looking through the outfits that they could wear tonight. Jax found a one piece jumpsuit that had a hoop in the middle to make it look wide. The top was light blue while the bottom half was red with colorful polka dots. He also grabbed a pair of blue clown shoes. Lex also grabbed a multi colored jumpsuit. And a pair green clown shoes.  They put on their costumes, then focusing they turned back into human boys with normal clothes. Before long Jackson and Alex’s friends Finn, Cam and Andy arrived for their party. <br />
<br />
They start out the night by playing some video games together. They then did cake. Both Jackson and Alex had their own Cakes. While they were singing Happy Birthday Jackson started to relax, Alex noticed this and saw that Jackson’s skin started to turn white. So Alex brought his hand up behind Jackson head and smashed his face into his cake, in order to not ruin the surprise. The other boys started to laugh along with Jackson who immediately grabbed his brothers head and squished it into his cake too. Expecting this to happen Jackson and Alex’s Mom pulled out a sheet cake for everyone to eat. She told the boys to go get cleaned up. Jackson and Alex marched upstairs still covered in Cake and frosting. They could finally relax, doing that they turned back into clowns along with their clothes. <br />
<br />
Finn, Cam, and Andy were all sitting in the living room eating their cake when they heard Jax and Lex walk down the stairs. The three boys jaws hit the floor when they saw their friends dressed up in ridiculous outfits with make up all over themselves. The three human boys were laughing uncontrollably. Jax and Lex then pulled out a couple of pies and hurled them at the three knocking flat on their butts as well as knocking them out. The two clown boys then picked up the three human boys and brought them downstairs where they had the Hula Hoop Showers set up. <br />
<br />
After a bit Finn is the first one to wake up he wipes the whipped cream off of his face and questions why it seems like he is in a shower. These showers had small see through window areas where Finn saw his friends Jackson and Alex dressed up like clowns. Finn ask them what the heck was going on?! The two clowns responded with you’re giving us the best birthday present you could give us right now.<br />
<br />
As they said that the shower turned on and while Finn was mid sentence when he got a full mouthful of the pink transformation liquid along with his face getting covered in it. Finn pulled his face out of the liquid and looked right at the mirror in the shower. What he saw staring back at him was a 14 white faced clown boy with a red nose and orange hair. He tried to say something but all that came out was a bubbly goofy clown voice since he had accidentally swallowed some of the liquid. Looking down he saw that his clothes had started to change next. A large light blue bow tie appeared around his neck as is T Shirt’s sleeves extended down to his wrists. White gloves appeared on his hands. Next we’re his pants. They exploded outward and fell to the ground. His pants turned a shade of light blue to match his tie. His suspenders also became light blue. Finally his shoe grew to be size 23 and became orange with light blue laces. Giggling Finn named himself Finfin T. Clown. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile while Finn was already transforming, Andy woke up and with no explanation the shower had turned on and Andy’s long Blond hair turn a deep shade of green with his nose turning red and blowing up.  His skin was bleached white and his hair curled into and Afro. His shirt turned purple keeping its shirt sleeves. His pants then connected to shirt also turning purple. The middle of the jumpsuit then expanded as if there were a hoop inside the suit. The top half of the costumes stayed purple, the bottom half received green stripes. White polka dots appeared on his shirt. Deep green size 20 clown shoes appeared on his feet. Stepping out giggling Andy saw that Finn had already been transformed.  Andy told everyone that his new name was <br />
Ando T.Clown. <br />
<br />
Finally Cam still knocked out started to be sprayed by the transformation liquid. Since Cam was still asleep the transformation liquid started to fill up the shower, the curtain as the walls of a fish tank not letting the liquid out. Since Cam’s whole body was submerged he began to absorb the liquid into his body. Because of this Cam’s hair curled into a big Rainbow Afro. His hands were covered by large gloves, these gloves made his pinky figures get absorbed into his ring finger. This also made his skin turn Snow White and his feet grow tremendously. A large red clown nose on grew from his nose. Diamonds appeared on his face as well. His shirt and pants combined into a long sleeve white jump suit with rainbow polka dot on the left side and rainbow vertical stripes on the right. Just as his clothes were finished changing Cam woke up shocked and rolled out of the shower. Jax and Lex looked over in shock seeing Cam’s Rainbow Afro. This went that Cam had the ability to change other people into clowns without having to use the showers. Looking in the mirror Cam was in shock at first but got used to it because it seemed like fun to be a clown. He said that his name would be Cambo T. Clown. <br />
<br />
Full of questions the three new clowns sat down and waited for Jax And Lex to answer their questions. Finn asked if his voice was going to be stuck like this forever? The best answer they could give was that his voice would be like that only while he is a clown. Jax and Lex gave them the run down. That they could work at the circus but live at home, move to the circus or stop being a clown completely. They all chose the stay clowns and live at home. The also explained to them that they would look normal when out in public except for tonight. As they would stay clowns until they went to bed. <br />
<br />
Walking back upstairs Finn, Andy , And Cam’s Parents were all outside waiting to pick up their kids. Walking up from the basement Jax and Lex introduced to his mom Finfin T. Clown, Ando T. Clown and Cambo T. Clown!! Getting tired the new Clowns said good night to Lex and Jax and walked out to their parents cars. Walking up to bed Jax and Lex said that this was the best birthday they’ve had in a long long time. The then drifted off to sleep.</p>
