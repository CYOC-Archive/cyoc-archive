<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry wakes to the usual humidity of his apartment. Three weeks have passed now, and still him and his family are stuck inside. The governments order for all citizens to stay indoors continues, but Harry and his family have stopped caring about that. Martin and Matt have taken well to their new environment, taking the opportunity to bulk up and be their new selves. And now, after some convincing from his friend Zach, Harry is looking forward to doing the same. His mind having fully transitioned after last night’s rest, eager to become a muscular stud like his stepfather and stepbrother. Anticipating the joys of working out harder than ever before, having his body dripping sweat and producing such a masculine scent.<br />
<br />
Harry&#39;s dick is already hard from the thought, his arm giving it a single stroke while he takes a moment to appreciate himself. His body is still rather thin and unimpressive, a light dusting of hairs across his pecs and arms but nothing so grand to pronounce him as a real man. Still, there&#39;s some signs of muscle. Some small bulk in his arms that he already takes pride in. Though that&#39;s not where his interest currently is, his eyes looking to his thick pits that still reek of sweat. Produced from a hot night in this stuffy apartment, and causing Harry to bring his nose to this scent. Taking a deep whiff of that rugged and manly smell that is at odds with his current body, but he knows that will change, his body will soon match that odour.<br />
<br />
The door to Harry&#39;s room opens. Beforehand, he would be ashamed of himself if someone caught him like this. But now, he knows its natural. His hand still rests on his dick and his nose takes one last sniff before Harry turns to address whoever opened the door. Seeing a grinning Matt who crosses his arms and raises his head. His stepbrother only in a pair of stretched boxers. His own masculine glory otherwise exposed for the world to see. Tight six pack, solid arms, firm legs. Tall and handsome, skin complimented by the brown hairs that cover his abs and arms. Beard just stubble and hair short.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good smell in here.&quot;<br />
Harry grins back.<br />
&quot;You know it. So, when are we starting?&quot;<br />
&quot;Now, c&#39;mon. Gotta get your ass into shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt pats his brothers back, clearly eager for the day of training. Harry standing up and heading off with his sibling, entering into the living room where space has been created for the day’s workout. Just like before, clothes and towels are scattered around the room. Thrown about with several being covered in sweat, used by the family during training and their usual &#39;sniff and strokes&#39;. <br />
<br />
Martin stands in the cleared space, wearing the usual shorts and vest as he stands tall and proud. Still fit and proper, still hair covered and with an odd youthfulness. The man turning to his sons with a wide smile, focusing on the small and thin Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you are committing, Harry. I&#39;m proud of you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t want to miss out on all this.&quot;<br />
Harry flex&#39;s, barely a muscle showing as the rest of his family follow suit. Dwarfing Harry with their own might as the group of them laughs.<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get to it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them start easy. A set of squats, push ups, and sit ups. Harry having great difficulty keeping up with the rest of his family. Matt and Martin both used to this routine, both groaning and grunting but still pressing on without stopping. Harry however struggles far more. His movements are slower, he can&#39;t do as many sets. Yet still, he pushes on. Determined to match his family and put his all into it. <br />
<br />
Though as he works, he changes. His thin frame expanding outwards with each rep. Body inflating at a slow pace, growing during one movement then defining in the next. Progress being made to match the others, but still taking its time. The three men sweating and groaning next to each other, bodies wet and stench starting to rise. Three similar masculine smells. Rugged, dominant, and enticing. All three men having their focus changed to that smell, as they work out harder than before. All of them erect as they now continue their regiment, dick hard and throbbing from the smell alone.<br />
<br />
Like beasts in a rut, they continue their exercise. More furious than before, pushing past their limits and taking in that mighty scent. Harry&#39;s mind is filled with images the moment that combined and intensified smell reaches him. Pictures of him and Zach, naked and together. Resting on a bed, side by side. Harry feeling Zach&#39;s gains, hands pressing against his tight pecs. Firm and leading down to his six pack. Each muscle defined and dusted with light hairs. The two of them sharing a moan as Zach returns the gesture. Reaching for Harry&#39;s own body, feeling his flat and thin chest, which expands with rapid growth. In seconds, two meaty pecs grow, filled with muscle and expanding downwards. Changing the rest of his stomach to match Zach&#39;s own build. <br />
<br />
Harry&#39;s groans rise, damn if it doesn&#39;t feel good to become a real man. His body still working out hard as it matches the idealised image of his mind, exercise suddenly easier as the thoughts continue. Light dustings of hair sprouting across his pecs and leading down a treasure trail. Thickening after a few moments as Zach buries his nose against them. Smelling Harry&#39;s own might, moving himself to his thick pits and growing arms. They too changing in seconds, thickening, and getting their own coverings of hair. Zach digging himself under Harry&#39;s pits, wetting his nose from the sweat and moaning from the scent.<br />
<br />
Harry starts shifting to his back as Zach stops his explorations, resting on Harry now as the two lock lips. Hungrily kissing the other as their masculine bodies slowly match. Harry&#39;s legs getting that last bit of bulk as the two continue their kiss. Dick rubbing against the other as Harry feels his own member enlarge and throb. Pressing against Zach&#39;s own length and girth, enjoying their intimate interaction as Harry&#39;s grunts and moans deepen in tone. His jaw squaring further as he continues to lose himself to Zach, feeling new hairs sprout forward from his chin and form into a well-groomed beard. Pressing against his partners hairless chin as the two men feel their limit approach. Pre staining their dick and chest as they continue their rut, holding the other tight as cum shoots from their cock and coats themselves in spunk.<br />
<br />
Harry takes a few deep breaths, recovering from the hardest workout of his life as he is now back to reality. Covered in sweat and reeking of BO and cum. His hand holding against the floor as he helps himself up to a sitting position, not at all shocked as his eyes look over his new self. Tall, strong, muscular. His mouth twisting into a cocky grin as he is beyond pleased from the result of his workout. No longer a scrawny little shit, Harry now finds himself as a real man.<br />
<br />
Around him are Martin and Matt, both recovering from their own workout induced orgasms. The three of them slowly getting up to their feet, before grabbing a towel and drying themselves off. Tossing the sweat and cum soaked cloth into a pile afterwards as the three men stand together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You enjoy the workout, Harry?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hell yeah! Feels good to be like this!&quot;<br />
Matt once more pats him on the back.<br />
&quot;Damn right it does little bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three share a laugh as the news turns on. The mayor of their town on the TV, standing at a self-made office within his own home. Harry remembered this guy from political ads, a wiry older man, greyed from age and weaker than an infant. But what he sees before him is far different, having a long mane of blond hairs and a body matching a muscle-gutted 30-year-old. The mayor clears his throat, his older gentler voice being lost to a new and hardy gruff dialect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, citizens. Most of you folk have been obeying the protocol and staying inside. But a few haven&#39;t. These ones are a danger, and we need to make sure they follow along like the rest of us. We&#39;ve got the cops detaining these fuckers and we need your help. Need good, strong influences in their lives so they can be just like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mayor grins, as does Harry and his family.<br />
&quot;If you have room for one of these problems, call my office. I&#39;ll send one right over.&quot;<br />
The broadcast cuts off, with Martin immediately walking to the phone.<br />
&quot;Well boys, why don&#39;t we help our town?&quot;</p>
