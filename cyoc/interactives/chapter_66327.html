<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jefferson's sheltered life had left him somewhat unaware of what the rest of the world was like. His parents controlled just about every aspect of his life.  He was home schooled from the time he was able to read. He was book smart, smarter than most kids his age. Two years ago, on his 12th birthday, his parents let him go on to the family computer by himself.  Unbeknownst to them he was quickly able to bypass the parental controls they had set on his log in account. He even figured out how create a secret subroutine that would delete his search history when he logged out.<br />
<br />
His family had just moved into area from a no name mid west town that no one ever heard about. It was a peaceful little town, very &quot;Norman Rockwellish&quot; by nature. It was somewhat self-isolated from the rest of the world in most of the modern ways. Much to the dismay of his parents, they had to move away from their idyllic way of life. Work was some getting harder to find close to home so they had to move to where the better paying jobs were to be found.<br />
<br />
At first his father was the only one working. Even with him working two dead end low paying jobs the bills never seemed to get any smaller. Eventually his mother had to get a job as well. Jefferson's parents never really felt that they could trust their son enough to let him stay home by himself while they at work. But what choice did they have. After all they couldn't very well hire a sitter for their fourteen year old son, that cost money that they didn't have. <br />
<br />
Jefferson was outside reading a book. There wasn't much else to do because his parents had locked the computer and television away in the family room. It was a warm day and Jefferson had fallen asleep under the tree in his front yard and didn't see the two large teens approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jake, isn't that the new kid that just moved into town?&quot; Ty asked his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure, I've never seen him before but he fits the description, small maybe five feet tall with horn rim glasses.&quot; Jake says replying to Ty's question then continues. &quot;Word around school is that he is home schooled by his parents. No one that I know has met him yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's time for him to &quot;meet the neighbors&quot;.&quot; Ty tells Dustin.<br />
<br />
Jake grabs his friend by the shoulder. &quot;Wait  . . . . !&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stops and looks down at the hand on his shoulder. He then looks back at Jake and gives him a &quot;take your hand off of me or else&quot; look. Jake quickly takes his hand off before he continues.<br />
<br />
&quot; . . . What are you going to do to him? You don't even know him yet? &quot; Jake says pleading with Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be quite for a second and let me read his mind.&quot; Ty shoots back.<br />
<br />
Ty probed the sleeping teen's mind and finds a very intelligent but curious young man. He found out what his name was and his family history. Even with his limited lack of contact with most things electronic he had an aptitude for computers. &quot;It must be all the book reading he's been doing.&quot; Ty thinks to himself. Ty continues to search the sleeping boy's memories until he finds something interesting. The most recent memory was web site that he had stumbled across last night, My Muscle Blog.<br />
<br />
Would you like to be that big someday?<br />
<br />
Who are you?<br />
<br />
Someone who can grant your every wish.<br />
<br />
But that's not possible.<br />
<br />
In here anything is possible, here let me show you.<br />
<br />
In less time than it takes to blink Jefferson's astral body was huge with muscle. Jefferson looked down at his body but his view was blocked by two large pectoral muscles.<br />
<br />
Oops, my bad, try this.<br />
<br />
Instantly a large mirror appeared before Jefferson. Everything was in perfect proportion for someone who had spent years in a gym getting things just right. <br />
<br />
(Now in a deeper voice) WOW . . . look at me I'm huge!<br />
<br />
Do you like it?<br />
<br />
Oh yes but  . . . . (Jefferson's now booming voice becomes meekly again) I can't be this big I'm only a teenager.  Teenagers aren't supposed to be this big.<br />
<br />
What if I told you that I could make this your normal body?<br />
<br />
I would rather have friends that would like me for who I am on the inside not the outside. Can you make me some friends instead?<br />
<br />
Are you lonely?<br />
<br />
The muscular teen's body shrinks back down to its original size. <br />
<br />
Yes I'm very lonely<br />
<br />
Than open your eyes and meet your new friends.</p>
