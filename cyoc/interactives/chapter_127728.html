<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marjorie slowly edged the four wheeled mobility scooter through the open hallways  at Horizon&#39;s offices. For years, she had battled with problems that related to her weight leaving her morbidly obese. It had been a condition for her that had mirrored Martha&#39;s that had limited her ability to hold her weight. She hadn&#39;t had the exact same condition, but it had been enough that Marjorie had simply continued to gain weight, and Marjorie couldn&#39;t avoid gaining weight and keep herself from growing to a point where moving was difficult. It was eventually such that Marjorie couldn&#39;t do more that simply sit and avoid moving and avoid feeling unable to movie on her own.<br />
<br />
She hated it, but then came Animalia. She&#39;d followed the news and seen it is as Animalians were both muscular and voluptuous animal people who were powerful and able to move easily. Most of their weight was in their muscles and they weren&#39;t being held back by their weight. It was something that she found quite amazing and wished she could equal. It was something she wished she could match and she found herself telling everyone she wished she could be like them, especially at her job at a local grocery store. In fact as she learned more about Animalia, Marjorie came to love more and more about. They seemed stronger and fit, no matter how big they got.<br />
<br />
Then came the ability of the Animalia Virus to be tailored to dinosaurs which Marjorie favored even more. She wasn&#39;t exactly one who liked dinosaurs, but she did favor that not only where they big but were the biggest land animals on earth. That seemed to reflect a lot of her own opinions on beating her obesity. The Sauropods were the largest land animals ever and she&#39;d found that in many online articles that shed found that many had many befits that went beyond just their size. Horizon and Animalia had so far only had one Sauropod based Dinotopian, Andrew, but he was a Brachiosaur which Marjorie figured was an evolutionary predecessor to the Titanosaurs that lived in the Cretaceous, especially given that and were among the largest Sauropods. Most if not all of them had their necks seem to stretch more vertical than horizontal and seemed to be built like a Giraffe but bigger. Horizon seemed to be quite ready to make the Brachiosaur and Titanosaur strains of the Animalia Virus ready for public sale almost as soon as Project Mesozoic officially opened in the summer. <br />
<br />
There was one group of Sauropods that Horizon hadn&#39;t tested yet, but did have on their list of possibilities, the Diplodocids. In looking through them, Marjorie actually found them the most interesting, as while they were among the longest dinosaurs to ever live, they actually weren&#39;t quite that heavy. Many of their bones had been found to be supported by internal struts and were otherwise hollow, which some even theorized further showed the connections between dinosaurs and birds when even dinosaurs that birds were not directly connected to had features that would by fairly typical of birds in general. Marjorie took that as a means to help get control over her weight. Her body would grow to &quot;saurian&quot; proportions and wouldn&#39;t have to worry about stretch marks  and proportionally speaking she&#39;d actually lose weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Diplodocus?&quot; Jeremy spoke down to her as he looked over the paper work. He&#39;d enjoyed Countess Irena&#39;s birthday party, but with many people volunteering to take part in the testing phases for Project Mesozoic, he couldn&#39;t stay there too long. Heather had gone with her grandmother for some &quot;family time&quot; as it were, which Jeremy understood, or at least he understood that now. The big thing for the moment was dealing with some of the various testing that would need to be done. Horizon was fairly certain that Sauropod Animalians wouldn&#39;t match the actual animals they were based on, as Andrew wasn&#39;t  eighty plus feet long and almost six and a half times as tall as a man. He was easily the largest present Animalian, but he wasn&#39;t the same size as the actual Sauropod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Marjorie said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ve always been big... never life threatening... but I&#39;ve never been healthy either. I can&#39;t stand for very long without support and I can&#39;t walk very far without getting winded. I have all I can do to get dressed and get into this cart in the morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d probably lose weight no mater what Animalian you become,&quot; Jeremy cautioned her, &quot;in that, you could become a Mouse Animalian and slim down to the size of the other Mice Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All this fat has to go somewhere,&quot; Marjorie answered with some irritation, &quot;I&#39;m not stupid. If I become something small... I&#39;m going to be bouncing of the walls trying to burn off all that energy. Might as well stick with something that&#39;s already big and deal with it. And since Diplodocus has managed to be both big and proportionately lighter... I&#39;ll go with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy slowly nodded and looked over to a human nurse who was standing quietly beside him. Under her right arm was a modest sized black plastic box. It seemed to be about the same size as a laptop computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... This is Valerie Tombs,&quot; Jeremy introduced the nurse, &quot;She&#39;s one of the nurses here and will handle the direct injection for you. Now because the Diplodocids are a group that we&#39;re technically testing for to make sure that things like height and length don&#39;t get too out of proportion... she will need to also attach a couple of specialized monitors to you to make sure that the transformation doesn&#39;t put any negative strains on your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can that happen?&quot; Marjorie asked from her Mobility scooter with one eyebrow raised.<br />
<br />
&quot;It shouldn&#39;t,&quot; Jeremy spoke, &quot;as the data we have from Dinotopia&#39;s Brachiosaur didn&#39;t have any problem in that regard... BUT we want to be careful, as while we&#39;ve been learning a lot... there is still a lot that we don&#39;t know and want to be safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marjorie then slowly nodded and Valerie Tombs came forward. The nurse lead Marjorie from the lab area that she&#39;d met Jeremy in through a few hallways and past a few series of large viewing windows that she could manage to look into. On the inside she could see a room that had a much higher ceiling than the rest of building, at least twice as high, if not higher than that.  Marjorie thought she saw something that looked like a spot where a floor had been at some point along the wall, indicating that the room had been altered, but she couldn&#39;t be certain at the moment. The one thing that she could be sure on was that there was also a large door that lead to the outside on the far wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the testing room... it&#39;s where Andrew Thomas, Project Dinotopia&#39;s Brachiosaur had his transformation,&quot; Valerie spoke as she held the door open and let Marjorie roll her Mobility scooter into the room, I&#39;d like to start with the small monitors to allow us to keep track of your vitals as you go through the process. Though also likely given that Diplodocus is one of the larger dinosaurs... you may be more comfortable...&quot;<br />
<br />
Marjorie nodded, &quot;I&#39;m sure I would... but by the time I could be ready... I&#39;d be too exhausted to transform. If you can attach this sensor... we can go from there... If I grow though what I&#39;m wearing... I&#39;ll deal with that when transforming grants me the energy and strength to deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Valerie said slowly and watched as Marjorie settled the Mobility scooter into the center of the room. She noted that woman wore a loss fitting dress, which she hoped would have enough &quot;give&quot; to allow her to get the sensor to a spot above Marjorie&#39;s heart, or at least close enough that it could track her heart beats.<br />
<br />
Valerie moved over to one set of counters that was near the door and set the plastic container that contained both sets of syringes for Marjorie&#39;s conversion and a lone medical sensor. The sensor would only be held on by a specialized adhesive that wouldn&#39;t interfere with the sensor and would be strong enough to hold its weight while being &quot;weak&quot; enough that it could be removed without doing any harm. Valerie opened the box and found the sensor sitting beside the two syringes. She lifted the sensor and removed the paper coverings for the adhesive pad before turning back to Marjorie.<br />
<br />
Marjorie only sat quietly while she waited. She heard the clicking of the box that Valerie had been carrying had been opened and eventually turned her head to see Valerie approaching with the sensor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will need to place this above your heart... or as close as I can manage,&quot; Valerie spoke &quot;Are you okay with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Marjorie nodded and managed to lift up one hand to pull down on the front of her dress. It didn&#39;t pull down very far, but it was enough that Valerie could manage to reach down and get the sensor on Marjorie. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t even mind if its cold. All of this is to help...&quot;<br />
<br />
Valerie slowly nodded and reached down to apply the sensor. Part of it was one of the odder parts of the job, but she also figured that since she was working in a lab facility that had figured out a way to create anthropomorphic animals and hadn&#39;t left, she had no way to complain. She placed the sensor down just above Marjorie&#39;s breasts, which in her condition were already rather ample but sagged heavily. She also gently patted down on the sensor to make sure that the adhesive pad was attached. It was and with that Valerie moved back to the box to collect the syringes while digging into one of her pants pockets for an alcohol swab.<br />
<br />
Valerie slowly lifted up the sleeve on Marjorie&#39;s left arm until it was rolled up above Marjorie&#39;s shoulder and from there rubbed that shoulder with the exposed alcohol swab. Once that was done she went back to the counter and collected the syringes, removing the safety caps as she moved back to Marjorie&#39;s side. The injections were handled easily and the safety caps were put back on as Valerie finished each injection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now it may take a moment to get into your system...&quot; Valerie spoke, &quot;but you should feel the effects very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Marjorie answered as she watched Valerie then turn to leave.<br />
<br />
She then sat quietly for a few moments and waited. At first nothing seemed to happen, but that was to be expected. While the injection of the Animalia Virus could mean a rapid transformation, it had been found that those that were as overweight as Marjorie was that it could take a few moments for the virus to actually take effect. Marjorie simply sat for a few moments and waited for what she knew would come, and after a few moments, she began to feel her body begin to grow warm. And it was soon a burning heat that she could feel herself beginning to sweat and sweat profusely.<br />
<br />
Marjorie looked down and soon noticed that with each drop of sweat, her arms were losing a lot of the flab that had built up over the years. Her fingers were rather thick, but now they actually looked more muscular and she noted a more pronounced claw on her pointer finger. At the same time her skin was darkening to take on a rather brownish color. The under side of her arms was a lighter shade, more of a tan color, but she could see the starting point of her transformation. She lifted up one foot and was not only pleased to be able to see her foot but that ankles were now visible and well defined. <br />
<br />
And as her body began to sweat away the excess weight she wanted to lose, Marjorie also got the added sensation of greater strength. For a lot of her life, she&#39;d never really felt strong in many ways. Some of it was the fact that she continually seemed to put on weight that she could never lose. Some of it was that more often not people had used that to her disadvantage and only fed the sort of cycle that had helped cause the problem. However, now, she had this strange feeling of strength and energy. There were a few aches here and there as muscle groups began to swell larger, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad. In fact a lot of it felt rather good as the greater aches and pains that had resulted from her weight issues were now going away. It in fact inspired her to get up and before she knew it, she&#39;d walked from her Mobility scooter to the far end of the room and found herself before a full length mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;People must like to see themselves change,&quot; Marjorie mused to herself as she looked at herself in the mirror, and soon saw all the changes that were happening.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d lost most if not all the excess fat that she&#39;d had, which was a good thing, though with all the sweating, it also for the moment left her skin feeling rather clammy, but Marjorie also noticed some other changes. For one, she was actually beginning to put on noticeable amounts of muscle. Her dress felt a bit loose on her thanks to the pounds of fat that she was sweating away, but at the same time she could feel muscle begin to replace the fat and leading to swelling shoulders and biceps and as her transformation accelerated she could actually see her new muscles bulge under her skin.<br />
<br />
The next thing she&#39;d noticed was that her neck had actually grown a little. At first she thought it was just some of her old aches and pains, but no, it was an actual part of her transformation. As her legs began to grow longer and more powerful, her neck began to grow longer. He heard began to rise upward and it was enough to distract Marjorie from noticing the fact that her human hair was falling out, and falling out in clumps.  Her growing neck was also seemingly packed with muscle that allowed her to hold it up and move it with ease. As she did so, she also noted her skin taking on a more scaly look to it and holding a largely brownish dorsal side with a more tannish underside. She also found that while her new neck wasn&#39;t as flexible as a snake&#39;s, it was flexible enough to let her move in various directions. As she did this, Marjorie noted a series of small spines rising out on the top portion of her neck.<br />
<br />
Soon that ache seemed to settle on her hips and her spine. By know, Marjorie could see that her hips were easily wider than they were before and her legs had become fairly long with well toned muscle supporting them, and she had the happy confidence that her legs looked good on her now, even as her growing sauropod feet forced her to kick off her shoes. However, that growing ache on her spine grew stronger  and soon, Marjorie felt something begin to push against her underwear, which she was actually struggling to keep on as the garment she&#39;d had had been made for the old her.  And then with a series of cracking sounds a long tail grew out behind her, destroying her underwear and lifting up the back of her dress, which around her neck and chest was staring to get a bit tight on her. The tail grew out long with a strong muscular base, but soon rapidly narrowed. It even got to a point where the end of her tail was very thin and as she moved it, Marjorie almost thought she heard it snap like a whip, but she could not be sure as her tail&#39;s length was enough that as she wagged it, she could actually touch each of the side walls with the tip of her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here I am,&quot; Marjorie thought to her self as she felt her face push forward slightly, he nose flattening with her nostrils moving to the top of her head, &quot;a happy and sexy sauropod...&quot;<br />
<br />
And in a way, she did feel that way. She stood tall and thin, far thinner than she&#39;d been in years, but by standing tall... she was also now far taller than even Jeremy was. In fact as Marjorie looked around the room, her head was now well above the spot that looked like it might have been a point where the ceiling and floor of the level above the room had been removed. A lot of it was in her new longer neck, but a good portion of it was thanks to her now longer legs and torso. And all that growth had in many ways left the dress she&#39;d worn useless. It wasn&#39;t long enough now to cover everything and effectively ended at her hips. In fact, Marjorie could look and see the juncture between her legs, which felt a bit aroused at the moment.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the dress though, was that it was tight around her neck and also tight in the chest. Around her stomach, it actually wasn&#39;t too bad, but then the dress had been made for a very overweight woman with low energy levels. Marjorie wasn&#39;t that woman anymore, and as she looked to the mirror that was very obvious. In proportion to her height, she was now a thin and muscular Dinotopian with quite voluptuous curves. In fact she noticed those right away in the mirror. The reasons why her dress was now so tight around her chest was that her breasts had not only become firm and pronounced, they&#39;d also grown a bit larger and as she moved she could feel them bounce slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is nice,&quot; Marjorie smiled to herself as she lifted up her arms and with great strength and power tore the dress in half, letting her breathe a bit easier and letting her very impressive bosom bounce. &quot;Of course from all the news reports... Animalians all seem to be built this way... As bigger is better...&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused at marveling at her new body to look over to the Mobility scooter that she&#39;d come in on. It didn&#39;t even reach her knee now and she felt stronger than she&#39;d felt in ages.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to throw that whole thing in a dumpster,&quot; Marjorie thought to herself confidently, &quot;and I&#39;m big enough in all the right ways to do it!&quot;</p>
