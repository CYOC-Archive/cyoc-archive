<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The ride to the North Pole was long, but it felt short for Chad. It was because worries filled his mind. He was now a reindeer. Santa&#39;s reindeer. What did this mean? Would he spend the rest of eternity as an ungulate, munching on grass and waiting for that one night once a year so he he could travel around the world and help Santa distribute his presents? Would he have to eat only carrots and grass and vegetables and say goodbye to delicious human food but that reindeer could not digest? And... What about sex? Would he have to mount female reindeers? Would he find them attractive? The mere notion of mating with female reindeers, even if he was one now, repulsed him to the last degree. <br />
Eventually, when they arrived, Hermie said he would go explain the situation to Santa and Chad was left in an empty barn, awaiting his fate. The hay did look tasty, though... The smell made his nostrils twitch and his mouth was slobbering just for a tiny little taste. It sounded yummier than a salad with sauce! Yummier than fries, even! They were both vegetables, right? Would it really be a humiliation or cement his condition as a reindeer if he had just the teensiest of bites? Luckily, three people arriving cut his dilemma short. It was Hermie, Santa and another creature which, thanks to popular media and renewed interest, Chad immediately identified as Krampus. And he was smiling an evil grin indeed. Uh-oh. This could not bode well...<br />
&quot;Another reindeer? But Hermie I already have plenty,&quot; sighed Santa. &quot;Maybe as a stud, but then again plenty are already...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, no problem,&quot; interrupted Krampus. &quot;Leave him to me, Santa. After all, he is on the &#39;Naughty List&#39;, is he not?&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; sighed Santa. &quot;And considering the list of past offences, I do believe he is irrecuperable. Worthy of being taken away by you for good, I must say. Sometimes, you wonder about the parents...&quot;<br />
&quot;Perfect!&quot; said gleefully Krampus. &quot;I know a satyr couple who will just love to have him as a Christmas present!&quot;<br />
What? What was all that supposed to mean? Hey! Chad uttered low mournful and frightened cries. No! Don&#39;t give him to that horrible goat guy? What did he mean? He must not have been THAT bad. No one told him bullying and being a jerk could make him being snatched away by Krampus! No fair! If he had known, he would have been a good boy, honest! He was framed! It wasn&#39;t fair! Krampus advanced on him, ready to utter a spell, Hermie laughed and Santa did shoot one last sorry look at Chad. Well, rules were rules and if did help the boy to become a better person eventually... Chad had been so bad that he know belonged to Krampus. Those were how things worked. The powerful satyr now had dominion over him and could do as he pleased.<br />
Krampus pointed a finger at Chad, and before he knew it, a blast of magic hit him. First he felt the fur receding from his arms and torso, then the horns recede. His pelvis shifted so that he would be walking upright again. His muzzle flattened dramatically and returned to its previous shape. Chad was elated. He was going to be human again! So when the transformation finally stopped, he was dismayed to see his feet still had hooves. His legs were still hairy. In fact, all of his lower body, from his wait down, was still hairy! That ridiculous tail was there still, too! And his arms! The muscles were gone, his prized muscles! Replaced by fat! And his fingers just looked like chubby sausages! That horrible Krampus has made him a chubby guy! That jerk! And... With fear and ensuing dismay, Chad checked out his groin and found that his privates had not escaped the changes. His penis was smaller than an acorn and his testicles resembled two puny marbles. He got up to voice his anger but stumbled to the ground. He was not only fat, he was weak! He started to yell at the ones responsible for his plight when two other horrid changes struck him. First, his words only came out as incoherent babble. Then, everyone was staring down at him. They had become giants! The barn too had taken gigantic proportions! <br />
&quot;Oh, how adorable!&quot; cooed Hermie. &quot;Who knew such a jerk could become the cutest reindeer baby satyr?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am that talented,&quot; smirked Krampus. &quot;An adorable toddler to make a family very happy this Christmas.&quot;<br />
&quot;I bet that bully never brought as much joy to anybody before!&quot; laughed Hermie. <br />
&#39;A satyr? Me? A toddler?&#39; thought Chad in desperation.<br />
&quot;Let me get things and then we&#39;ll be on our way to my realm,&quot; said Krampus, marching off.<br />
In the meantime, Hermie grabbed Chad under the arms took him to a little mirror. Chad protested but for all intents and purposes he did look like a fussy one-year-old, albeit with hooves, horns and a lot more hair. Then, Krampus returned and with another spell Chad found himself with a cloth diaper around his groin and with a safety pin on the front. The goat-like human returned with a wicker basket, meant as a baby carrier and placed blankets with Christmas cookies and sugar canes imprinted on it. He then took Chad, wrapped him in a blanket with themes from &quot;The Grinch&quot; and set him gently in the basket.<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m not as cruel as you, here&#39;s MY Christmas present,&quot; smirked Krampus. &quot;You&#39;ve been regressed to a toddler satyr. With reindeer attributes. I&#39;m originally a satyr from my own realm of mythology, albeit a very powerful satyr, as you saw for yourself. I punish bad kids there. One nice punishment is to regress the bad kids and make then live their lives again amongst our people. They get raised better. You&#39;ll get adopted by a male couple who just can&#39;t wait for your arrival! They decided to call you Cookie, because of the near time of Christmas, isn&#39;t that adorable? They are are sweet satyrs, in spite of your stupid prejudices against homosexuals. Hopefully you shall grow up a better person. With my next spell, you&#39;ll fall asleep, and your memories will be erased forever. You shall be left with the mind you had at one.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, your parents will be rid of you for good! Even they get their awesome present!&quot; jeered Hermie.<br />
Chad attempted to protest, rebelling against the fate he had been sentenced to but he didn’t even have time. Krampus waved the sleeping spell and Chad, now Cookie, was sound asleep, dead to the world in a warm and sweet slumber full of innocence. Krampus wasted no time in delivering him to his new overjoyed parents. Krampus himself felt warm and fuzzy. Punishing brats was fun but he lived for moments like this. Taking stupid human brats and turning them into bund.les of joy for his people to be raised right. And it worked too. He knew great characters amongst the species of his world which he knew he&#39;d delivered back decades or centuries ago. Those humans just didn&#39;t know how to raise kids and Krampus was more than happy to remedy to the situation, especially if it helped his own people.</p>
