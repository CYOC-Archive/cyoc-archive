<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The nearby buildings are all uniform warehouses. Nothing standing out, but there is luckily text above each door. Douglas reading them, trying to find which one might provide the most information... Infected Compartment? That&#39;s worrying... and a good opportunity to find out what&#39;s happening. Keeping to the walls as he goes north, blocked from sight by the gathering of lust driven orcs as he peaks through the glass window on the door. It&#39;s a square entry room with no one inside, there&#39;s cameras in the corner but it doesn&#39;t cover the entire room.<br />
<br />
As quick as he can, he twists the handle and rushes to the blindspot. The bland room having nothing but another door that leads further in. Though this one is metal and likely automated. Tightly sealed, which matches whatever an &#39;Infected Compartment&#39; would want. When given the opportunity, he goes to the door. It immediately opening to a tight room, with the same style of door on the opposite end. Which opens as the door he entered from closes.<br />
<br />
&quot;INTRUDER!&quot;<br />
<br />
On the other end of the door is an orc. A female that&#39;s just as brutish as her colleagues outside. Doug drawing his weapon, firing a dart into her chest as she charges forward. Her run turning to a limp as she continues to pursue. A second shot fired, landing in her shoulder as she finally collapses. Inches from the door as Douglas steps over her. Great, he was caught. Though based on the lack of other movement, maybe she was the only guard? The unconscious orc looks the same as the others outside, nude and wearing that strange bracelet. What is it?<br />
<br />
Taking his eyes off the monster, this room reminds him of an opened hospital. Rows of patient beds with blinds separating them from each other. Though there&#39;s no medical tools around. A few stands near each bed monitoring basic life functions, but nothing to actually assist a patient in need. What&#39;s worse however is the stench. It stinks of sex.<br />
<br />
Going to the nearest bed, he moves aside the blinds to look at the subject. It&#39;s an older man laying nude on the bed. Maybe 40 or so, almost passing for normal if not for the greenish hue of his skin or the tusks pressing out of his mouth. Halfway between man and orc with his body barely fitting on the bedframe. He has the same bracelet as the other orcs, which seems beyond tight on his large arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. Feel... Good...&quot;<br />
<br />
The man speaks to himself, eyes tightly closed as if asleep. His tusks gaining another inch in length and body expanding outwards. Skin taking on more of that green colouration, and bracelet remaining as tight as ever. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to know he&#39;s turning into an orc, so Douglas leaves him and goes to the other beds.<br />
<br />
Minotaurs, goblins, giants, anthropomorphic beasts, and many more. Some are even turning to stone and resembling gargoyles or golems. People are turning into mythological creatures before his eyes, each with the same tight bracelet and each in a daze. He remembers seeing the bull-like man stroke his dick as horns sprouted from his head. Or the lionness softly purring as she dipped a finger into her opening. They were all sex driven, and most of their beds stained by the aftermath. Doug thought that maybe this would be a good opportunity to learn about what&#39;s going on from the infected directly, though he&#39;d need to find someone who looks stable.<br />
<br />
Going through the remaining subjects, he stumbles upon a man that seems barely changed. His teeth seem sharp, and there&#39;s growth of brown fur across his chest, arms, and legs. But otherwise, he just looks like a guy in his early 20s. The agent seeming content with who he has found, examining the nearby devices for anything that might wake the subject up. Seeing the vital recordings having a few other options, one being a clear &#39;Wake&#39; which he presses.<br />
<br />
The subjects eyes suddenly open, though it&#39;s accompanied by a groan. Body adjusting to look at whoever woke him up, and surprise clear on his face as he sees Douglas. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Someone who isn&#39;t a part of this facility. Were you captured?&quot;<br />
&quot;Captured? Hah, nah. Just a researcher who screwed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, great. If there was anyone, he couldn&#39;t trust it was a researcher. Though he wasn&#39;t in uniform and had that strange bracelet on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You screwed up and they put you here? You&#39;re chipper for an unwilling subject.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I just got given an opportunity, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas grumbles, looking to the device. If he woke him up, he could probably put him back to sleep. Though the now worried voice of the former researcher greets him.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait! Wait! Don&#39;t put me back down! I&#39;ll help!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll help at a cost you mean.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well... yeah. Might as well. I want you to find the antidote before I turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two watch each other, Doug raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, should be simple enough. Where is it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Central office, tight security though.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can get through.&quot;<br />
&quot;Great! I&#39;m Mark. I got infected by a bugbear so look for that vaccine. If I fully turn it won&#39;t work anymore.&quot;<br />
&quot;Infected how?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was training a new bugbear when his bracelet broke. Before I knew it, I was sucking his cock and the orcs were pulling us apart. He didn&#39;t climax, but I got enough pre to start all of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s cheeks are bright red as he brings a hand to his now erect dick. Giving it a slow stroke as he continues to elaborate.<br />
<br />
&quot;It feels so good though. Starting to get fur. Starting to be stronger. Starting to be loyal. Fuck, I just want to keep going.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fur spreads as his strokes intensify. Now rapid rubbing done up and down his pole. Body enlarging and face becoming more bestial. Nose flattening and brows thickening.<br />
<br />
&quot;To be a bugbear... to be a monster...&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas wastes no more time as he goes to the vitals once more. Pressing the &#39;Sleep&#39; button as Marks eyes suddenly close and his head hits the pillow. Dick still pulsing even without his intervention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... strong... good...&quot;<br />
<br />
The agent takes a deep breath. A part of him feels sorry for Mark, but the rest of him remembers that this man was a researcher. He knew what he was getting into, though Douglas needs to get that antidote before this new subject finishes changing. <br />
<br />
Moving past the beds once more, he sees the door out, and a burly orc in front of it. Scarred face and broad bodied, probably the leader of this group of brutes. He&#39;s examining the currently unconscious orc, and quickly spots Douglas before he can hide.<br />
<br />
&quot;COWARD!&quot;<br />
<br />
He yells. Hand turning to a fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;I make strong. I fix. I make orc!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ready for more trouble, Douglas pulls out his gun and moves from the cover. Pointing his weapon at the orc and ready to fire, just as he realises the orc is about to fire himself. The greenskin rapidly stroking his cock, pointing it squarely at Douglas&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... Become... Orc!&quot;</p>
