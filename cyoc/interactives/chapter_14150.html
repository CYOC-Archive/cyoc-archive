<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A week later, Mark came to the group with another proposal for a lesson.  He made his pitch Tony, Jeff, Jack and Eric, with Claire there as well, in Tony's room.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, the guys who need a lesson are those five or six sophomores who always hang out at the park next to the ballet school&quot;<br />
&quot;Jeez&quot; snorted Eric &quot;does everybody bully you?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, it's not me.  I mean, they give me shit all the time, too.  But they intimidated another boy out of taking ballet anymore&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought you were the only one in the class&quot; said Jack<br />
&quot;No, well, I am again, now, but there was a twelve year old kid who'd just moved here who took ballet for about 3 months before he gave it up.  First they called him names, all the stupid shit you'd expect, gay, sissy, faggot, blah blah blah.  When the kid didn't back down, they started chasing him and beating him up any time he was walking home.  I heard they waited for him outside the junior high, too.  Anyway, the kid gave it up.  I'd like these guys to see what the other side is like&quot;<br />
&quot;You want them to be bullied?&quot; asked Tony.<br />
&quot;No.  I want them to take ballet for a month and to completely remember it afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire burst into carefree laughter.  &quot;That's perfect.  Not too brutal and how will they do anything later when the whole world knows they were spandex princes, too.  I've got some ideas about how you can do this&quot;<br />
<br />
The others agreed to let Mark go ahead with his plan.  He left the room and they debated what the price would be that Mark, himself would pay, according to their agreement to allow the use of the chronivac to teach a lesson only if the user had to endure a transformation as well.<br />
<br />
The next day, Mark went to his ballet class with the chronivac powered laptop in his backpack.  After class was over, Tony and Claire showed up to pick up Mark.  In the darkness outside the door, they could hear the six jerks laughing and shouting in the dirt area outside the jungle gym and merry go round.  Claire slowed her car to a stop at the nearest point of the road.  Mark pointed the laptop toward them and set it to scan.  1 . . 2 . . 3 . . 4 . . 5 . . 6.  All six had their existing profiles captured by the chronivac.<br />
&quot;What're you looking at, princess?&quot; sneered their leader, Stevie, a skinny, shaggy blond kid just a bit taller than Mark.<br />
&quot;I was just wondering which of you guys would dance which part in the school's next ballet recital&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!  Fuck you Marky girl!  Fuck you!&quot; shouted Stevie advancing on the car as the others laughed and spat expletives as well.  Claire just drove away from the curb and back to the St. Martins' house.  All three went up to Tony's room and spent the next 3 hours making detailed alterations to the profiles of all 6 in the profiles that they would be given.  First, they improved all their bodies to be perfectly suited for ballet.  <br />
&quot;They're all skinny fat&quot; laughed Claire.<br />
&quot;Skinny fat?&quot; asked a puzzled Mark.<br />
&quot;They're not wide or jiggly fat.  They're all skinny but they're all in lousy shape.  Not one of 'em has body fat below 16%.&quot;<br />
Claire changed that.  She made all 6 of them toned 15 year olds with 2% body fat.  Then she made some ballet specific modifications, more muscular calves, much better jumping ability and, grinning all the while, she reshaped their little asses to be almost as spectacular as Tony's and Mark's.  She gave them a little extra shoulder muscle and spent 15 minutes just making tiny alterations to perfect their skins.<br />
&quot;Jeez, you're really getting into this&quot; Tony chuckled<br />
&quot;Well, I've never had the chance to design boys before.  I'm not completely designing these boys, but I want them to be as good looking as possible.  They're gonna be in tights, after all, oh, and I want to suggest another change mentally.  Besides just making them want to take ballet&quot;<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wellllllll . . &quot; Claire typed away for a minute, &quot;I see natural registers on the homo to hetero scale of . . 80 . . 80 . . 90, definite girl lover there, 75 . . 85 . . and . . &quot; she laughed &quot;Oh, you're going to love this one, 50!&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, Mark.  I think at least one of the boys giving you a hard time resents being attracted to you.  It's a classic response.  He sees your fantastic body, your rock hard, round little ass and there's a moment when all he registers is a positive reaction.  Then he realizes that he's turned on by you and he hates that.  He displaces the hate onto you.  Like I said, it's a classic response.  I want to make them all bi's but we don't have to change anything about him&quot;<br />
&quot;Which one?&quot;<br />
&quot;Stevie Ontiveros, the leader&quot;<br />
Mark and Tony shared a laugh at the irony of it and let Claire go on with her psychological modifications to the six jerks.<br />
<br />
The next day, after ballet class, Mark again had the chronivac loaded laptop with him.  He powered up and went to the 4.0 program and walked outside with it in his bag.  He made his way to a trash can at the edge of the dirt area of the park.  Just a few steps away, the six were passing around a nearly finished joint.  Stevie hoarded the last few tokes, nearly burning his fingertips as he got the last possible inhale.  He let the roach drop to the ground at the site of Mark.<br />
&quot;Oh, look&quot; he said still inhaling &quot;it's princess&quot;<br />
&quot;Hi, Stevie&quot; said Mark and he hit the 'enter' key.  All 6 15 year old boys shuddered or flinched at the electric wave from the emitter passing through them.<br />
&quot;Ow! What the hell was that?&quot; asked Tommy, the one redhead.  As Mark watched, they all seemed to be changing at different paces and starting in different ways.  The tallest of the four brunettes kept rubbing the seat of his pants.  Another flexed his shoulders over and over.  Stevie jabbed one hand into his shirt and rubbed suddenly washboard abs.  <br />
&quot;Why don't you guys show up at 3 o'clock tomorrow and take ballet class?&quot; Mark innocently asked.  There was a long pause.  They looked at each other with expressions that were non-committal but amenable.<br />
&quot;Okay&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll give it a try&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure, me too&quot;<br />
<br />
The next day, at 3 o'clock, the ballet school's instructor was shocked and delighted to find she had not just Mark, but 6 more boys in her class.  Six somewhat sheepish boys entered with Mark and presented checks to her for the cost of 3 months of classes.  She couldn't tell just what kind of dancers they would be.  All six were in the range from 5'8&quot; like Mark to 5'11&quot;.  It was hard to tell under their baggy jeans and t-shirts if they had any muscles, but at least they weren't fat.  And all 6 had tights, leotards, slippers and dance belts thanks to Claire having programmed their new profiles to change half their underwear to ballet wear.<br />
&quot;Mark, why don't you take the other boys into the, um, locker room?&quot;<br />
Locker room was a grandiose term for the boys' changing area into which Mark led them.  It was an open rectangular room 18 feet long and 10 feet wide with two shower heads and a tiled floor and wall on the 4 feet at one end.  Mark led them inside and closed the door behind them.  He quickly stripped and showed them how to put on a dance belt and then their white leotard tops and black tights.  One after another, he yanked their tights up and rolled the waistband top tightly in place.  He rolled his eyes at Claire's handiwork.  Six sets of buns of steel attached to slender athletic boys.  And Claire's cosmetic work was remarkable as well.  All had flawless skin, perfect hair and blindingly white, straight teeth.  As remarkable as that change, the changes in their attitudes were even more amazing.  They cheerfully joked with Mark that they were uncoordinated even though Claire had given them amazing coordination.  Out on the bouncy hardwood floor, they tried a few jumps and jokingly picked each other up as though they were partnering each other.  They didn't mind when all the girls came out and saw them in their tights.  Some of the girls were astounded to see these particular boys in ballet class.  &quot;Stevie Ontiveros!&quot;  &quot;Tommy O'Leary!  Oh my god&quot;  The room filled with laughter.<br />
<br />
But the new dancers took their task quite seriously.  At the instructor's suggestion, the six of them lined up behind Mark at the barre and doing other exercises and tried to copy everything Mark did, every pointed toe, every turned out hip.  They couldn't quite match Mark's flexibility, technique and leaping but they weren't far behind.  To boys who were so athletic, it was fun, a lot of fun.  And even bisexual boys could certainly enjoy carrying scantily clad girls over their heads and around the floor.  <br />
<br />
At the end of class, Mark led them back into the boys' changing room.  There was a feeling in the air of being teammates.  Back slaps and unselfconscious pats of each other's rear went all around.  It wasn't any different from how Mark remembered the 12 year olds' junior league football locker rooms.<br />
<br />
It went that way day after day.  The six boys saw themselves as dancers.  That was part of their identity.  Two weeks into their introduction to ballet, a photographer for the local paper took a series of photos of them that appeared on the front page of the paper and accompanying the continued article inside.  Now the whole town knew they were ballet dancers!  They found other boys mocking them as sissies and all the other things they'd said to Mark.<br />
<br />
But there was some truth to it in their case.  The two shortest brunette boys had obviously become a couple, at least an experimental one.  The redheaded boy and another one were a bit more discreet but they seemed to have been intensely interested in each other at one point.  That was followed by the two not wanting to have anything to do with each other just days later.<br />
<br />
The most surprising, to Mark, was Stevie Ontiveros.  The vandal, truant, delinquent who'd constantly given him shit just a month before hung around with Mark to help the instructor set up chairs for the audience at the next night's performance.  He waited till Mark had peeled off his tights to shower and approached Mark from behind.  Mark felt his hands on him, spinning Mark around and was shocked to then find Stevie's mouth covering his.<br />
&quot;Mmmmpphhhh!&quot;<br />
Stevie's tongue lapped over his and then swirled around Mark's mouth.  <br />
<br />
Jeez.  I didn't want him to be my enemy, but this is too far the other way!<br />
<br />
But Stevie didn't stop there.  He pushed Mark back against the wall and while Mark was trying to regain his balance, took Mark's long soft cock and his hand and stroked feverishly till Mark started becoming erect.<br />
&quot;Hey!  Don't do that!&quot;<br />
But Stevie had other ideas.  Almost as though it was a dance step he'd practiced, Stevie pushed Mark's shoulders back and pulled his waist forward.  With his toes on top of Mark's, Stevie mimicked a thrusting motion moving up and down to rub his completely erect penis against Mark's half erect phallus.<br />
&quot;Mmmm, mmmmmmm, mmmmmmmm!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; At last Mark got free of Stevie, stumbling over their backpacks and a chair in the process.  &quot;What's the matter with you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh come on.  We're ballet dancers . . &quot;chuckled Stevie as though that should be enough.<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's right.  And I'm a straight one&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!  But . . but . .?  I mean, so what?  Does that girl Zoe put out for you?  Does she understand what things are like for a guy?&quot;<br />
&quot;She's . . well, she doesn't try and jam me&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll be the bottom!&quot;<br />
&quot;Whoa.  Stop right there.  This isn't going to happen.  I guess I should say thank you for the compliment of your interest, but I'm straight.  Thanks anyway, but I'm straight&quot;<br />
Stevie seemed disappointed, but at the same time, acknowledging his sexual interest in Mark seemed to be quite a relief for him.  After the month was up, only one of the six boys stayed in the ballet class.  Stevie and the others left both him and Mark alone and didn't bother them.</p>
