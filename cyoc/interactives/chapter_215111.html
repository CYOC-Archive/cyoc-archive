<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Aaron?” John asked, eyes wide as he took a tentative step back.<br />
<br />
The feeling of euphoria that had been flowing through Aaron’s body started to fade; he felt as if he were coming out of a trance, noticing his changes for the first time. He glanced down at his new beefy body, flexing his bulging biceps in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“What the hell happened to me, babe?” Aaron asked, pulling open one of the lockers to look at his own reflection. He saw Coach Ryerson’s nearly nude body staring back from the mirror.<br />
<br />
“I…uh…I don’t know,” John tried to hide his raging hard on in his boxer briefs, not wanting his boyfriend to know how much his new appearance was turning him on.<br />
<br />
“You turned me into your coach!” Aaron shouted, shooting John an accusing look.<br />
<br />
“What? No! I didn’t do anything. It must have been the jock strap,” John nodded at the tight pouch hugging Aaron’s crotch.<br />
<br />
Aaron glanced down at the black jockstrap he was wearing. He could clearly see the outline of his cock through the material; a large area of the pouch was damp from where his dick was leaking precum. He looked back at his reflection in the mirror, feeling as if he must be dreaming. “This is taking your role play fantasy a bit too far, John.”<br />
<br />
“I’m really sorry, babe,” John replied, “I have no idea how this happened, honestly.” He couldn’t help but admire Aaron’s rearside, John’s eyes lingering on Aaron’s round but muscled ass.<br />
<br />
“Well, what the hell are we going to do now?” <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
At the same time, Coach Ryerson was finishing up his lesson plans for the following week in his office. As he logged off his computer, he heard a knock at the door to see another member of the coaching staff, Coach Harris, standing before him.<br />
<br />
“All done for the week?” Coach Harris asked.<br />
<br />
“Thankfully. What a long week,” Ryerson groaned, standing up from behind his desk and slinging his satchel bag over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Want to a grab a pint at the bar before heading home? I’d say we’ve earned it,” Harris offered.<br />
<br />
Ryerson opened his mouth to reply when a strange feeling washed over him. He let out an involuntary shudder as his limbs started to tingle, his skin feeling electric. Noticing his distress, Harris took a step toward Ryerson in concern.<br />
<br />
“You all right, man?” Harris asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah,” Ryerson answered reassuringly, “Just a little dizzy spell. It’ll pass.”<br />
<br />
Ryerson glanced down as his arms continued to pulse with energy. The dark brown hairs along his forearms were lightening to blonde and slowly retracting back into his skin. Ryerson was sure his eyes must be deceiving him; he tried to quell the urge to panic.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you’re all right? You look like you just saw a ghost,” Harris frowned, crossing his arms and looking on suspiciously.<br />
<br />
“I’ll catch up to you at the bar,” Ryerson shouted as he fled from his office, racing past Harris. He practically ran down the school hallway, trying to find a private area where he could collect his thoughts and get a hold of himself. Looking downwards, he noted his forearms and biceps weren’t as quite as defined as they had been moments before, almost appearing as if he was shedding muscle. His shoulders seemed a bit slimmer as well, his polo now a bit baggy around his torso.<br />
<br />
Ryerson threw open the door to the changeroom and hurried in, slamming the door shut and locking it behind him. <br />
<br />
“Coach?” He heard a voice call out from behind him. Ryerson spun around to see John, one of his students. Behind John, he could see a man that looked like his doppelganger. Ryerson was confident he was losing his mind by this point, rubbing his eyes in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Is that…me?” Ryerson asked slowly, pointing at his doppelganger.<br />
<br />
John exchanged a look with Ryerson’s doppelganger, the two of them having an unspoken conversation. After an extended pause, John finally answered. “It’s actually Aaron. He turned into you… we’re not sure why.”<br />
<br />
John glanced back at Ryerson, his eyebrows rising as he noticed Ryerson’s changes for the first time. “Are you feeling okay? You look a little…different.”<br />
<br />
Ryerson glanced down at his body. His torso continued to slim down, remaining toned but slender. His beefy pecs had deflated, leaving him flat chested. His hard muscle gut sunk in, leaving him with a tight smooth stomach. Ryerson pulled the now oversize polo off to better inspect his changing chest, watching in fascination as the dark hairs covering his chest and stomach lightened and grew sparse.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is happening to me?” Ryerson asked, his voice cracking to become softer and boyish. His stomach continued to tighten until he had the faint definition of abs; by no means did he look like a jock, but he had the upper body of someone who took care of themselves. Ryerson’s waist narrowed which resulted in his pants sliding down to his ankles, revealing a jockstrap identical to the one Aaron was wearing. <br />
<br />
“I think you’re becoming me,” Aaron replied, slowly stroking his hard cock in arousal through his pouch. John was also rubbing himself through his briefs as he watched his crush turn into his boyfriend. Ryerson’s quads and thighs slimmed down; his scrawny legs were not enough to support the jockstrap and it fell down to his knees, exposing his erect member.<br />
<br />
“Fuck this feel so good,” Ryerson panted, starting to jerk himself. His round, muscled butt firmed up, losing some padding and growing bonier. His short dark hair grew lighter and longer, curling into a messy hairstyle as his stubble vanished. Ryerson’s square jaw rounded out, his handsome face regressing to that of a teenager. <br />
<br />
Ryerson’s entire body started to spasm as his cock erupted, spurting out a thick stream of cum. As he orgasmed, Ryerson’s massive dick began to shrink, growing thinner and shorter with every spurt of cum he released. His ballsack contracted, his testicles shriveling down in size and finalizing his transformation into Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Now,” Ryerson gasped breathlessly, admiring his new teenage body in the mirror, “Will someone please tell me what the hell is going on?”</p>
