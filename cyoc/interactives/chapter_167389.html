<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Truth be told, Sam hadn&#39;t spent so much as a moment considering where she wanted to go with Harley. She hadn&#39;t even really expected to talk to her again - but here she was, with one of the witch&#39;s arms draped over her shoulder, her body leaning a bit closer to the amazing form she&#39;d just been given. It was a little hard to breathe, let alone try and figure out a suitable activity for a first date. Especially when she&#39;d never even gone on a date before, or been asked out on one, or asked anyone out to one, or even considered what an actual date would be like.<br />
<br />
So, she blurted out the first thing that came to mind. &quot;Uh... you wanna just... hang out... play some games?&quot; She winced instantly at how awful that sounded, but her haggard reply and wrinkled face only seemed to draw amusement out of Harley. The finger that had been on her collarbone tapped against her forehead, and she suddenly felt a small burst of information enter her mind. 10 digits, an address - Harley&#39;s address, and her phone number. Oh god, the girl she had a crush on had just given Sam her number. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds fun.&quot; She backed away, smiling wickedly at Sam. &quot;Swing by my place Friday night. Until then, hot stuff...&quot; Lifting one hand, she blew a kiss to the lovesick nerd - and she could have sworn she felt a pair of lips briefly press against her cheek, causing her red-hot blush to become a pair of supernovas on her cheeks.<br />
<br />
It was, of course, only Monday, but the rest of the week... well, it was pretty nice, compared to her usual week. It hadn&#39;t taken her long at all to get accustomed to walking around with her new body, though getting used to all the people dropping their jaws when they saw her took a bit longer. So many boys and girls alike were suddenly paying a great deal of attention to her - and as odd as that had been at first, she was kind of liking it. It probably helped that her clothes now seemed to adjust themselves to fit her snugly, showing off the full glamor of her new curves... although the inability of any top she wore to not show off some impressive cleavage was slightly concerning. More of Harley&#39;s magic at work, she assumed.<br />
<br />
True to the punkish girl&#39;s word, Katelyn had shown up to class looking like her normal self the next day. She had even managed to retain most of her bitchiness... at least, until she saw Sam. Any time she passed the asian girl with her entourage, Sam would merely smile and wave, taking just a bit of sadistic joy in the look of horror that would always cross the blonde&#39;s face. She hadn&#39;t bothered Sam once since that night, having apparently learned some kind of lesson from her temporary obesity - or at the very least, she was too terrified to screw with the girl who&#39;d stolen her smoking hot body.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d even gotten to talk to Harley a little bit, much to her joy - they were already at the point of hanging out during lunch. Well, talk to her was a bit of misnomer - Harley usually just sat there, in her cool, badass, detatched above-it-all way, reading some book or another while Sam just sat there admiring her. Every now and then, she&#39;d look up and smirk, causing Sam&#39;s heart to skip a few beats. Even with a lack of conversation, the consistent companionship, just having some company? That was nice. Really, really nice. <br />
<br />
When the big night finally came, she had already done plenty of prep work. A whole heap of snacks and drinks were in her car as she drove out to Harley&#39;s house, her favorite console and games packed up in the backseat, all her homework caught up in case she didn&#39;t get to work on it this weekend. Honestly... she didn&#39;t have any clue what this date was going to be like, but god help her if she wasn&#39;t as excited as she&#39;d ever been.<br />
<br />
On pulling her junker into the driveway, she paused to take one final stock of herself. She&#39;d dressed up nicely, she thought; her nicest red blouse was hugging her torso, after she&#39;d given up the fight to hide her cleavage, with a black skirt that was a fair bit shorter simply from having more rear end to cover now. Between that and some cute black heels was actual pantyhose - she&#39;d never worn the stuff, thinking it would look awful on her fat legs, but on her now-slender body... she hoped Harley would find them to be as nice as she did. Freshly-cleaned glasses and a neat bun for her dark hair, still effortlessly clean and tidy, completed the look - maybe a bit much for just hanging out to play games, but she figured a first date deserved some degree of effort.<br />
<br />
She had just stepped out when she looked at the doorway and saw Harley already heading down to greet her. An approving moan left the witch&#39;s mouth as she looked over her date, leaning up against Sam&#39;s car with a delighted glint in her eyes. &quot;Mmm... somebody sure appreciates their new body. I like.&quot;<br />
<br />
It seemed like blushing was her default state around Harley, and this moment was no exception. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said quietly, wringing her wrist. &quot;I uh, I brought some stuff, shouldn&#39;t take me long to bring in-&quot;<br />
<br />
Right in the middle of her sentence, Harley snapped her fingers, and a bright light appeared within her car. When the rainbow burst faded, everything had vanished, snacks, drinks, console, all of it. She began to open her mouth to ask what Harley had done, but she quickly came to a conclusion on her own. &quot;...witches don&#39;t carry things inside, do they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not when they can teleport it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A breathless laugh passed Sam&#39;s lips. &quot;Right. Uh... I guess... we should head inside, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her date nodded, quickly taking her hand in a light grasp as she led them into the house, shutting the door behind them with a wave of her hand. The inside was kind of startling to Sam, just beacuse it was so... well... normal. She had expected all sorts of weird and witchy things, like some sort of high-tier haunted house, cauldrons bubbling, spellbooks glowing, that sort of thing. But it was, apparently, a pretty standard modern home - even the paintings looked like the sort of thing you&#39;d see at an open house, rather than macabre or dire imagery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry the place is so boring,&quot; Harley said, apologizing for the first time that Sam had ever heard as she led them to a couch in front of a decent-sized television. &quot;It&#39;s a rental. If I owned this place it&#39;d be way cooler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ah... I bet.&quot; Her brow furrowed slightly. &quot;Witches... rent houses?&quot; <br />
<br />
She plopped down onto the couch with a bemused grin, dragging Sam down to sit next to her. &quot;I know, I know, but trust me - conjuring up cash to pay rent is way, way cheaper than creating a whole lair out of scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Huh. That kind of made sense. &quot;You must be pretty good at the whole... magic... thing, though, right? I mean...&quot; She gestured to her body. &quot;This is... really... yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though she&#39;d finally let go of Sam&#39;s hand, Harley&#39;s gaze never wavered from the other girl&#39;s eyes. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m good alright. Best Child Witch in Texas, three years in a row. I kicked ass with and without a wand.&quot; She gestured to several awards placed on a shelf, little plastic cauldron trophies painted a golden color - the witchy version of little league trophies, she imagined.<br />
<br />
&quot;In Texas?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have actual witchcraft awards, and you latched onto the Texas part?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean... it&#39;s Texas.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fair.&quot; She giggled. &quot;I grew up in Houston. Real big witch scene there, lots of people who like to fuck with the stupid hick locals.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;Got sick of the heat though. So I came up here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam dragged a pillow over, pulling it against her stomach. It wasn&#39;t quite intentional when it ended up pushing up her chest, but she doubted Harley was going to complain. &quot;Yeah. Southern California&#39;s pretty hot too. Was kinda glad, coming out here... New England is a lot cooler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cali, huh?&quot; She leaned an arm against the back of the sofa, her gaze momentarily drawn to Sam&#39;s bosom before she looked her in the eye again. &quot;So how come you&#39;re way up here?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed softly. &quot;Mom and dad... they... sent me here. Said that their daughter was going to an Ivy League school, and that was that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must have good money then, if they can afford to have you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah. Dad&#39;s a doctor, mom&#39;s an engineer. They uh...&quot; She rubbed the back of her neck. &quot;They... argued, a lot... about which one I&#39;d study to be. Dad won, but... they still argue sometimes, about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harley made a quick time-out motion. &quot;Back up. Where were you in all that arguing?&quot; Sam shrugged, but that didn&#39;t seem like enough of an answer for her. &quot;So what... they didn&#39;t even ask what you wanted to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... not... really...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well fuck that noise.&quot; She reached out and laid a hand over Sam&#39;s. &quot;What do you want to do? And don&#39;t even tell me you wanna do whatever your parents think is best - just tell me, top of your head, bottom of your heart, what would you do if you could do anything at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t really a question anyone had ever asked her - but for once an answer came easy. It just had to be prefaced by a question. &quot;Promise you won&#39;t uh... you won&#39;t... tell me it&#39;s dumb?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...&quot; she shrugged slightly. &quot;I... kinda always thought, it&#39;d be fun to uh... explore.&quot; She winced, already able to hear the shamed shouting from her parents at the back of her mind. &quot;Like uh... I-I really like adventure books, see... and I always thought, it&#39;d be really cool, to just go... see what&#39;s out there. What&#39;s... out in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harley&#39;s eyes softened. &quot;That&#39;s the least dumb thing I ever heard.&quot; She reached up with her other hand to brush at Sam&#39;s hair. &quot;I bet you&#39;d be a total badass at it. Discovering shit, fighting bad guys, loving ladies all badass Asian Girl Captain Kirk style.&quot;<br />
<br />
A laugh sputted out of Sam. &quot;Oh yeah, compare the Asian girl to the guy with the yellow uniform, real nice,&quot; she said playfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright, jeez, you can be Riker!&quot; She laughed more heartily this time, scooting a bit closer. &quot;God, one week with a breathtaking rack, and she&#39;s already getting sassy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t like sassy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I adore sassy, and if you stop, I will be livid.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile crept up her lips. She&#39;d never had this kind of attitude with anyone... but Harley made it so easy. Talking to her, joking with her, it was the most natural thing in the whole world. &quot;I might have to stop, then. You&#39;re probably super cute when you get mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sassy, and devious.&quot; She sighed. &quot;There&#39;s really only one thing I can do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a single smooth motion, she leaned in, crushing her lips to Sam&#39;s. To say it caught her off guard was an understatement - she had no goddamn idea how to respond, what to do when being kissed. All she could do was what seemed natural: close her eyes, lean back, and let Harley assault her mouth with that excited tongue. Her own lips parted, allowing the witch to probe deep as she pushed her down, her body falling on top of Sam&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;We uh...&quot; she said, breathless, when the kiss briefly broke, &quot;Weren&#39;t we gonna... play... games...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re playing, hot stuff,&quot; she whispered into Sam&#39;s ear before resuming the kiss. Harley&#39;s hands quickly wound their way up her sides as they made out, feeling the way her body curved all the way up to that incredible chest now smooshed against her own. Her kiss broke, but lips continued to trace down Sam&#39;s skin to her breasts, held in place by a pair of strong hands as Harley buried her face between them. She moaned loudly, an arm resting on her forehead as pleasurable feelings she&#39;d only dreamed of began to blossom inside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Harley...&quot; They were really doing this. It was overwhelming to even consider, and in her increasingly breathless state, she could manage only one request. &quot;Please...&quot;</p>
