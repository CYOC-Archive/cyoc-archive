<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hunter Reynolds never managed to lie down on his towel, nor did anyone notice the muscular man apparently vanishing into thin air. The bright red speedo he had been wearing fell into the sand, barely making a sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;(Ouch! What just fell on me? Some kind of red circus tent? It&#39;s huge and it reeks of locker room!)&quot; Hunter thought to himself, none the wiser. He wondered why it was so difficult for him to move his muscles. He felt rigid and... hard...<br />
<br />
A little boy holding a bucket and shovel started crying. Not to the disappearance of the cocky stud but to lament the loss of his perfectly constructed sandcastle. He had spent the last hour adding all sorts of precise details to it but it was now in ruins; his castle had been demolished by a mean monster in a red speedo.<br />
<br />
The sentient remains of the sandcastle needless to say was also quite pissed at its mistreatment, but John no longer had a voice to complain with. Not like having his body stabbed by the kid&#39;s shovel was any better than this, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Benny! What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Asked the boy&#39;s father Tom, a fat man with a big hairy gut who had been eating a sandwich just moments ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! A meanie man crushed my castle!&quot; The kid complained. &quot;He&#39;s a big ogre of a monster!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; The big man crunched his knuckles, furious that a full grown man had bullied his son. &quot;Tell me who it was, I&#39;ll give him a piece of my mind and maybe crush a few of his bones in return.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter overheard their conversation and got scared shitless. He wanted to get up and run but he couldn&#39;t move. Hunter hoped the angry dad wouldn&#39;t notice him under this weird big red tent that had fallen on top of him. He wished he could disappear, completely unaware this particular wish had already become a reality. <br />
<br />
Benny ran towards where Hunter had placed his towel, but was surprised at what he saw. &quot;Uh? The mean ogre was here! I&#39;m sure of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The obese father scanned the are with his killer stare but he only found Hunter&#39;s red speedo, discarded there on the sand as if his owner had suddenly decided to go skinny dipping. &quot;This beach is full of perverts and assholes.&quot; He murmured to himself.<br />
<br />
But then he noticed that the red piece of swimwear had a very obvious bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the?!&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t unusual to find bulges in tight speedos... But this one wasn&#39;t being worn! And on top of that, it was obscenely huge.<br />
<br />
Hunter wondered why he was so hard. It was like his whole body was as rigid as an XXXL dildo. He wanted to move and get out from under the tent, but not only was movement impossible, even the slightest touch felt like his sensitive erection was being manhandled.<br />
<br />
Tom gulped. Could it be that this pervert had brought a dildo to the beach? The nerve!<br />
<br />
Making sure his son was looking elsewhere, Tom reached down with a trembling hand and lifted up the red speedo...<br />
<br />
Hunter wanted to scream. The red tent had been lifted and what he saw was a fucking giant! A big huge fat giant clad in blue swim trunks!<br />
<br />
Hunter felt exposed and naked, especially considering his rock-hard erection. He felt so ashamed he wanted the sand to swallow him whole.<br />
<br />
The angry fat dad surprisingly just laughed very hard at the absurdity of the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, here I was all worried for nothing... After all, you&#39;re just an insignificant seashell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;(What...?)&quot; If Hunter could look at himself he&#39;d just see a coral-colored seashell. An inanimate, simple, insignificant object perfectly blended in the beach environment. Considering his rigidness and quite phallic shape, it was no wonder Tom had gotten the wrong idea when he had seen the unfortunately-placed Hunter.<br />
<br />
Tom grabbed the scared seashell and inspected it with his hands. &quot;I gotta say, with your sturdy big size you&#39;d satisfy the desires of... A hermit crab, I suppose. Hehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hunter&#39;s coral-colored surface couldn&#39;t get any redder but he felt embarrassed as hell that this ugly fat man was touching his hard phallus-shaped body. This isn&#39;t what he had planned for today at all! He was a muscle stud, he wanted to show off his muscles! He didn&#39;t want to be a puny little inanimate object!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing cutie-pie, just talking to myself.&quot; Tom replied. Not like he was actually talking to an inanimate seashell, after all.<br />
<br />
Hunter&#39;s mind was racing. How could this have happened? This could only mean the inanimate virus was real and he had caught it! &quot;(Oh shit, I&#39;m a fucking seashell! How come I&#39;m still able to feel and think?! That&#39;s not what the TV reports about the virus said!)&quot; It was true that he always acted like a dick but that wasn’t to mean that he deserved to become a dick-shaped seashell for the rest of his existence, right?<br />
<br />
Tom was about to throw the former man turned seashell back into the sand as he had no use for such an useless thing. Hunter however was pleading with all his might that the fat dad or anyone for that matter would help him.<br />
<br />
&quot;(Please, someone, help me! I&#39;m a person! I&#39;m a human being!)&quot; Hunter, now reduced to a pathetic shell of his former self, cried again and again. Not like the equivalent of a sea rock had any possibility of communication...</p>
