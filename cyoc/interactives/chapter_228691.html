<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">McKenzie. or Kenz to her friends sat on the couch in her apartment. It was Friday night and normally she&#39;d be out on the town. Except she was newly on her own, paying rent, bills, and finally adulting. As such, her cash flow was low and she didn&#39;t have the inclination to linger at the bar trying to flirt guys into buying her drinks. Her friends were all either busy or off doing their own things. This left Kenz to do the only thing left to her. Cheap Chinese take out from the place down the block and whatever happened to be on TV.<br />
<br />
What happened to be on TV was a movie she had seen plenty of times, so while that played in the background she ate her dinner with one hand and scrolled on her phone with the other. Even the posts on social media seemed boring today, until she came across one put up by one of her favorite erotica writers.<br />
<br />
=Design a guy for my next story! Just fill out this questionnaire in a repost and I might include your character in my next story! Remember, the more detailed you can be, the better!=<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were a guy, huh?&quot; Kenz put her bowl down on the coffee table and skimmed the questions, an idea formulated in her head. She had a particular type of smut she liked to read, and it was her secret fantasy to sometimes picture herself in a very particular role. &quot;Why not? If she picks it I&#39;ll at least get a story about something I like to read.&quot; She mused, and these writing prompts were always fun.<br />
<br />
=Question 1: If you were a guy... would your handwriting be neater?=<br />
<br />
It was an odd first question. =About as neat.= She started, Kenz actually had some very neat handwriting, but it was also distinctly feminine. =More masculine, though, blockier letters, but still able to write in cursive.= She likes her guys to be classy and cultured, and being able to write in cursive seemed like it fit well.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t notice as her hands began to get a little larger and more square. Her fingers getting thicker and longer as her manicured and painted nails became short and unadorned.<br />
<br />
=Question 2: If you were a guy... would you still like pink?=<br />
<br />
=A real man is confident enough to enjoy pink.= Kenz always found it silly, assigning colors like that. She though a nice pink top looked good on a man, and was a great color to go with black. So far, not the type of questions she had been expecting.<br />
<br />
Around her, her apartment shifted about. Decor and furniture shifting slightly. Her television blipped as the stand it was on became a larger entertainment console, with speakers and some video game consoles. Soft rounded furniture became a bit blockier. Their colors didn&#39;t shift a whole lot though. In one corner an electric guitar in hot pink appeared, with an accompanying amp.<br />
<br />
=Question 3: If you were a guy... would your hair be straight or curly?=<br />
<br />
Kenz had curlier hair and she hated it, especially in the summer, but straight hair was so boring. She chewed her lip for a moment as she thought. =A very slight curl. And I&#39;d keep it short enough so it was more wavy than curly, combed back and neatly coiffed.=<br />
<br />
Her curly brown hair lifted from her shoulders as it retreated into her scalp, losing some of its curl as it went. The hair by her ears and on the nape of her neck became distinctly short, while it remained a few inches long atop her head. She ran her fingers through it unconsciously, pushing it back out of her face.<br />
<br />
=Question 4: If you were a guy... what would be your favorite color?=<br />
<br />
Kenz smiled, already inspired by a previous question. =Why not pink?= She grinned, as a few more pops of pink appeared around the room she was sitting on. A few bright pink throw pillows on her black couch, and a rug in various tones of red including pinks. Even a framed vintage poster of a 1950s pink Cadillac.<br />
<br />
=Question 5: If you were a guy... what color would your hair be?=<br />
<br />
This one Kenz didn&#39;t even have to think about. =Black. Not just dark brown, but black.= She loved the way dark hair looked on guys, and the darker the better, except for one little thing, but that could be added later. Appearance questions were going to be easier, she had a very clear image in her mind.<br />
<br />
Her brown hair deepened to a deep and glossy black that stood out sharply against her pale skin. Her brows thickened as they darkened as well, loosing their carefully sculpted arch as they grew thicker. Even her lashes got a touch longer and darker, the mascara she had put on that morning and not cleaned off after coming home from work vanishing.<br />
<br />
=Question 6: If you were a guy... what color would your eyes be?=<br />
<br />
=Blue, icy blue. Pale against the black hair.= It was a combination she loved. Pale blue eyes that stood out stark in comparison to that deep black hair.<br />
<br />
Her already blue eyes lightened, to a blue so pale it could almost be called gray. The rest of her makeup began to fade as her features began to shift. Her forehead widened as her brows became more prominent. Her nose growing larger as well, losing any daintiness it once had. Her chin and jaw squared off, as her round face shifted geometry. She retained her high cheek bones, but they looked quite different on her broader face.<br />
<br />
=Question 7: If you were a guy... would you like to work out?=<br />
<br />
=Regularly. Gotta keep fit and muscular. Not to bodybuilder extremes, but keeping nice and toned, especially in the chest and arms, but can&#39;t skip leg day.= She laughed softly at that last part. She&#39;d dated too many guys in college with chicken legs that didn&#39;t look like they could support their upper bodies.<br />
<br />
Her own body was becoming flush with toned muscle. Her arms and legs, once slender and thin becoming thick and burly.  Her biceps and triceps popped as she held her phone up, her clothing straining against the new growth and threatening to tear apart, but somehow keeping together. Her breasts didn&#39;t seem to shrink away, rather they just seemed to change shape under her tight shirt, going from soft round mammaries to thick angular pectorals, her bra just vanishing below her too tight shirt. The impression of her nipples on the fabric quickly shrank down to a fraction of their size. Her shorts could no longer fit over her muscled thighs, bunching up above the tone leg muscle. <br />
<br />
=Question 8: If you were a guy... would you be sporty?=<br />
<br />
=I&#39;d be an outdoorsy type. Not really into sports in a crazy way, but enjoying running, swimming, and hiking. Probably camping, too.= Sure, Kenz liked refined guys, but she also liked them a little rugged. Get you a guy that can do both, she&#39;d tell her friends. Not out of place at a nice party, but also able to start a fire and cook on a grill.<br />
<br />
Her pale skin tanned as if she regularly spent time in the sun, though there were some tan lines along her legs that the bunched up shorts showed off. Her hands became a bit calloused as if used to being worked with.<br />
<br />
=Question 9: If you were a guy... what kind of shoes would you wear?=<br />
<br />
Well, that was a weird question, though no odder than the color ones she guessed. =Depends on the situation, though if left a choice, boots or sandals when not working out, depending on the weather.= The clothes in her closet began to vanish, as did her collection of shoes, including the few by the door. A pair of running shoes popped into existence, along with a pair of sandals. A few different boots appeared in her closet, a sturdy work pair, a hiking pair, and a nicer pair for just wearing around.<br />
<br />
Her dainty feet suddenly expanded, growing a couple of sizes in a sudden burst, her painted nails, like on her hands, vanishing.<br />
<br />
=Question 10: If you were a guy... would you like suits?=<br />
<br />
She thought on this for a moment. =Not for everyday wear, but definitely once in a while I&#39;d like to dress up for a nice event. Though I&#39;d make sure I didn&#39;t have frumpy suits. I&#39;d spend some money on the tailoring to make sure it showed off my shoulders, and my nice butt.= She giggled again, though in a slightly deeper register than she had a moment ago. A guy had to have nice ass.<br />
<br />
Her own frame became suddenly broader in the shoulders, stretching her poor shirt past the breaking point as it tore down the front exposing her muscled chest and flat stomach. The sleeves, like the legs of her shorts, bunched up between her delts and biceps. Her waist thickened as her hips narrowed, her figure becoming a distinct V-shape. Amazingly, her rear grew a bit more plump, a rounded and muscular bubble but that would look great in almost any pair of pants.<br />
<br />
In her closet a few nice suits popped into being, thought the rest of the closet filled with more casual clothing, and a few work out outfits.<br />
<br />
=Question 11: If you were a guy... would you be manly?=<br />
<br />
=Definitely. But not aggressively so. Confident, but not bossy. The sort of guy that can command attention but doesn&#39;t need it.=<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a hard one.&quot; Kenz muttered to herself, her voice now deep and slightly gravelly. She didn&#39;t notice as she changes the way she was sitting, leaning back with one arm along the back of the couch, one leg crossed over the other as she lounged easily, exuding a subtle but unmistakable confidence.<br />
<br />
=Question 12: If you were a guy... what size would your ‘equipment’ be?=<br />
<br />
If she were a guy? What would any guy say? =Impressive, but not comically big, more girthy than overly long. With an impressive set of balls.= After a moment she added. =And uncut.=<br />
<br />
A bulge began to form in the front of Kenz&#39;s strained shorts, making them and her panties give way as a growing cock flopped free. Still soft it grew to a thick five inches, and her scrotum plumped up as her balls dropped a couple decades late. Without thinking she reached down and fondled her cock, the image forming in her head of this perfect guy was starting to get her going. Her foreskin rolled back as he erection swelled, and eight inch cock, thick as a beer bottle resting in her hands. She thought of pausing this little writing experiment to go take care of herself, but she was more than halfway through, besides, more ideas would help with her fapping.<br />
<br />
=Question 13: If you were a guy... would you be into girls?=<br />
<br />
This was where Kenz&#39;s particular taste in erotica came in. She liked reading certain stories. =Not usually.= She wrote, grinning as she thought about it. =I&#39;d definitely be more into men. I&#39;d be the top, but I&#39;d prefer men more like me. Fit, manly, maybe a bit jockish. But younger, and cute wouldn&#39;t hurt.=<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, this was definitely going to help. She could already imagine sinking her cock into the plump ass of some subby gym rat. But not too subby, no one that would simper for her. No, she wanted sex to almost be like wrestling, where she had to prove she was the dominant one and in control. Rough and wild. She licked her lips thinking about it.<br />
<br />
=Question 14: If you were a guy... would you shave?=<br />
<br />
=Real men have hair.= She put down. =And beards.= She didn&#39;t get all the obsession with smooth men. There was something about a nice pelt on a guy that let you know he was a guy. =But keeping it trimmed and groomed is a must.= <br />
<br />
Dark pubic hair began to grow out from he once neatly shaved crotch, though it stayed on the short side, the deep black color of it made it look thicker than it was. Like wise, her arms and legs seemed to darken as her hair grow thicker on her limbs. A line of hair grew up her stomach from her regrown pubes, straight up to the cleavage between her pectorals where it fanned out across her chest in a neatly trimmed crop. She rubbed her chest absent-mindedly, enjoying the feel of her hand shifting the hair about, it was another reason not to shave, she loved when her partner played with it. Her pits exploded with thick dark hair, sure, it meant grooming a bit more regularly, especially after the gym, but some guys liked a little musk, too.<br />
<br />
She barely noticed the itch on her lip and chin as a short black beard began to grow in, and hair creeped down along her sideburns, meeting on her cheeks in a trimmed and well-maintained beard. It only itched for a second though, she had grown that beard as soon as she was old enough to do so, and hadn&#39;t shaved it off once since.<br />
<br />
=Question 15: If you were a guy... would you use cologne or hair gel?=<br />
<br />
=Yes, but not too much.= Her wavy hair became a bit more fixed in place, and a faint woodsy scent mixed with her own manly scent.<br />
<br />
=Question 16: If you were a guy... what type of shirt would you wear now?=<br />
<br />
=Lounging around the house like I am now? A tank top would be more than enough, even I even wore one. Who needs a shirt with a great bod?= Kenz smirked. Maybe that was a bit more sassy than her dream guy would normally be. But sometimes he&#39;d like showing off a little, even if it was just for himself.<br />
<br />
The scraps of Kenz&#39;s shirt faded away, leaving her bare chested and showing off her furry, well-muscled torso. Though a pink tank top appeared thrown over the back of a nearby chair for easy grabbing in case he needed to run out quickly for something.<br />
<br />
=Question 17: If you were a guy... would you be wearing briefs, boxers, or something in-between?=<br />
<br />
Well, that was definitely a question that needed an answer, wasn&#39;t it. =None of the above.= She typed. =A jock strap to keep things in place while out and about. But when at home, why not go commando? Maybe even when out, just for fun.= This was for an erotica after all.<br />
<br />
The last scraps of clothing Kenz had been wearing vanished, leaving her completely in the nude on her living room couch. But soon a pair of loose athletic shorts formed on her upper legs, though obviously tented from her still eager and ready erection, the soft mesh fabric felt good against her cock, and she found herself rubbing herself once again.<br />
<br />
A drawer in her bedroom filled with assorted colors of jock straps, all with larger pouches.<br />
<br />
=Question 18: If you were a guy... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.=<br />
<br />
Well, she didn&#39;t want her dream guy to be an idiot. He should be able to mingle, and brains always helped in making a living, but too smart could be insufferable. =8, high enough to make a really good living in the tech world, but not so smart as to be annoying.= <br />
<br />
Her apartment whirled around her, doubling in size. The small windows became larger sliding glass doors leading out onto a balcony with a view of downtown from a higher floor. Her phone upgraded to the latest model in her hand as everything in her apartment suddenly popped up in quality. A door opened leading to her new home office with a high end computer linked to several monitors, good for both work and gaming.<br />
<br />
=Question 19: If you were a guy... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes, and what would you weigh without clothes? (Don&#39;t lie)=<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t lie?&quot; Kenz said in her deep voice. &quot;If I&#39;m making it up, it can&#39;t be a lie.&quot; She shook her head but started answering. One thing was she liked the lead men in her erotica to be a little older, and the other one younger. But still young enough to have plenty of years in the tank. =38.= Some of the black hair on her head turned a deep steely grey, as well as some of her beard, the first signs of approaching middle age. Some finer lines appeared around her eyes, though a good skin care routine did wonders. He had to work out a bit more to keep his physique where it was, but another of the empty bedrooms converted into a home gym helped with that.<br />
<br />
=6&#39;2&quot;= That seemed a good height without being too tall. Enough to stand out, but not feel like a giant. Kenz&#39;s whole body began to stretch, her limbs lengthening as her shoulders and torso widened to keep her in proportion. She had to shift the wait she was sitting as she gained those several extra inches. =190 pounds.= Then she deleted it and put in =200, mostly muscle.= It&#39;d be good to be clear. Her muscles grew more, moving from leanly muscular and heading in the bulkier direction. Though she didn&#39;t sport a six pack, she did keep her stomach nice and flat, and her chest was definitely impressive.<br />
<br />
=Question 20: If you were a guy... what would your name be?=<br />
<br />
Kenz needed the right name for this DILF of a man. Rubbing her bearded chin it came to her. =Casey.= <br />
<br />
Reaching the end of the survey, Casey hit submit. Well, maybe the author would write the story, they didn&#39;t need to know that character he submitted for them to write about was himself. He set his phone down on the table, though instead of picking his dinner back up, he placed his hand on his cock, giving it a light stroke through the thin fabric of his shorts. Damn, that had gotten him worked up. He could go jerk off, but then again it was Friday night. It was still early enough to change plans, instead of staying in he could go down to he bar and see if he could pick up some company for the evening.<br />
<br />
Or.. Casey picked his phone back up and opened another app. He started scrolling, looking for some young muscle stud to invite over and he could take care of this problem in a much more satisfying manner. Maybe one day in the next few years he&#39;d find some guy to settle down with, but for now he enjoyed the freedom of choice. It didn&#39;t take long to get a hit, not with a profile pic like his.</p>
