<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Marcy had actually <i>gotten</i> to the mall, she realized how little she wanted to actually wanted to work. Having a supernatural transforming ray gun tends to change your perspective on things. Instead, she opted to watch out for more possible maids that she could employ.<br />
<br />
Her eyes darted among the workers at all the surrounding shops. She saw a barista at the coffee place that would make a cute dog girl, a cashier at the candle shop that was already so much hotter than Marcy, and the guy at the hardware store - he could fix up around the house, and the gun would fix uglier aspects. She was ready to take a shot when she was accosted my two teen girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice toy, dumbass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try not to hurt anyone with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy recognized the one on the left as the younger sister of Allison, a girl that always used to harass her at school. When the girl on the left tried to grab for the ray gun, Marcy pulled the trigger, hitting both of them in the process.<br />
<br />
The gun was set to make a cute dog maid, and so it did. In an instant, both girls grew short snouts and whiskers. Their ears moved to the top of their head, and their hair was tied up in a large bow. They had on above-knee dresses that had frills at the collar, hem, and at the end of their long sleeves. The girls were almost identical except for their color schemes - one had blonde fur, brown hair, a black dress, and white frills; the other had brown fur, blonde hair, a white dress, and black frills.<br />
<br />
Their looks of anger turned into puppy-dog eyes. &quot;Mistress we&#39;re so glad you took us shopping with you!&quot; said the one on the left. &quot;Yeah, school is such a bore sometimes&quot; said the other one. Marcy had no idea what either of them was named, so she just settled for referring to them collectively as &quot;girls&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just then, she heard a ding. Both of the dog-girls checked to see if it was their phones, but you knew where it came from. On the screen flashed a message:<br />
<br />
<i>Congratulations! You have created five (5) new anthro maids and unlocked version 1.2.2. In this new update you can now change the settings of previously existing maids. Change them from adorable to busty, maid dress to nude, and even change their species! You can also alter the reality setting to add or remove awareness. Changing from &quot;reality distortion field&quot; to &quot;change awareness&quot; will cause the target to realize their changes at that moment. Your next upgrade is at ten (10) created anthro maids.</i><br />
<br />
It seemed weird to hide software updates like that. What if there was a major bug that she couldn&#39;t fix, only because she hadn&#39;t gotten to 200 transformations?<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t noticed any settings about &quot;awareness&quot; until now. She could find people that actually wanted to be changed and would thank her for it, instead of people that just <i>were</i> changed and <i>lived with it</i>. Someone instantly came to mind, and she was already in this mall.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Zoe was just starting her shift at Gameshop™ when she saw Marcy come in, flanked by two young dog-girls. She&#39;d seen Marcy&#39;s maids when she visited her home, but she never went out with them in public.<br />
<br />
Come to think about it, the only anthros she&#39;d seen were employed by Marcy. She was sure there were more, but where?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Marcy? What&#39;re you looking for? And, uh, who&#39;re the pups?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re - &quot; Marcy was about to forget their names, when the dogs interrupted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Emma and Lilly&quot; they said in unison. Now the only mystery was which is which...<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wanting to talk to you.&quot; Zoe saw her hide something in her pocket. &quot;Have you ever wanted to be an anthro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure everyone does to some extent. But we&#39;re both furries, right? You&#39;ve seen my little rat girl fursona - &quot; at that moment, Zoe felt a bolt of energy enter her body. She was <i>shrinking</i>. She felt her nose form a long snout, she felt her ears round out, she saw her hands become nothing but paws with opposable thumbs. Her uniform changed into that of an anime maid, but with a Gameshop employee tag on the top of her apron.<br />
<br />
The oddest change was the thing that hadn&#39;t changed - her sex. Zoe was a trans woman that had given up on surgery or proper HRT, and her new rat body was the same - there was a penis under her dress, and her breasts were actually larger than before. She opened her phone to use as a mirror, and every aspect - down to the fur patterns and the violet hair - was identical to her fursona. That would&#39;ve meant she was only 3&#39;10&quot; - cute to draw and roleplay, but in reality it made her the size of a young child.<br />
<br />
She ran up to Marcy and gave her a hug, with her head only coming up to her chest. She even squeaked out a few &quot;thank you&quot;s for good measure.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Marcy handed 30 bucks to the Emma and Lilly and told them to run around the mall, giving her and Zoe some much needed privacy. As Marcy explained to Zoe, she found a gun that turned girls into anthro maid girls, and she&#39;d already turned 5 others. When Zoe heard that number, she was shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t just turn random people into your maids! Especially if you&#39;re changed their biology!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I for one think we need furries to be real, even if it means me hiring some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthros already were real! Didn&#39;t you learn about them at school!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No dude, they weren&#39;t before I got the gun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe was even more shocked. Did her friend create a new subspecies out of thin air? <i>How</i> and more importantly <i>why</i> was she the one given that power?<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what? I&#39;m tired of thinking about the ethical implications of this. Do you wanna like, see a movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;ll call off. What do you want to see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about that big action movie? I heard it&#39;s pretty mediocre.&quot;<br />
<br />
They called the dogs over, and went to the mall&#39;s theater. Zoe had to stop her from using the gun on the teller, which allowed Marcey to have the oddest interaction of the day. She handed him her credit card, and he stopped to look at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong? Is it expired?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s just... Marcy Simmons? Are you <i>the</i> Marcy Simmons? I love your stuff! Especially that album you produced for &#7842;&#626;&#331;&#7842;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy was confused on several levels. For one, she <i>wasn&#39;t</i> famous, she&#39;d probably made a total of 200 dollars off of music over the years. Additionally, she didn&#39;t know anyone named &quot;&#7842;&#626;&#331;&#7842;&quot;, and had no idea how someone would pronounce that.<br />
<br />
After they&#39;d got into the theatre, she looked herself up, and there it was: <i><b>Marcia &quot;Marcy&quot; Simmons</b> is a Grammy award winning music producer and visual artist...</i> I guess that&#39;s how she afforded to employ six maids. But, why would a Grammy winner be living in the middle of nowhere suburbia?<br />
<br />
For the record, the movie was alright. It ran just under 2 hours, had decent writing, and the climactic battle was well directed. Marcy was most interested in one of the minor antagonists- a blue cat lady wearing the smallest amount of clothing possible. It seems that that her ray gun had influence as far as Hollywood. For a normal person, this would have scared them, and they&#39;d either throw the ray gun into the ocean, bury it in a deep hole, or just smash it to pieces.<br />
<br />
Marcy wasn&#39;t a normal person.</p>
