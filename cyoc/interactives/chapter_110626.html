<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tachibana no Akane looked at the master clock in the main council chamber and sighed.<br />
There was much to do between dealing with Julie Stovall and now the death of Alyssa Cooper at the paws of the Luna Brotherhood, but considering the hour, she agreed with fellow Council member Andrew Curtis that a fresh start would be best for everyone come morning, provided that proper security precautions and arrangements were made beforehand.<br />
&quot;We shall inform the schools that with the Were Alert canceled, they can hold classes tomorrow as normally scheduled, but we will still need Eric Anderson and Frieda Knight here for the formal presentation of Julie Stovall&#39;s verdict and sentencing,&quot; pointed out Akane. &quot;Which also means Spencer Lawson will at least need to be in the building.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand, so we will try Stovall separately on Debbie&#39;s murder during her escape from custody?&quot; inquired Curtis, not wanting to broach the subject of asking exactly what it was between the three teenagers that made them so important that they had to stay together.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; confirmed Tachibana.<br />
&quot;I shall inform her parents too,&quot; replied Curtis.<br />
&quot;If they are able to come. Martin Stovall should be sober by now but the last I heard, Melissa was hospitalized for some kind of stress related fainting spell.&quot;<br />
&quot;I hope she and her unborn child are all right.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too. We might also need Julie Stovall&#39;s testimony in regards to any prosecution concerning the Luna Brotherhood,&quot; added Akane. &quot;Can you handle acquiring her cooperation on that Andrew?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; promised the were-mer representative, unable to stifle a yawn. &quot;But tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; said Tachibana, as both weres prepared to leave the building, not noticing Sheriff Douglas Cooper, still in his were-grizzly fursona, heading to where the prisoners were being held.<br />
<br />
BACKTRACKING...<br />
While both the legitimate and the illegal hunt conducted by the Luna Brotherhood for Julie Stovall was happening, Brian Walker was alone in the privacy of his bedroom, enjoying were porn over the Internet.<br />
Most of it was produced by normal human beings thinking they were indulging in creating fantasy situations that could never happen in &quot;real life&quot;, but some was actually produced by weres for weres, if one knew where and what you were looking for.<br />
Brian was computer smart and careful enough to cover his tracks during and after every porn session he had, but only went to the free sites so there would be no financial trail or costs that his mother could discover or complain about.<br />
He was sitting in his desk chair, the dark fur of his were-otter form back-lit by the glow from the computer monitor as he took matters into his own paws, when an odd buzzing sound caught his attention.<br />
It took him a couple of moments to track down the source and discover it was the secret cellphone he acquired to cover calls concerning his &quot;business&quot;, especially since his mother had confiscated his public cell as part of his punishment because of his dealings with Julie Stovall and Alyssa Cooper.<br />
<i>Either I&#39;ll have to leave this off when not in use or make sure I put it in something sound proof,</i> he realized, while answering the call. &quot;Hello?&quot; he said. The fact that he recognized the number was the only reason he answered it at all.<br />
&quot;Hello Otter Boy. How&#39;s it hanging?&quot; purred Betty the werecat on the other end.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s hanging pretty good right now,&quot; he replied, looking down at his erection. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m horny and hungry for a good hard cock in ALL my holes!&quot; complained Betty, while sitting in her bed, using one paw to tease her clit while the other held her cellphone.<br />
&quot;Well, I have the pussy pleaser to please your pussy, and every other part you want pleasured,&quot; he said with a smile, thinking about the next bout of sex he would have with the older were female.<br />
&quot;Good. Has the Were Alert been lifted yet?&quot; wondered Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know about that?&quot; asked Brian, amazed.<br />
&quot;Despite living in Seattle now, I&#39;m Moon Lake born and bred,&quot; bragged Betty.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still on,&quot; said Brian, looking at the time and realizing that either his mom was still at her day job at Moon Lake General Hospital because of the Were Alert or else had gone on to waitress at The Local Diner for the evening, because she had never come home.<br />
&quot;Well, I hope we can still get together for at least part of this weekend. When it&#39;s lifted, text me with the news and your availability and we&#39;ll go from there. You will not believe how horny I am.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; said Brian, thinking of his &quot;audition&quot; session between her and Alyssa Cooper.<br />
&quot;Good. Anyway, the other reason I&#39;m calling is that I talked to Alyssa yesterday,&quot; said Betty, starting to tell him the lie she had spent the afternoon rehearsing, not knowing her friend&#39;s fate and not about to tell Brian her part in getting the were-mermaid arrested. &quot;She&#39;s planning to go back and stay in California for a while so she doesn&#39;t have to deal with her cousin the Sheriff again, so Alyssa said I could handle your training and establishment as long as she gets to enjoy you the next time she&#39;s back in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
&quot;<i>Training and establishment</i>?&quot; repeated Brian, wondering what Betty meant, but looking forward to more fun with Alyssa, not knowing her fate.<br />
&quot;As a gigolo silly.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. But I think I&#39;m already pretty good at sex,&quot; he bragged.<br />
&quot;That you are you furry hunk. That you are. But there&#39;s other things to learn about. Like which were ladies to approach and how to develop repeat clientele, how to avoid being caught by the law since collecting money for sex is illegal everywhere in the United States except for most of Nevada. Things like that.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ll be my <i>trainer</i>?&quot;<br />
&quot;For now. Once you&#39;ve learned your lessons, I&#39;ll continue on as your agent if you don&#39;t mind. I know lots of horny were females that would love to be fucked by a stud with lots of stamina that&#39;s also a were with no strings attached so they don&#39;t have to worry about accidentally transforming a normal.&quot; <i>Or their husbands and &quot;significant others&quot; finding out,</i> she silently added.<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; agreed Brian, as he called up images of were-felines in heat on his computer. &quot;Tell me, what are you doing right now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Guess,&quot; teased Betty.<br />
&quot;Since you&#39;re talking to me, I bet you&#39;re all alone wherever you are, wishing I was there taking care of you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good guess,&quot; replied Betty, as she felt the shudder of a small orgasm.<br />
&quot;If I was with you right now, I&#39;d be nuzzling your neck and breasts while one paw pleasured that wet and delicious pussy of yours.&quot;<br />
&quot;If you think it&#39;s wet and delicious now, just wait until your head&#39;s between my legs and that talented tongue of yours is caressing my clit,&quot; purred Betty, getting into the act and not believing she was being turned on by a 14 year old having phone sex with her.<br />
&quot;My tongue on your hot pussy is just as good as your oral skills on my hard otter penis,&quot; said Brian, stroking himself a little faster after making sure tissues were within reach.<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;d love to 69 you right now handsome,&quot; purred Betty. <i>Too bad you&#39;re too young to take to The Were Club. Then again, I&#39;d probably have to fight every horny female there for your company,</i> she realized.<br />
&quot;And then after we&#39;ve both climaxed orally, I wouldn&#39;t give you much time to recover before I started plunging my hard cock into your hungry cunt.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh... yes...&quot; moaned Betty, while her thumb teased her clit while the rest of her paw was going in and out of her moist pussy.<br />
&quot;Or would you like me to really give you a hard ride and drive this steel rod of mine deep into that hot ass of yours?&quot; asked Brian.<br />
Betty&#39;s answer was a scream of ecstasy as she came.<br />
<br />
Brian deposited the used wad of tissues into a plastic shopping bag that he would dump directly into the trashcan outside later, then waited for Betty to catch her breath enough so she could speak again.<br />
&quot;When?&quot; she wanted to know.<br />
&quot;When what?&quot; he asked in return.<br />
&quot;When can we actually get together and fuck each other silly?&quot;<br />
Brian had to stop and think about that for a moment. <i>Between mom and her work schedules, my probable cleaning gig at the Elder&#39;s Council...</i> &quot;Depending upon when the Were Alert&#39;s lifted, probably Saturday. I can more than likely give you all that afternoon and maybe even part of the evening, but I won&#39;t be able to stay overnight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; complained Betty, as she teased her clit long enough to experience a pleasurable orgasmic after shock. <i>Guess I&#39;ll be partying at The Were Club Saturday night after all.</i> &quot;Considering your age and the fact we both have secrets to protect, guess I&#39;ll have to settle for whatever I can get,&quot; she told him. <i>But as soon as you turn 18 and graduate high school, I&#39;m setting you up in the business permanently!</i><br />
&quot;Soon as the Were Alert&#39;s lifted and I can give you a definitive answer, I&#39;ll text you the info,&quot; promised Brian.<br />
&quot;And when I receive that, I&#39;ll head to Moon Lake and text you my room number as soon as I check into the hotel,&quot; said Betty, not knowing that the only reason she would be in Moon Lake any time soon would actually be to provide background information while testifying in the Elders&#39; trial against the Luna Brotherhood, preventing her from seeing Brian at all that weekend. &quot;But when I get there, you better come as soon as you can Otter Boy, because I want to come, and come, and come...&quot;<br />
&quot;You will, my horny feline,&quot; said Brian, the thought of taking care of the hot werecat sexually was already causing his cock to form another erection. &quot;Care to have another round verbally?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; purred Betty, even as she started thinking about what to say and wishing Brian was physically with her instead.<br />
___________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
The &quot;Sex beyond any of the above&quot; option was chosen because that was the closest thing I could find to cover &quot;mutual self pleasure via phone sex&quot;.<br />
And it&#39;s already been established that between the life longevity of weres and the May/December relationships some have, sex between an adult were and a minor (at least 14 years old and having already experienced their first transformation) is legal, but ONLY in Moon Lake if all parties are willing. All other state and Federal &quot;Special Victims&quot; regulations apply.—tmw.</p>
