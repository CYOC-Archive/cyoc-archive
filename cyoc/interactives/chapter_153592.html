<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harvey still had time before his next class, so he headed straight for his dorm. Harry&#39;s bed was topped with cardboard boxes, and Harry himself was rummaging through his wardrobe. He would evaluate individual items before deeming they were no good and tossing them behind him. &quot;Dude, I&#39;ve been gone for a few hours, are you still trying to find something to wear?&quot; Harvey asked his room mate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Honey, I already picked out a casual outfit for the day&quot; Harry replied without taking his eyes off his clothes. &quot;That&#39;s what I wore to pick up all those boxes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, what is all this stuff?&quot; Harvey sat on Harry&#39;s bed and peeked inside the boxes. It was a mix of decorations, papers, and small items that looked like they could be used for games.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are the supplies for tomorrow&#39;s Queer Student Union meeting. As secretary it was my job to pick them up from storage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why are you changing again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And repeat an outfit on the same day? Hell no. There&#39;s an executive meeting with all the Queer Student Union&#39;s leaders tonight, so I need to look my best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheesh, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not a member of your gay club&quot; Harvey sighed, &quot;If I spent as much time on clothes as you did, I&#39;d never get out of this dorm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut up&quot; Harry said, tossing a shirt he was looking at onto his bed, &quot;I bet I spend less time on clothes than you do styling that ridiculous pompadour&quot; Harry ran his fingers through his own curly hair, then turned around to face his room mate, finally seeing that Harvey was wearing a patka, &quot;Or at least, how much time you usually spend on it. That thing on your head is new. Is it some kind of fashion statement?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Harvey placed his hands on top of his head, feeling cloth where he expected to feel gelled hair. &quot;I thought I took this thing of last night. Did I tie it back on this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you mumbling about?&quot; Harry turned back to his wardrobe, &quot;instead of making fashion statements like that, I wish you were a fashion guru. I could use some advice.&quot; Harry grabbed a pink scarf and wrapped it around his neck. He considered it for a moment before tossing it towards the bed like all the rest. This time, it landed on Harvey&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
The scarf wrapped itself around Harvey&#39;s patka, forming a pink UK-style turban. &quot;Wait... this is just like with Gurpreet&#39;s table cloth. Was- was that real? It is happening again!?&quot; While Harvey was expressing a great deal of panic, the texture of his face became smoother, and his cheek bones were more pronounced. All of his hair once again darkened to a shade of black. His mustache thickened, covering his upper lip, and his beard grew to his collar in a squared off shape. To maintain this shape it was not cut, but rather well maintained. Harvey winced, expecting to bloat into a fat man like before. Instead, he grew a bit taller and slimmed into a model physique. He got that warm feeling again as his skin turned an Indian hue, a bit darker than Harvey&#39;s normal time, but a good amount lighter than previously. His features changed slightly to be more telling of a Punjabi man, but it was unmistakably Harvey&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
Finally the rest of his clothes were altered. He was wearing a light blue silk button up with grey wool trousers and brown leather shoes. A tricolor, diagonally striped long tie appeared around his collar. A pink scarf, matching his new turban, hung from his neck, and a dark navy suit jacket topped his shoulders. Harvey looked at his arms in disbelief, his wrists were decorated with a gold watch on the left and an iron Kara bracelet on the right. &quot;Am I imagining things again? Why is it so different this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Harpinder&quot; Harry started, as if Harvey hadn&#39;t said anything just now. He was holding up two shirts, one in each hand, &quot;Which do you think would look better on me tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about, Harry?&quot; Harvey realized this was just like with Gurpreet. Harvey, or Harpinder as he was now, seemed completely normal to Harry. &quot;You never ask me for advice about clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just didn&#39;t want to bug you with my day to day stuff&quot; Harry admitted, a bit embarrassed &quot;you&#39;re such a famous fashion influencer after all. I&#39;m sure you have more important things to do.&quot; Just then Harvey got a notification on his phone, actually he was receiving several. He unlocked it and the phone opened to a photo-sharing social media app. Instead of his usual profile, he was logged into @sikhstyleguru under the name Harpinder Singh. The page looked like it was regularly updated with photos of Harvey as he appeared now, wearing a variety of fashionable suits and street wear. Scrolling down, Harvey figured this page had to have been active for a few years, which should have been impossible because he only transformed a few weeks ago. Was reality changing? Is that why no one thought his sudden changes were odd? Either way, Harvey took this as proof that he wasn&#39;t imagining things, he really had become a Sikh man. <br />
<br />
He tapped on his most recent photo, the one he was getting notifications for. The like count was already well above three thousand and still ticking up. Comments included phrases like &quot;waheguru&quot; followed by praying hands emoji and &quot;Att&quot; with the fire emoji. &quot;I really am a fashion influencer&quot; Harvey said to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you, you know better than anyone&quot; Harry said. Harvey was confident he&#39;d be able to return to normal, as he had before. For now he decided he would play along with Harry&#39;s vision of him, as it would be useless to try and convince Harry that he was someone else. Still, Harvey&#39;s idea of a good outfit was a white tee and black jeans, hardly the wisdom that Harry was expecting. He decided he should just answer truthfully. &quot;Honestly, Harry, I don&#39;t think either of those shirts would work.&quot; Harpinder stroked his hairy chin while thinking, &quot;If you&#39;re going to meet with other leaders of your organization, you yourself should look like a leader. I think I can lend you something.&quot; He turned to his own wardrobe and saw that it was replaced by a pop-up closet. Due to the dorm&#39;s restricted space, it was smaller than any proper closet would be, but it still had enough rack space to hold Harprinder&#39;s many suits, with drawers at the bottom for the rest of his clothes. He picked out a deep blue dress shirt, a vibrant yellow dress tie, brown slacks, and matching black leather belt and dress shoes. Harry quickly changed and the items fit surprisingly well on him, despite belonging to someone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome, I&#39;ve never had a suit I liked this much&quot; Harry was checking himself out from a few different angles.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all about finding the right fit. Now you look ready for business&quot; Harprinder grinned. Harry threw his arms up and gave Harpinder a big hug. He chuckled and hugged back, &quot;Easy there, try not to wrinkle my shirt too much.&quot; Harpinder impressed even himself with his wisdom. Maybe this fashion influencer thing wouldn&#39;t be too hard. Once Harry had let go, apologizing for any wrinkles he might have caused, Harpinder turned back to his closet and considered his next move.</p>
