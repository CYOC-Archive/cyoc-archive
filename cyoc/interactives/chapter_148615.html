<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So how has the voyage been going for you so far young prince?”<br />
<br />
Tenoch sighed. “I want to talk about this new world and the captain’s adventures but all he does is complain about his son.  He says Kidd takes everything for granted and how he’s squandering his youth blah blah blah.  How about you John?”<br />
<br />
“Same here. Kidd just complains about his dad and about how he’d make a much better captain.  Guess there’s nothing we can do about it though.”<br />
<br />
Just then Tenoch got a wicked idea.  “We’ll be stopping for some more shipments on a small island soon, is that correct John? <br />
<br />
“Yes...what do you have in mind.?”<br />
<br />
“While the crew is off the ship I can conduct another body swap ritual but this time with the captain and his son!”<br />
<br />
“But why?  How will that help?”<br />
<br />
“The captain actually argued with me earlier about wanting to keep you on a permanent basis since you didn’t bring him any treasure like you promised.  If I offer to conduct this ritual he can just take that as a payment.  His son seems to like having you as a servant as well.  Those two will gladly rather try to compete with each other than keep you as a servant. We’ll ask them when the crew gets off the ship.”<br />
John agreed with Tenoch’s plan.  He had to, or else he’d be stuck as an exotic servant to these pirates.<br />
—————————<br />
<br />
When the ship reached land the crew eagerly got off and went to the nearest pub on the small island.  Kidd and Captain Klark were the last to attempt to leave when Tenoch stopped them.<br />
<br />
“Wait men! I think my little native boy has something that might interest you in exchange for letting him stay with me.”  Tenoch winked at John as he nudged him forward.<br />
<br />
“Um I can perform an ancient ritual that can swap your bodies.  Kidd can be the captain and Klark can regain his youth.  What do yo say?”  John kneeled.<br />
<br />
Captain Klark simply spit and looked at Tenoch. “John, you really believe what this little native boy says?” Tenoch smiled “More than you know.”<br />
<br />
The Captain stroked his beard “Hmm, well how bout it ya ungrateful little urchin, think you can handle being ya old capt’n?<br />
<br />
Kidd laughed at how stupid this all sounded, he just hoped on involved some native drugs for him to trip out on.  He spit into a bucket “I’m sure as hell I can handle it old man”<br />
<br />
“Great! I’ll have my servant prepare the ritual. You can do it on the deck since the crew is gone.” Tenoch said.<br />
<br />
John stood up.  “You two will... need to strip for the ritual.”  <br />
<br />
“Fine then, we’re comfortable with our bodies, at least I am” Kidd flexed. “Right Capt’n?”<br />
<br />
Captain Klark began taking off his coat, “Right ya filthy barnacle scraper.”<br />
<br />
“WAIT, you don’t need to be naked right here now! Here, have these blankets to keep some modesty after you strip in private.”<br />
<br />
The two pirates looked at John.  “Strange words coming from a tribal boy...”<br />
<br />
“Um I guess my master’s teachings are rubbing off on me haha.  I mean you should keep the transformation somewhat surprising!  Just wait for the ritual for the full body reveal.”  The two agreed and went to their respective quarters to strip.<br />
<br />
“Phew that was close.” <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tenoch began to scribble done the ancient symbols on a small wooden plank while the two stripped.  John was able to take a peak at them while Tenoch wasn’t looking.<br />
<br />
After Tenoch was done he wrapped the plank in cloth so no one could see the symbols.  John whispered “What about these piercings we have on our nipples, don’t they have something to do with this?” Tenoch whisper back.  These just help with transferring the bodies back as well as some other things.  They aren’t required for the ceremony to function.<br />
<br />
John felt strangely relieved but confused as to what Tenoch meant by “other things.”<br />
<br />
The father and son returned to the deck with nothing but the cloth John gave them tied around their waists.<br />
Kidd chuckled at the sight of his fathers bald head.  “I see why you keep the hat on haha!”<br />
<br />
The two walked up to John.  “There’s usually have slabs of stone for this but these wooden benches from the mess hall will do.  You can lay down.  The pirates obeyed.  <br />
<br />
Tenoch brought it an empty steel barrel and started a fire inside of it.  <br />
<br />
He then walked up to John and whispered the instructions of the ritual in his ear.  It didn’t matter who said the words, only that they’re spoken aloud while the symbols are being burned.  John had to say it while he was in Tenoch’s body only to keep feelings of suspicion away from the two pirates.<br />
<br />
John tossed the piece of wood in the barrel fire at the center of the deck.<br />
“Um with this ancient script, we move the souls of these two creatures!”  John looked to Tenoch who nodded his head and mouthed “continue”<br />
<br />
“Ugh now we return them to their natural state at birth, without a stitch on their humble forms.” <br />
<br />
John pulled away both the cloth sheets.  Smoke then began to circle around both men.  “Wow” John said aloud.  He had passed out during his first transformation, now he had a front row seat to what happened to him in the ritual. <br />
<br />
“ARGH WAIT I can’t move?! I change my mind! Let me out of this!”  Kidd demanded.<br />
<br />
“Stop whining ya sardine! Look, it’s working!” Klark yelled.<br />
<br />
Kidd looked down and sure enough his body was starting to expand.  His chest and face became insanely itching as hair follicles began appearing.  His body was becoming a dense ginger forest.  His hairline however receded as chunks of it fell out, soon enough he was bald.  His respectable 7 inch penis shrank to 4 but grew in girth.  His balls grew much larger as well and hung a bit lower.  His pubic hair spread to a thick treasure trail that met the rest of his hairy torso and even down to his thighs.  His penis was soon lost in the hair and hidden from his sight due to his expanding gut.  His arms packed on a lot of muscle and tattoos appeared on them.  His feet ballooned to fit his new big body.  His beard was large and bushy. Small braids were mixed it but it overall still had a lot of volume.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Klark was thinning and hair receded.  His dick gained some inches and his son’s hair grew on his head.  His gut disappeared and in it’s place were finely sculpted abs.  He strained as his balls went up slightly.  His precious beard vanished and his ears stuck out slightly more than before.  He even gained an old canine tooth the lost in a bar fight! <br />
<br />
The smoke lowered them onto the opposite tables.  The scene looked just like before the ceremony started.<br />
<br />
The two were now knocked out cold like John was during his ceremony.<br />
<br />
So what do we do if they don’t like it.  They might not like it but they’re both so stubborn that neither of them will want switch back to admit defeat.  You will see.  Watch, they are beginning to awaken.</p>
