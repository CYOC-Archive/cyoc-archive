<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stood beside the coach was the most beautiful boy I had ever seen. The mere sight of him caused a twinge deep within me. I'd never been a believer in soppy stories about &quot;love at first sight&quot;, but this new body in which I found myself was infatuated with the physique I saw before me. Now I knew what it was like for those girls who who'd burst into tears when spurned by their latest crush. He was gorgeous.<br />
<br />
I couldn't put my finger on what it was about him which so excited me though. Everything about his body just seem to draw me to him. I don't know whether it was his tousled sandy hair, the way it hung down over his sinewy but smooth neck or his chiseled jaw surrounding delicate but juicy-looking lips. It could have been his deep, dreamy, sparkly brown eyes or even just the deep golden tan of his skin, shaved smooth all over like all good swimmers. It could have been his bunched muscles in his biceps or his strong, broad, swimmers' shoulders. I didn't know whether it was his smooth chest, or the clear definition of his firm pectoral muscles. It could have been the elegant smooth lines of the sides and backs of his powerful legs, the tight buns of his arse in his knee-length and oh-so-tight trunks the same colour as my own skimpy costume. I know I did like his long, slim athletic legs and he had a giant package hidden in those trunks. Or it could have just been the totality of this 6 foot beauty and the strength he exuded towards me, trapped in this dainty body. <br />
<br />
Gazing at him I must have drifted away from what the coach was saying for I came out of my lovelorn trance to hear giggles from the other girls around me. The strong stud I was gazing at suddenly connected with my eyes before looking down with a wry grin on his gorgeous face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young lady - if you want to drool over Sean could you please do it in your own time not my training sessions?&quot; The coach barked at me.<br />
<br />
I was devastated and could feel blood rushing to my cheeks. Amid the laughs I realised that the whole squad had seen me gauping at the boy, who I guessed must be called Sean. It was my turn to look to the ground, but even as I did so I felt the longing to gaze at him again welling up inside me. Even despite this public embarassment I found myself wondering how it would feel to be enveloped in his strong arms and held close to that beautiful skin, drawn tight over his firm muscles. <br />
<br />
Again the voice of the coach broke my reveries as she ordered us to start our warm-up prior to the practice. How I got through the next hour was beyond me. Even in the warm-up I found myself unable to resist throwing lingering glances over at Sean's form as he stretched out those long, toned muscles. As he did his leg-stretches I marvelled at the tightness of his lycra trunks as they encased the power of his thighs. In the pool itself I could barely concentrate on my strokes as I found myself distracted by the legs of the boys in the next lane down, trying to spot the tight curves of Sean's calves. Twice I nearly swam into the girls coming down the lane. I had to get out of this body fast before I did do something I regretted.<br />
<br />
Having swum a bit in my own body back when I was still a Roger I have to say I found it very different swimming as a Tara. These curves, my wider hips and my breasts gave me a much different feeling and balance in the water. I felt much less streamlined and the water kept tugging back at my breasts as I pulled myself forward. My lungs also felt as though they would burst after three strokes of crawl whereas as a boy I'd been able to pull off more like five before breathing. All in all I felt like I was floating better with the ballasts of my butt but wallowing more as I dragged myself through the lengths. I certainly felt weaker and, dare I say it, more vulnerable, especially with these thoughts about Sean racing through my head. Heck, I hadn't even ever spoken to the boy.<br />
<br />
As I hauled myself out of the pool at the end of the practice and rolled onto the edge of the pool to sit, I again marvelled at how much more I had beneath me when I sat down in this body. It really felt so different from being a guy - all my movements felt even to me more graceful and rolling than determined. I was disappointed to see that the boys had already finished and were out in their locker rooms...<br />
<br />
Picking myself up to my feet I began to trot back to the locker room myself. Glancing down at my body, my own shapely legs and hips and my taught flat stomach shown off in this damn skimpy two-piece, I thought to myself &quot;well, they're sure missing something here&quot;.<br />
<br />
With the other girls behind me, many who seemed older gossiping amongst themselves, I turned the corner away from the pool and pushed open the locker room door. <br />
<br />
Then I screamed. <br />
<br />
In front of me were about twenty semi-dressed or naked guys all staring at me, in this tiny little costume showing the wares that this new body had to offer. I'd only gone into the boys' locker room hadn't I! A great cheer rose up from all the guys in there as they saw my shocked figure. They must have thought that Christmas had come early. What had I done!? It took me a couple of seconds to even gather my bearings and realise my mistake during which time they all got more than an eyeful of this cute figure in which I truly felt trapped. Worse than that, I have to say I was deeply excited by the sight which greeted me. One guy was showing off his tight arse as he bent down to pick up his white cotton boxers, and there was Sean, just towelling himself down, sweaty from the work-out and the hot shower.<br />
<br />
Ripping my eyes away from the view which left me with a strange smouldering feeling between my legs I ran out. Behind me a chorus of jeers and shouts rang out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't go, gorgeous!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wanna see something really special?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why are you leaving?&quot;<br />
&quot;She's gagging for it. I'll see to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, my cheeks felt as if they would burn with embarassment as I ran to the girls' lockers, cupping those damn swinging breasts as I went. I don't know what came over me but I felt completely betrayed and humiliated - God knows by who. As I sat on the bench I bent over and could feel tears welling up in my eyes, but before I began to sob I felt an arm reach around my back and rub my naked shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, Tara, we all do dumb stuff now and again. It'll all be forgotten when everyone settles in for sure.&quot; I recognised the voice and looking up recognised Sandra from cheerleading practice.<br />
<br />
Still upset, I could only gaze at the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, cheer up. Nobody will think of it again unless you make it a big deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Sandra. That's real sweet of you.&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now come on, let's get showered and changed. You're quite lucky as well though; I'd have killed for a view of what you got. Some of those boys in the squad are real hotties!&quot; She joked. Despite myself I couldn't help chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a darling, Sandra,&quot; I found myself saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As we showered and dressed again, I began to chat to Sandra more and began to get to know each other. She gave me a puzzled look a couple of times as I dressed very slowly - I'd only been a woman for fourteen hours, and most of those I'd been naked or on my back remember! - but we got on like a house on fire. Despite the distraction as I showered my hands came to rest on my intimate areas and as I washed my breasts I felt my nipples harden under my touch. Under the streams of hot water my mind wandered yet again back to Sean, his beautiful face and those tight muscles. I really did long for him and it became so hard to think of anything else. By the time I got out of the shower to tackle the terrible school commissionned uniform I'd had to turn it to cold.<br />
<br />
Having finally struggled into the blue and green tartan dress, along with the tights and my dainty underwear I walked towards the door of the locker room (the right one this time) just behind Sandra. These dresses were very short, and I was slightly concerned that as I admired Sandra's body, her long shapely legs and her firm bum, that I did so dispassionately. I should have thought it drop-dead gorgeous to see her like that, even more so to have seen her pert breasts as she dried them, but there was nothing. I guess you lost some of your hormonal instincts in a body change like this, I reasoned. <br />
<br />
Outside I was in for a shock. There, right outside the door, was Sean himself. I let out a little gasp. Then he even spoke to me!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, w'assup?&quot; he said to me. His voice was like soft snow falling to my ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see you later, Tara,&quot; Sandra said, and winked at me as she walked off briskly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's Tara is it. Nice name.&quot; Sean said. &quot;Hope you don't mind me waiting for you, but...&quot;</p>
