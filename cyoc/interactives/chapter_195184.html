<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Laura arrived at the front door she noticed that she was the first to arrive because the door was locked, as she searched in her purse for it, she was interrupted by a voice behind her that she recognized as Kaitlin&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura, is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura turned around, a little stressed to see her co-worker&#39;s reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kaitlin...&quot; she said softly with a friendly smile at the corner of her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura oh my god is it really you? But but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I feel like this is going to be a long explanation.&quot; Laura said with a sigh<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A quarter of an hour later, Laura had finished telling her story, and succeeding in making her believe that it was indeed magic dice that had made her so young was a real test.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you know everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, first question: Why didn&#39;t you wait for me last night and leave so hurriedly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that...I was so obsessed with the idea of being young again that I had put work aside, and you along with it but hey I&#39;m here now.&quot; Laura said, trying not to draw suspicion from her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I can understand, I might have reacted the same way but it&#39;s still a little offensive.&quot; Kaitlin pouted, crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry&quot; said Laura.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a really strange start to the morning, my serious, hard-working older colleague begging me to forgive her when she looks like she&#39;s just starting her career&quot; Kaitlin said amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about a strange morning, I just went from 31 to 25 while on my way to work.&quot; Said Laura as she gestured toward her car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I admit that part of the story is pretty dumb though, I mean you could have secured the dice a little better right? Anyway, the effects don&#39;t look so bad, you look really great, and I can&#39;t imagine how fit you must be.&quot; Kaitlin finished admiring Laura&#39;s body from top to bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s clear, being back in my mid-twenties has made me so much more vibrant, and...I&#39;ve regained a joie de vivre that I&#39;d forgotten about over time.&quot; Finished Laura by combing her hair back.<br />
<br />
Kaitlin was still amazed at how young and gorgeous Laura looked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we should get to work don&#39;t you think?&quot; Laura said as she turned to the side of the door and unlocked the handle.<br />
<br />
As the two women walked into the office, Laura pressing the automatic button to open the shutters of the room, Kaitlin rushed in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I figured.&quot; With that Laura placed her purse on the table and carefully pulled out two magic dice that Kaitlin watched carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;So these are the famous dice, they don&#39;t look so special.&quot; Kaitlin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way I plan to return them to their owner after work.&quot; Added Laura.<br />
<br />
Kaitlin grabbed one of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful with that,&quot; warned Laura.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I just need to roll this to take years off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Laura said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Kaitlin flinched, as if something had hit her inside the head, and Laura helped her to hold on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;r okay?&quot; Laura asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...a voice...a voice spoke to me,&quot; said Kaitlin, who had never received a call directly inside her head.<br />
&quot;As I understand it, every roll of the dice will give me back my lost years&quot; Kaitlin said, recovering from her emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done Sherlock, that&#39;s literally what I explained to you&quot;. Said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well let&#39;s go then, let&#39;s see how many years I&#39;m going to lose&quot; Kaitlin said as she dropped the die on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;4&quot; said Laura, her vision being better than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;thirty-nine years you have walked this earth, now this number is but thirty-five. Each roll of the dice will return more of what has been lost&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaitlin shivered as the orbs of light Laura had mentioned appeared around her.<br />
Laura moved closer to see the wrinkles on her face become less and less prominent. Her hair also looked fresher, and fuller. Her breasts slowly rose and squeezed Kaitlin&#39;s bra a little tighter.<br />
<br />
Once the orbs disappeared, Kaitlin turned to her co-worker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura, I feel...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yes obviously I feel better but mostly younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just as obvious.&quot; Laura grinned.<br />
<br />
Kaitlin ran her hands through her long honey colored hair, it was thicker and more lively, she untied what was holding it in a bun and let it fall over her shoulders. She ran her hands along her body, even though she felt her breasts were firmer, her back straighter and her hips firmer too, there were still traces of the beginning of aging. She took a mirror out of her purse and could see her face more alive, her skin less wrinkled and smoother, but not enough. Kaitlin gave the die a little kick, and it rolled involuntarily to under a desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another roll will leave you between 34 and 29.&quot; Laura said loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I&#39;m an accountant Laura.&quot; Kaitlin replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirty-five years you have walked this earth, now this number is but thirty-two, each roll of the dice shall return more of what has been lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much but still not bad.&quot; Kaitlin said as the orbs appeared.<br />
<br />
Her appearance was becoming even more youthful as she approached her early thirties, her wrinkles had all but disappeared, her breasts were becoming even firmer and the remaining cellulite had all but disappeared from her thighs. That last roll had left her as a beautiful 32 year old woman, looking young but experienced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Kaitlin, you look fantastic!&quot; Laura said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah , I used to take regular yoga classes to stay physically fit.&quot; Said Kaitlin as she twirled on her ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m going to keep this age for now, 7 years younger is already a big number and I don&#39;t want to go back to being an intern...although the idea of being back in my 20s is very appealing to me...I mean, physically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should stay in your early thirties, my body may be great but I don&#39;t like to think about what another rotation would look like.&quot; Said Laura.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah back in high school huh? No thanks, I don&#39;t want to relive those years&quot; Kaitlin said sharply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get your die and put it somewhere safe, I&#39;ll make us some coffees and we&#39;ll get to work, I have a lot of paperwork to do.&quot; Said Laura as she carefully put her die back in the box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, don&#39;t forget my two sugars!&quot; Said Kaitlin as she bent down to pick up her die from under the desk.</p>
