<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John ducked into the nearest room upon seeing some blonde hair ascending the stairs. She hoped that Sara had not seen either her or the door to the room she entered closing. She didn’t shut the door completely for fear of it making a noise. So hid behind the partially open door and hoped Sara wasn’t going to enter this room.<br />
<br />
When the danger had passed and Sara&#39;s footsteps had moved past the door towards Bill’s room, John breathed a sigh of relief. She was safe for the moment and even better she had the medallion clutched in her hands. At least she now had possession of the artifact that would allow her to change back into her own body once she was home and could access some of her own clothes. <br />
<br />
However before that could happen she needed to get down the stairs and across to her own house. <br />
<br />
John spent a moment checking out the room she was in. Apparently it was a spare bedroom. There was a double bed in the room and built in wardrobes. There was a dressing table beside a window and John was surprised to see a feminine looking hat sitting on top of it. It was one of those funny hats that didn’t actually provide any shade. The sort that women might wear to the races. She couldn’t think what they were called.<br />
<br />
She moved around so she could look through the crack in the doorway and see if the coast was clear. It wasn’t. She spied Sara stopped in the hall outside the door to Bill’s room. She was back in the dress she had been wearing earlier but wasn’t wearing shoes. No wonder John had not had much warning of Sara coming up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Sara was talking to Bill ‘Can you spare me a hand and do up this zip. It appears to be stuck’<br />
<br />
‘Certainly’ Bill replied in his big booming voice. ‘You were quick’ <br />
<br />
John watched through the crack as Bill came out into the hall. At least he was no longer naked. He had put on the boxer shorts that John had so recently handed to him.<br />
<br />
Sara turned around and appeared to be looking down the hall towards the door John was hiding behind. John stayed as still as she could not wanting to alert Sara by movement. She had a good view of Bill step behind Sara and fiddle with her dress ‘Yes the zip has got jammed. Stay still. I will have to undo it’<br />
<br />
It took about 30 seconds before Bill managed to pull the zip down. John was aware of when that had happened as it coincided with Bill reaching around to Sara’s front and cupping her breasts.<br />
<br />
‘Don’t!’ said the apparent Sara. ‘I’m sore. Do me up!’<br />
<br />
‘Only if you give me a kiss’ <br />
<br />
Sara giggled ‘You men are never satisfied’ She turned around and gave Bill a small kiss on the lips but Bill took her in her arms and hugged her tightly giving her a full on lovers kiss.<br />
<br />
‘Surely we can do it once more before we go out. As you can see I am ready for you’ said the apparent Bill. That drew Johns attention to Bill’s boxer shorts. They were tented out hiding a massive erection.<br />
<br />
‘I am tempted but I am sore. Do up the dress and let’s go out before I change my mind. Maybe once we are back we can do it one more time before we change’ John was amused somewhat that Sara was now using the royal we. However she was also upset that she now had irrefutable evidence of Sara’s infidelity. <br />
<br />
‘I’m not sure you are going to be able to wear that. The zip is broken. We’ll have to go to the other house and find something else. It gives us a chance to find out what John has been up to. Hopefully she took my threats seriously and has cleaned up’<br />
<br />
John was a bit puzzled it had been Sara who had threatened her not Bill.<br />
<br />
Sara replied ‘Maybe I can find something in the spare room next door. Janelle uses it as her base when she is in town. She often comes down for the races and keeps a selection of clothes in the wardrobe’<br />
<br />
John had no idea who Sara was talking about. She was not aware that Sara had a friend called Janelle. And why would Sara’s friend be keeping clothes in Bill’s spare bedroom? It made John wonder at how long the affair between Sara and Bill had been happening for.<br />
<br />
Then it dawned on John. They were quite likely talking about the room she was hiding in. Suddenly the presence of that strange hat made a lot of sense to her. She rushed over to the wardrobe. Inside were a selection of colourful dresses. Shit! She had to quickly find somewhere to hide. No point hiding in the wardrobe as that was where Sara might come looking for a dress. <br />
<br />
She made a quick decision and dove behind the bed. She hit the floor just in time to be out of sight of Bill and Sara as they entered the room. As quickly as she could she silently wiggled herself under the bed and held her breath. When she knocked against an object also under the bed she had to bite her tongue as she felt a zap from the medallion she still had in her hand.</p>
