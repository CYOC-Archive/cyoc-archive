<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">// splitting this one in twain in case anyone feels like writing their own kinks into this. <br />
<br />
The two of them had a nice, long talk about their dos and don&#39;ts. It... It could get weird between them, too. It will, probably. They were pretty gay. They made their way to the storage unit. <br />
<br />
John was quickly halted by Scott.<br />
&quot;Hold there, I&#39;ll put on the robe and then we can get to the selection...&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott was gone for a few minutes as he went inside the unit. When he was back, there was an aura of power and control surrounding him, wizard&#39;s robe on majestic display.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!&quot; a cheery voice said. &quot;My, a treasured customer, please make your way into my humble abode.&quot; Scott motioned with his arms towards the door, bowing lightly.<br />
<br />
John chuckled. Scott was made for the costume. He&#39;d act like this even without the magic. John got into the unit, looking at Scott expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, good sir, is there anything I may interest you in? Don&#39;t be misled by the size of my wares, all my costumes are form fitting!&quot; Scott kept on with earnest joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kind of want to see things from a shorter perspective... Though, like, not as an animal, or child...&quot; John admitted, twiddling his index fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Did you have a specific costume in mind?&quot; Scott asked further.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, um... I&#39;m kinda unsure... Could you decide for me?&quot; John stepped forward, an innocent smile in his face as he gave a wink. &quot;I need a good expert to guide me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Of course, valued customer. My business aims to please. Satisfaction guaranteed.&quot; Scott said, reaching for a collar that once had him under a spell. &quot;Would you close the door, please? So sorry for burdening you, but it&#39;s getting drafty in here...&quot; <br />
<br />
Navigating the environment with unerring precision, he found the collar in moments. As John closed the door, he felt a collar snap on his neck.<br />
<br />
Spot jumped up in faked shock. He, naturally, expected Master to do this-. wait, Master?... So that&#39;s how it felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a good pet, Spot.&quot; Scott said, rubbing behind John&#39;s human ear. This normally wouldn&#39;t do anything for him, but some sort of magic made it feel like his Master was satisfying the biggest itch he ever had. Spot lulled out his tongue in bliss as his posture completely relaxed. &quot;Nnngh, I-. Thank you, Master...&quot; Unknown to him, a powerful suggestion was making itself true in his mind. He WAS a good pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Spot... You wanted to be small, right? Well, let&#39;s make that happen.&quot; Scott ruffled John&#39;s hair before going away to find an appropriate costume. Spot instinctually followed, but soon a soft &quot;Sit.&quot; rang in his ears like it was the most important thing he was ever told to do. He immediately sat butt-down on the floor, arms between his legs.<br />
<br />
He was completely in Master&#39;s control. He couldn&#39;t even move a muscle, stuck in this sitting pose. It felt kinda good, though. Obeying commands was what good pets did. He was a good pet.<br />
<br />
And he was also Scott&#39;s friend. Holy shit, he was pushed so far back into his mind. He felt like he was on the verge of falling asleep. Spot was the dominant force. He couldn&#39;t even think of himself as whatever his name was before. Master-. FUCK, he couldn&#39;t think of Master as not Master. His brain simply didn&#39;t let him. He was still conscious, and could feel anything, but he wasn&#39;t given enough brainpower to think complex thoughts, and he certainly wasn&#39;t in charge of any motion. All of his brain was focused on thinking happy pet thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may stand up. Undress, boy.&quot; Scott said casually, walking back holding what appears to be a small horned lizardy costume folded up.<br />
Obeying without question, he removed his clothing. He had an average build, nothing stood out, but as he undressed he felt uncomfortable standing there with his prized jewels on display. Covering his nethers with a hand, he blushed as his master scrutinized his body with a stoic gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop hiding your dick with your hands. I want to see the goods, puppy.&quot; Scott spoke assertively. Spot&#39;s pinking face turned a bright red as his arm pulled itself away from his hairy crotch.<br />
<br />
They&#39;d agreed prior that they&#39;d probably use this opportunity in order to explore sexual fantasies. They weren&#39;t planning on starting a romantic relationship, but for the two of them it was a great chance to loosen up in a way neither of them thought possible. This whole thing might as well just be one big setup for a night of passion, with their roleplaying made more believable by Uncle Jack&#39;s magic.<br />
<br />
One must imagine Uncle to have been using these costumes for a similar purpose in the past, too.<br />
<br />
Spot wanted this to happen. He was incredibly shy about it, of course, but he had a lot of lustful desires. Ones that were too embarrassing for him to admit. Even to Master. But Scott understood well, having been his friend for years. In a counterintuitive way, Spot&#39;s hesitance to state his preferences didn&#39;t mean that Spot didn&#39;t have any. It meant that Spot preferred EVERYTHING. He wanted to be done in every way. In any order. Scott caught onto this, realising that his friend, first and foremost, wanted to be USED.<br />
<br />
Scott leaned on a table, biting his lip as he took a good look at his friend&#39;s genitals. The incoherent mumblings of protest issued by Spot would make someone think that he wasn&#39;t enjoying this. No, the shaft told a different story. Standing at full attention, it must&#39;ve been six or seven inches. Probably bigger than his own, Scott thought.<br />
<br />
Spot felt hot, his old personality coming to the forefront as everything in his body screamed that this was too embarrassing to continue. But he couldn&#39;t disobey, no, not Master. Unless he tried to play loose with the orders. But that wouldn&#39;t be right...<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me take a photo, you look really cute like this...&quot; Scott said, reaching into his robe and pulling out a smartphone. He quickly opened the camera, positioning it for a vertical shot of Spot&#39;s naked body.<br />
<br />
Actually, playing loose with the orders sounded really good right now. He couldn&#39;t hide his junk with his hands, but no one said anything about the rest of his body. Turning his body away completely from Master, Spot obscured the camera&#39;s vision of his front.<br />
<br />
Scott wanted to sigh, but he didn&#39;t want to give off the impression that Spot had him beat in any meaningful way. No, this was simply a futile attempt at disobedience. Besides, the back of his friend&#39;s body looked really appetizing, too. Scott made sure to turn on sound before snapping a picture.<br />
<br />
Spot&#39;s heart sank at the noise of the digital camera, blood pumping to his shaft. M-Master was-. &quot;Now, Spot,&quot; Master&#39;s voice interrupted his thoughts, &quot;I appreciate the view, but I think I gave you an order. Are you going to turn around on your own, or should I make you?&quot; <br />
Spot listened to Master&#39;s every word, the voice taking on a flirty and content tone, Master clearly happy with the scenario at hand.<br />
<br />
Spot... Spot found this really hot. He felt himself reconnecting with full agency of his body, his mind, actions. Though it clearly wouldn&#39;t be for long. Parts of his mind whispered him to submit. He... He wouldn&#39;t. He was happy to be... u-used, b-but he was going to be a brat about it until he was broken in. He stood still, shaking his head. He heard a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around and face me, pup.&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t disobey. He felt control of his body slip from him as his feet turned around. Master was still holding a smartphone, grinning as he took another picture. He shoved it back into his pocket, the same hand then holding an oak wand once it got out of the robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not happy with you disobeying me, you must know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bullshit, he clearly was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally, I must punish you.&quot; Scott twirled the wand, faking contemplation as he stepped closer. He put the wand against the collar, staring into Spot&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every time you think of disobeying me, electricity will run through your body. Like a shock collar. It won&#39;t damage your health, but it WILL hurt.&quot; Scott smiled sadistically, booping Spot on the nose. &quot;I expect you to focus only on obeying me, pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott revelled. Issuing direct commands was fun and all, but not ordering John to do anything definitively left some of his actions up to himself. So that gave John an opportunity to disobey. Which gave Scott an opportunity to slowly strip away another part of John&#39;s agency, breaking him in until John was a happy little bottom. He figured John was enjoying this too.<br />
<br />
Spot was shocked. Well, like, not literally. His Master had somewhat of a sadistic streak, huh?... Trying to prove the validity of the claim, he thought of turning away from Master when suddenly he was jolted with a rush of pain running through his body. H-holy shit...<br />
<br />
&quot;Like that, yes,&quot; Scott said, noticing the pained squirming of his pet. &quot;Now, before you rudely disobeyed me, we were trying to get you into suit.&quot; Scott tapped at the collar with the wand, making another change to it. &quot;Put on the kobold costume. The collar should go straight through it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spot felt himself losing control of his body as it moved to put on the costume. He walked over to the table, picking up the full body suit and holding it out in front of him for a moment, noticing it must be like three feet tall at most. The red scales glinted in the light, seam on the back of the suit inviting him to step inside. Unzipping the suit, he wordlessly slipped both of his feet inside one by one. It was a very tight fit, making him feel uncomfortable as he held the rest of the suit in the air.<br />
<br />
The suit stretched effortlessly as he pulled on it to put his head and arms inside. His body felt like it was being compressed by the suit that just WANTED to return to its original size, but his size seemed to remain identical. The vision from inside the muzzled head was odd. He wasn&#39;t used to a scaled muzzle to be obstructing a third of his view. And the room seemed brighter, too.<br />
<br />
His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a zipper slowly moving it&#39;s way up his back as Master helped him put on the suit. A wave of warmth hit him.<br />
<br />
Tugging his collar with a clawed hand, he supposed that it did slip through somehow. Magic. He turned back to face his Master. His body felt like it was filling out the costume. His toes merged into three claws as his heel shot up, his index and middle fingers merged, his skull shifted and cracked to the form of a kobold, a wave of sensation hit him as some wind blew against his SCALES. He felt himself slimming.<br />
<br />
Having scales felt strange. They had very little give, the slim form lacking any noticeable fat that could be pushed into. The hard sensation was odd, too, it was akin to rubbing a very calloused spot on something like your foot, spread all over the body. Despite how weak he looked, he felt like he actually had a nice amount of strength in his legs and arms, capable of pulling himself up or quickly sprinting away. The room seemed completely lit, too, his eyes evolved for navigating cave passages with very little light. His digitigrade legs felt foreign, too, his claws digging in deeply into the floor as he struggled to find balance, making him long for a tail that&#39;s absent on the costume.<br />
<br />
His nose was much more advanced. His large nostrils on his muzzle collected a lot of information which was processed much more eloquently by his new brain. The storage unit wasn&#39;t visited for at least 14 years before the two of them arrived, the moss in the far corner of the room was edible, and Master was smelling like he was erect.<br />
<br />
Licking his new set of teeth with a forked tongue as he thought about eating some moss, he yelped as he felt Master&#39;s hand rub his crotch. It was an... unfamiliar feeling. Looking down, he saw the outline of a... slit. As pleasure hit him, his Master coaxed out a bright, ridged, red draconic penis to come out of hiding. It was much smaller than his human one, though. Like... Half as small.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look wonderful, Spot. Though, that&#39;s not a very good name for a kobold...&quot; Withdrawing his hand, Scott reached for a wand and pointed it at the collar.<br />
<br />
Ruby was beyond flustered. His Master fondled him just like that, and then he waa going to act like it&#39;s nothing?<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not done changing yet, though.&quot; Master shoved the wand into his robe before pulling Ruby&#39;s face in for a kiss, grabbing onto his scaled butt. He eagerly returned the kiss, closing his eyes, feeling Master&#39;s tongue and hands get larger and larger against his body. <br />
<br />
He felt his paws lose touch with the ground even as his muzzle remained perfectly leveled with Master&#39;s. Master&#39;s soft hands held him with in the air, squeezing the hard scaly rump.<br />
Soon, Master felt massive. He could hold Ruby just with one arm, the other arm returning to stroke Ruby&#39;s erect shaft which maintained it&#39;s size even as the rest of the body shrank. <br />
<br />
Overwhelmed with lust, he gave an agitated moan, which sounded adorable with his newly high-pitch voice, and bucked his hips.<br />
Wasting no time, Scott pulled up the 2&#39;7&quot; kobold&#39;s light body, quickly wrapping his mouth around the tiny kobold&#39;s shaft. He felt the kobold&#39;s claws grabbing the back of his head as a load of semen blew into his mouth, quickly followed by another and another as Ruby facefucked him, feeding him cum. It was rather delicious, actually. Wonders of magic. <br />
<br />
Moments later, Ruby was done. Giving his shaft a quick lick, John put the kobold down on the ground. Ruby felt euphoric, giggling to himself as he was gently placed on the floor. Master let him finish inside of him... And, looking around, Ruby was SO tiny. He just came up over Master&#39;s kneecaps, meanwhile the rest of the storage unit looked like it was a building twice the size it used to be. Most of the shelves were out of reach for him, the doorknobs were pretty high up, and the table was like a bed.</p>
