<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dear Mom &amp; Dad,<br />
<br />
It's been a real drag here at SW.M.U.  The people are all in clicks and the professors are even worse. I had great plans of doing as Dad wanted and become a teacher, but my hopes were dashed by the English Lit Prof. He's the world's biggest ego trip jerk! He wants those not in frat houses to brown nose him at every turn.<br />
<br />
Although my grades are still acceptable I thought of looking around at some part time jobs. The pay scale was lousy and hour even worse till by chance I saw a note at the student union.<br />
<br />
A Professor Haun was hiring paid volunteers for his Gene experiments. The whole thing sounded like something from an old &quot;B&quot; movie but I called and applied.<br />
<br />
Upon my first interview the Professor and his assistant asked me dozens of questions about family background. I soon could tell where the conversations were going. The two of them were worried of complications and wanted understudies' who had either no next of kin or foreign students. <br />
<br />
I told them a long story about being brought up in as an orphan. A story that almost made the assistant cry. After the interview I was sent a contract and my first check of one thousand dollars, really!<br />
<br />
It was a Thursday afternoon when I went to their Lab for my physical. I don't have classes on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays, so their testing could be more intense and allow me time to rest after each episode.<br />
<br />
It was odd how things worked out as one of the questions asked made me think back when we still had Grandpa's farm. Remember the animals, horses, ponies, cows, the bull!<br />
<br />
Professor Haun gave me an offer I, at the time could not refuse. A long term test where my studies would be brought to me at the Lab. No class workings and better yet I increased by wage to 3 thousand per month.<br />
<br />
The special test was named, Homo-Equinus-Dartmoor. I was told that the genetherpy was sent from england by the Dartmoor Society. The basic idea was to splice young human male cells and those of some equine. The resulting culture would then be processed by the Professor's D.N.A. splice theory. A final serum would be generated which when injected would give an animal embryo the genes for more mental ability.<br />
<br />
I was proud to be a part in this experiment and all was going very well till last week. James Hullen, the assistant was doing two injections of my Antibiotic drug when the professor noted that one of the syringes was filled with the H.E.D. serum.<br />
<br />
I was suddenly thrown into a type of drug shock and passed out. I came out of the coma like sleep after five weeks. The Professor had me moved to a swing room where Nurses, pretty ones, kept watch over me till all signs became stable.<br />
<br />
The Professor came in several time each day to check my vitals and for then an odd way he measured my toes, feet, and shins. I lay around for several days after that and felt really fine.<br />
<br />
It was on the Tuesday of the second week since I revived that my skin looked very tan. Each day after that my skin color darkened one shade or more till by the end of that week even the texture was changing.<br />
<br />
I asked the Professor but was ignored and he would change the subject. I knew then that the injection was making some changes and the the Prof. didn't either know what to expect or was looking forward to whatever might happen.<br />
<br />
I was moved from the swing room to a room without windows, and no visitors, except Prof. Haun and another man named Justin. My first day in that room noted no mirror on any wall. The bathroom mirror had been removed as well.<br />
<br />
My skin color continued to change darker till after another week it was a deep black and felt thicker. I had no shaver but my whiskers which Dad says is peachfuzz are coming in at a very fast rate. Some of the hairs grew out three inches. The long ones felt like almost feeler hairs like Grandpa's horse Buster had, remember?<br />
<br />
It was a bad morning when I woke up one morning, well one day, my eyes were covered in a gauze and also my hands and arms. I was strapped to the bed, a cathode jammed up my pecker, and another sort of suck pipe up my butt.<br />
<br />
Justin told me it was due to a drug interaction and that for a day or two I needed to lay quiet. I was stuck, couldn't move, can't walk around or even feel my face.<br />
<br />
It was that Sunday when the staff was off for the day that the Professor Haun and Justin came to release my bonds. The result of their visit is why I'm writing you this note of explanation.<br />
<br />
During those past days stuck in bed I experienced such leg cramps that I know I screamed. My back ached and even my groin felt different. Hands and arms seemed strange and worse of all my sense of smell and hearing became so acute it hurt when the Prof and Justin would speak.<br />
<br />
I was told to lay very still as the gauze was removed and straps let loose. Doing as told I waited for a chance to sit up and or stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, sit up and remain calm!&quot; said Professor Haun.<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes to what had to be the most terror filled moment of my entire life. Like when you about to die, my whole life's memories poured out in a flood of emotion.<br />
<br />
My legs were what I saw first. My skin was still very dark, actually black! My toes are gone as they merged into a single solid toe. Hair, black in color grows out of my feet and they are very much longer than my size 13's. My shin and upper leg now look more like Grandpa's horse than when I walked in here some weeks back.<br />
<br />
Please Mom don't cry, I'm told this isn't permanent. I was even more afraid when I saw a four foot long hair tail hanging over the bedside. My butt is very much that of what Buster had except smaller. My maleness has changed to look every bit that of a pony stallion. A leathery sheath attached to my lower abdomen looks like Buster's, only smaller. My testicles have increased to be those of a full grown male pony. I'm sorry but Doctor Michaels circumcision is all gone and the end of my pecker is flat like a horse has.<br />
<br />
The skin or hide and dark saddle brown hair covers my back and chest up to my neck and head. The tail and a mane is long flowing and jet black. My shoulders are still my own in form as though my neck in much thicker and becoming daily since like that of the Dartmoor pony serum which was injected by accident.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to report as this letter must be very long but in waking today my head is now changing alone with those boyish shoulders. I see my one toe is now a hoof on each foot. My fingers are doing what my toes did and I expect by the time you read this letter I'll be standing on all fours.<br />
<br />
Enclosed is the signed contract and a large check from the Prof. to cover future expenses of my boarding. He says you can keep the money if now due to this you don't want me back. If so he will place me with the Dartmoor society out of their Stud in Devon, England. I know it might be difficult but please let me go to England, please!<br />
<br />
Yours still in heart,<br />
<br />
Daniel</p>
