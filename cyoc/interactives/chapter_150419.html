<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eliza&#39;s Perspective:<br />
<br />
Another late night studying... Eliza could still, even if just barely, hear the sounds of Marie&#39;s latest game craze. That girl would burn the night away and never see the sun again if she could. With her essay on the ancient jungle tribes polished and ready for submission, she cut off her lamp and laid on her bed. A deep inhale, a deep sigh just like always, if she could be so carefree as the others. Especially Naomi and Marie, those two never seemed concerned about anything the word threw at them. It was quite a fanciful long-shot but, if that wish came true, she might be able to share their enthusiasm. Now she all needed was a good night&#39;s rest and a hot breakfast in the morning.<br />
<br />
The alarm clock sounded as awful as it did every morning as it brought an end to sweet dreams. This past night&#39;s dream was a relaxing evening alongside a foreign shore. Dreams will be just that though, Dreams... First thing as always, Eliza tied her hair up into a loose bun on her head. She grabbed her morning brain teaser book from its customary place by her bedside and ventured forth into the day. As always, Eve was making the finishing touches on breakfast and Naomi in her spot at the table. Naomi almost never ate breakfast with them but, she was a fixture at the table nonetheless. Without a word to either, Eliza settled into her seat and sat her puzzle book down for better concentration. Hearing that froggy voice of Marie and cheerful Eve, Eliza greeted the rest however passively, she wasn&#39;t really sure. Breakfast was doled out in the same way it was everyday, Eliza first, then Lily, followed by Marie, Naomi if she wanted any, and finally Eve herself. Number, bite, number, bite, another number, another bite, pause for a drink, repeat.<br />
<br />
After all the plates fell quiet, Naomi spoke up rummaging in her bag. Judging by the look on her face and that of Lily&#39;s, a prank was coming... Naomi sat a rather expensive looking figurine on the table with a proud grin watching for everyone to look. Without another moment gone by, she pulled the skirt and panties down to reveal that the artist or whatever didn&#39;t miss a single detail. Eliza noted quickly that it had a heart shaped mark over an intricately formed vagina. Just before the underwear and skirt were replaced, she saw that the intimate area even glistened as if already aroused. Before anyone could catch her quiet observation, Eliza rolled her eyes and settled her glasses effectively appearing uninterested. Marie had scooped up the figure with renewed vigor and scuttled off with it into her room. Lily as always scurried back into her own room to hide her embarrassment. Suppose that meant breakfast was over then as Naomi received a scolding from Eve. <br />
<br />
Eliza wrapped up her puzzle in the book, completing one every morning to keep her mind focused and made for her room. She&#39;d shower early this morning and return to her studies. Hearing the bathroom door close after her own, she assumed either Eve or Naomi had gone in. Dropping off her night clothes in their bin she heard a thud from inside the bathroom. Whoever was in their must&#39;ve fallen over and she decided she&#39;d go check on them. Wearing nothing more than her cheap underwear and a towel she reached the bathroom door. As she opened the door, ready for her turn at the shower, she saw two black undergarments on the floor. It wasn&#39;t like Eve to leave her clothes in the bathroom, must&#39;ve dropped them by accident. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eve, you left your underwear on the floor in here!&quot; She called out to let Eve know about the pieces and not because it bothered her, she just wanted to keep the laundry straightened out. Four women under one roof meant sometimes clothing got into the wrong basket. As she waited for Eve to come hustling over, she took a second to glance over the undergarments giving them a quick feel with her toes. Apparently Eve had a little wild streak of her own after all, the black bra and panties were made of incredibly smooth silk. If she wasn&#39;t mistaken, they were even seductively designed to resemble the body parts they were supposed to cover. Eliza suppressed a blush hearing Eve closing in as she noted just how detailed the front of the panties were with spread lips adorning two flowered holes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear... I could&#39;ve sworn I carried it over to my room.&quot; Eve knelt down picking the silky undergarments and stepped out of the bathroom with an apologetic look to Eliza. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I&#39;ll be more careful.&quot; She gave Eliza a customary warm smile with concerned eyes as she took the garments to her room.<br />
<br />
Eliza could never stay mad at Eve, she did so much for all of them without asking anything in return. A sweeter heart, Eliza was certain she would never find. With the door closed, Eliza dropped off her towel on the hook and deposited her underwear on the toilet lid. She didn&#39;t really need her glasses to see but, they made things less blurry, they now rested on the back of the toilet. Water streamed down from the shower head as she stepped in and lathered her shampoo starting with her hair and working her way down. There was a sound and a click over by the door, maybe Eve noticed she&#39;d left it unlocked and done it for her. With a shrug, Eliza moved down to scrubbing her arms as a pair a slender hands grabbed her breasts from behind. Barely keeping her startlement in check, she felt a face press into her back and she released a sigh instead.<br />
<br />
Marie wasn&#39;t the type to cause a rather sexual encounter but, whenever she stayed up too long, she was known to piggyback on baths. This must&#39;ve been on of these days as Eliza heard Marie&#39;s characteristic mumbling and lips brushing against her back. Eliza sighed clearing the soap first from her eyes to better see the exhausted young woman so tenderly groping her breasts. &quot;Come on then... Get up front so I can do your hair...&quot; She lathered Marie&#39;s own shampoo in her hands as they traded places and as her misfortune continued, Marie had switched around as to face Eliza. With a shake of her head, Eliza began to work the shampoo into Marie&#39;s hair and Marie sleepily leaned forward planting her face firmly in Eliza&#39;s breasts. If it ever came out that she did this sort of thing on purpose, Eliza would probably kill her. As it were, she just had to endure the soft locks of her brushing her nipples as she worked the shampoo in. Of course, the little traitors rose up with the unintentional stimulation causing a real blush from Eliza. Now she prayed that Marie wouldn&#39;t notice until she were out.<br />
<br />
Loofah already lathered for herself, she instead turned to using to wash down the absent minded Marie. Calling out for her to raise an arm or turn as needed, Eliza gently scrubbed Marie. When it came to the sensitive areas, Eliza took a deep breath and very careful scrubbed Marie&#39;s small breasts trying not to cause a stir. Now for the most challenging area, she thought to herself... The Loofah slowly working its way down to Marie&#39;s vaginal lips, Eliza once again hoped for assistance. Nothing forthcoming, she gently rubbed up and down attempting to keep from making a scene. As with the rest of her bad luck, her tactic hadn&#39;t seemed to work as she heard Marie breathing more noticeably. Without warning, Marie turned pushing them both over in the tub landing atop Eliza who lost grip of the Loofah. <br />
<br />
Eliza&#39;s thoughts raced wildly as she was quickly finding herself in the bottom position of an impromptu round of Sensual Tension. Marie&#39;s eyes were covered by her bangs as she began to grind her vagina against Eliza&#39;s leg. Unable to look away from this ordeal, Eliza watched and felt Marie&#39;s slow grind on her shin ending on her knee and sliding back down. It didn&#39;t take long for Eliza to note the hardened clit peaking her knee with each successive stroke. A short while after Marie was furtively rubbing clit along the knee selectively. Her soft moans nearly muffled by the running water as she thrust herself faster and faster. Despite herself, Eliza felt her own sex heating up and if not for the running water, growing moist. Marie didn&#39;t last much longer than she started as she stroked one final time freezing up and then releasing down Eliza&#39;s leg. This would go down as one of the most intimate yet, embarrassing memories Eliza would ever have as Marie laid out over top of her. Determined that her bath was now ruined, Eliza found the loofah and scrubbed her used leg. <br />
<br />
She let Marie lay in the tub while she dried off and then dressed in her underwear and towel to carry the nude figure of Marie to her room. The silly, sleepy girl had come in stark naked without even a towel in her sleep addled maneuver. Looking to either side to make sure the area was clear she hastened to Marie&#39;s room laying her dripping on her bed. Not much to be done for her now... As she felt the room, she heard a slight squishing sound with her ever step. Had they been so wet, they soaked the carpet along the way? Squishing sound continuing as she walked into the Living area, she reached to check her heartbeat. Soft as they were, her breasts squished under her had remarkably easily. Feeling at them in a  more investigatory manner, she noted they almost felt like silicone over gel. Next thing, she knew she fell to the floor as her body gave out. <br />
<br />
Eliza lay on the floor atop of her splayed open towel unable to do anything over than think. Her whole body felt disturbingly soft and floppy as a new sensation started. Starting with her fingers and toes, her body pulled inward and her surroundings start to enlarge about her as if she were shriveling away. With a soft set of pops, she could no longer feel limbs and next her stomach was devoured by her waist and breastline. By now the familiar living area had doubled in size while still growing ever larger. Unable to call for help Eliza panicked inwardly feeling her hips and ass pull into her waist. Next, what was her shoulders and chest pulled in just over her waist and just below her breasts she saw fuzzy hairs about as long as what was one her head sprouting up. By now the room had stopped growing and something nudged her onto her side. There a glass cup had been set on the floor beside her, the reflection within giving her a glimpse of her body. <br />
<br />
The process had left her vagina unchanged but, the rest of her body and been consumed into a ball shape centered on it. Her normal three inch slit looking large by comparison and the pubic hair had just settled into a print on of the &quot;skin&quot; as she studied herself. Above that print were two small nubs with dots on them, those were what was left of her breasts. As she studied her neck pulled down threatening to draw her head in with it. One final soft mental whimper and her head pulled into the rest of her ball like body. <br />
<br />
On the floor in the middle of the living area was a sexually designed stress ball made of high quality silicone. It featured a life sized vagina, two tiny breasts over a triangular patch of brown, and below the lips was a inward dimple depicted anus. Eve came out of her room ready to take her shower and noted the ball just shy of stepping on it. Picking it up, she looked it over before setting it on the counter for Marie to pick up later. The girl always bought the strangest toys and left them laying about as if to torment poor little Lily. Quietly shaking her head making note to tell Marie to keep better track of her toys, she wandered into the bathroom to take her shower.</p>
