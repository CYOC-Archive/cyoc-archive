<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake watched the movie for a while. Other than his new legs, head, and tail, Marcus wasn&#39;t that different from what Jake could tell. He still laughed at the same jokes and grabbed Jake&#39;s arm when something hilarious happened in the film like he always did, though he was a lot stronger than he was before. Still, other than continuing to get taller than he used to be, Jake was pretty sure nothing else would happen in Marcus&#39;s transformation. <br />
<br />
Then, a few more minutes in, Marcus went silent. Jake could hear him grunting and he turned to look at the minotaur. Marcus was rubbing the buldge in the front of his pants, groaning as it grew and strained his jeans. &quot;Uh, you doing okay man?&quot; Jake said. Marcus nodded, &quot;Yeah, keep watching the movie. I&#39;m sorry, my easy arousal always gets in the way of my focus. You know what they say, &#39;a taur&#39;s balls never empty.&#39; I&#39;m just annoyed that I have to cram the thing into these tight pants. Do you mind if I let it out my fly? I think if it wasn&#39;t so tightly frictioned up against my pants my lust wouldn&#39;t be so bad.&quot; Jake&#39;s eyes widened a little but he tried to play it as normal as Marcus was. After all, this was a new reality in which Marus being a minotaur wasn&#39;t anything new. Him needing to take care of his...needs, was probably nothing out of the ordinary, right? Jake gave a quick &quot;Yeah, no problem&quot; and tried to focus back on the movie but gulped as he looked back over at Marcus. The Minotaur&#39;s rising bull cock was sliding out of it&#39;s sheath and through the zipper of his pants. Marcus was back to watching the movie, but he was absent-mindedly giving the soda can thick rod strokes up and down it&#39;s now dripping length. Marcus humped his semi-hard 9 inches of pre-come moistened bull dick into his palm as he chuckled at another joke from the film. Jake tried to fake a smirk, &quot;Hey, uh, how&#39;s that open fly treating you? I thought you said it might help your lust go down?&quot; <br />
Marcus looked back like Jake had just asked him something as mundane as what work he had to do before finals week. &quot;Oh yeah. Well, it helps the lust go down but the erection won&#39;t until I come. I can just take it at my own pace. I find it&#39;s less weird to others if I do it this way. It&#39;s the most polite way for taurs to take care of their urges all things considered.&quot; Jake nodded slowly. Marcus shrugged, hand still moving up and down his cock as he thrust into it. &quot;If watching me do it for a long time bothers you I can just bang a load out real quick,&quot; he suggested. Jake&#39;s heart was racing but he tried to play it cool, &quot;Yeah, whatever you want man.&quot; Marcus grinned, &quot;Awesome, getting it done quicker means I can focus on the movie a bit more too after.&quot; Marcus took his pre-covered hand and grabbed the remote, pressing pause on the film so he could focus on pleasuring himself. &quot;I&#39;ll clean that up later. You know how messy taurs can be with this kind of a thing,&quot; Marcus said before he began jacking off with considerably more vigor. His bull&#39;s nostrils exhaled little grunts of hot breath as he gripped his shaft with both hands. His cock was at least a foot long now, but it showed no signs of being at full mast, the sheath still a little loose around the Minotaur&#39;s length. In fact, to Jake&#39;s shock it seemed to be getting thicker? No doubt about it, the cock was beginning to get too big for Marcus&#39;s fly as he moaned in between more breathy grunts. Jake checked the Chronivac. The screen for Marcus read &quot;Transformation still in progress. Currently updating: Sexual Organs.&quot; Jake scrolled down to look at the random settings the Chronivac had set. Marcus&#39;s length and girth stats for his cock were steadily rising, the cause of which seemed to be the random choosing of the &quot;95th percentile&quot; for &quot;average species male sex organ size&quot;. Jake did a double take. Marcus wasn&#39;t getting hard, his shaft was just growing constantly larger while reality altered itself so it was always normal for it to get that big. The Minotaur&#39;s rod was still semi-hard because the max length hadn&#39;t been set yet. Just then, Marcus gave a huff as his bull cock teared out of the fly in his jeans, all 18 inches of the now liter bottle thick bovine penis slapping him in the chest and flinging out stringy wads of bull pre as he panted with more arousal. &quot;Shit, not another pair of jeans ruined too. Well, at least I can suck it now. This thing usually goes off the fastest when I blow myself. It is annoying to get to it though. Just need to...&quot; Marcus mumbled as he craned his head towards his chest. Suddenly the last four inches of his now fully grown two feet long bull schlong grew in as the minotaur comfortably slid his bottle wide cock into his maw. With his pants ripped, Marcus&#39;s thick grapefruit swollen balls were now visible. They pulsated above the Minotaur&#39;s juicy hole, which seemed to throb with every suck that was given to the rod currently three quarters of the way down the Minotaur&#39;s throat. Suddenly, Marcus&#39;s tail plunged into his asshole, and the taur began to fuck into himself as he groaned on his own cock. After one last deepthroat of his prick that was taken almost down to the base, Marcus&#39;s nuts pulled in and gave a big throb. Jake watched the Minotaur&#39;s length sent a pulse of bovine semen up it&#39;s shaft and into Marcus&#39;s throat before the taur swallowed it all in one gulp. He pulled up and off his cock with a satisfied grunt, a geyser of bull batter shooting up right after and hitting the ceiling. Sticky ropes of hyper-virile minotaur jizz fired straight up from Marcus&#39; cock over and over as he reclined into the sofa and let his eyes blissfully roll to the back of his head. As the two foot length began to soften ever so slightly, it&#39;s shots began to shoot off in all directions. By the time Marcus was done ejaculating the entire room was covered in thick and stringy bull seed that dripped slowly off the walls and ceiling and filled the room with a strong distinctive musk. The Minotaur&#39;s cock seemed to soften more for a moment before hardening back to full force a few moments after. Marcus grinned, taking a slurp of left over come off the top of his once again rock hard bull shaft&#39;s head with his long tongue, &quot;Damn, guess I really have a lot built up today. I bet if you help me get some more out of it I&#39;ll be done a whole lot quicker that I would with just using my own hand and mouth over and over,&quot; he said, pulling his tail back out of his hole. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind maybe you could...</p>
