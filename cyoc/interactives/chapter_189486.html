<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Note the warning tag is more for mentions of things that happened in the previous chapter...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel was in a near panicked state over the whole issue as Megumi took a roll of tissue paper and began to wipe away the away the cum that Aaron had got on her.  There was some relief in that Megumi had been able to get her off of Aaron&#39;s knot and then get his penis out of her before he came, but only just barely. This could well mean that some might have gotten in her before, she would be transforming could well be facing pregnancy. Now, it wasn&#39;t entirely that she was against becoming a werefox, partially because of the report that Aaron was bonding to her, but she had bean leaning toward werebear and at the same time she hadn&#39;t formalized any decision, yet. And with the fact that she also knew she&#39;d need to get &quot;permission&quot; from her parents regardless was something that made the present situation worse in that so far she didn&#39;t think she&#39;d have permission.<br />
<br />
&quot;But how can you not know?&quot; Rachel asked as she looked to Megumi as she finished wiping Rachel clean, which including going over things with more toilet paper and some liquid soap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally we can,&quot; Aaron said nervously, looking to the stack of clothes that he knew were Megumi&#39;s sitting on the bathroom countertop, &quot;for in most situations... if we didn&#39;t get unknotted... YOU&#39;D actually be starting to change right now and would need me to complete the transformation. But a bit before Halloween there was something that happened that raised some questions on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Questions?&quot; Rachel asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A family that had been fleeing the mob came here, with a daughter who should be a junior, but because of lost time from school got moved back into the Sophomore grade with us... at least until the end of the fall semester. Her finals then will then determine if she moves on to the Junior class for the spring or stays at the Sophomore level for the rest of the year. As such... both Aaron and I got to meet her, before your friend Melissa arrived. She is fairly friendly, though she shared with us that a few days before she&#39;d been moved from her home to a cabin to the southwest of town to allow the police to set up a sting to catch the mobsters, which they did. However, while she was out there, she admits to have gotten a bit TOO forward with a weretiger out there, sort of like you first did with Aaron and again, just now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this weretiger turned her then?&quot; Rachel asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a sense yes and no,&quot; Aaron answered, &quot;she didn&#39;t have all out sex with the weretiger, but she did give him a blowjob and got a bit of pre-cum in her mouth, which she swallowed on reflex. And apparently that was enough to turn her... but because it wasn&#39;t a &quot;full load,&quot; it would appear that the volume of the were-virus in pre-cum is low enough that an immediate transformation would be triggered, but was enough that it would still happen. She stated she had weird feelings through the rest of the night and into the morning that warned her that she was already changing, just not as fast as normal. So she transformed the next night and came to school as a weretiger the following Monday... in human form, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only saving grace is that she said she already wanted to be a weretiger,&quot; Megumi spoke as she tossed the dirty tissue paper into the waste bin on the floor between the cabinet and the toilet, &quot;but we have no way of knowing WHEN her scent changed from human to were or anything like that. So... we have no way of knowing for sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel blinked for a moment and then asked, &quot;Do you smell anything now?&quot;<br />
<br />
That raised a few curious sniffs from both Aaron and Megumi.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment, you do smell human,&quot; Megumi spoke, &quot;though... given what we were told by that new weretigress... we can&#39;t be sure WHEN her scent changed from human to were, even if the physical transformation was delayed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... if the effect is enough to assure that the transformation will happen, wouldn&#39;t that effect then still be immediate?&quot; Rachel wondered, &quot;because I&#39;m not feeling any burning need right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is our reasoning, but we have no concrete proof,&quot; Megumi looked to Aaron.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might be the best line of reasoning,&quot; Aaron thought aloud, &quot;as the new weretigress sorta said she began having those sorts of dreams and warnings of her coming transformation pretty quick. We have no concrete proof for the hypothesis but it may be logical to assume that even with the lower &quot;dose&quot; in pre-cum, the effective change that would identify someone as a were would be quick to happen, and it&#39;s only the full on transformation that is delayed. Just like those that become weres through bites or scratches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bites or scratches?&quot; Rachel wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other ways humans often become weres,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;and Aaron is right there... the change in scent in those cases is quick, but the full on transformation is delayed. It may take a up to thirty minutes before one who&#39;s been bitten by a were to transform and it may take hours for someone clawed by a were to transform. Though one of our uncles has theorized that the delay in the transformation from those methods also relates to having to heal the wound first...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though he isn&#39;t completely sure on the difference between a bite and a scratch,&quot; Aaron commented, &quot;a bite would actually do far more damage, and usually why those that actually ask to be bitten usually have some kind of &quot;movie monster fetish&quot; thing going. His best guess is that there is more of the were-virus in our saliva than on the enamel of our claws... but that&#39;s still only a guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it would still prove that I&#39;m still human, right?&quot; Rachel asked, &quot;that I&#39;m not transforming and I don&#39;t smell like a were?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi and Aaron both nodded. This gave Rachel a rather heavy sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... you will need to shower again to get my scent off you,&quot; Aaron warned, &quot;your dad has actually been following your trail and is waiting outside with grandma. I believe he was already aware of you being turned on by our neighbors and whatever tension Megumi helped you with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... he&#39;s gonna kill me,&quot; Rachel groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Aaron spoke, &quot;he does have the whole nervous and protective dad vibe about him... which to a werefox, a protective werelion can be scary... but he actually seemed to accept our bond rather well... even if it didn&#39;t turn you into a werefox... more by luck than anything else... but still, he didn&#39;t throttle me and he actually seemed quite intrigued by the description of the bond.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... if my dad had taken the time to learn about weres in a more reasoned manner and learned about werefox&#39;s bonds, he might have actually gone that way with my mom,&quot; Rachel admitted, &quot;dad loves her dearly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that is good,&quot; Megumi said slowly, &quot;though still... you need to shower again.&quot; She then paused to look over to her cousin and took him by the ear, &quot;and you best go to rest on your bed. For will also be best that you don&#39;t appear with Rachel&#39;s scent all over you.&quot; Megumi then returned her attention to Rachel, &quot;the clothes for you to borrow are there on the counter. Your shoes are on the floor. And be quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel sighed and nodded as she moved to step back into the tub while Aaron was led out. He mind raced over the panic that came from how she&#39;d rather quickly plunged herself onto Aaron&#39;s member just after the first one and how little she&#39;d actually thought through things, which nearly got her into real trouble. Of course that also served to arouse her again as the hot water came on. She rapidly switched the water to cold and jumped a bit at that before taking the bar of soap and rubbing it over or chest and abdomen and feeling grateful to have dodged a bullet. This was quick with the cold water and it wasn&#39;t long before she turned the water off again and hopped out. This time she toweled off quickly to get warm and then noted the clothes that Megumi had left and began putting them on.<br />
<br />
Rachel didn&#39;t get a bra from it, but to a degree that wasn&#39;t going to be helpful simply for the fact that Megumi&#39;s bras would be a bit too big on Rachel at present. The panties and jeans felt a bit loose, but it was better than nothing. The shirt also hung a bit loose, but covered everything and that was all that was needed for the moment. Rachel finished by picking up her shoes and the socks Megumi also provided and then moved to where the toilet was. She then lowered the seat and the top and sat on it to put the shoes and socks on. Once that was done, she came out to the door and found Megumi waiting there with Rachel&#39;s backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot; Megumi asked handing the backpack to Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;My hair&#39;s still a bit damp and I&#39;m nervous about what my dad will say,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;but I&#39;m about as good as I&#39;ll ever be... and I probably smell like soap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit,&quot; Megumi admitted, &quot;but it&#39;s also better than smelling of lust and sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded and they soon made their way downstairs and toward the back door. There were a few dressed members of the Tachibana family in some of the other rooms on the first floor, and they were looking out toward the windows that overlooked the backyard. Megumi lead Rachel past them and to the sliding doors that lead them out. As they came out, Rachel then caught on to the sight of a large male werelion, fully transformed with folded clothes under one arm and his shoes held on two fingers talking with Akane Tachibana most of it seemed be about parenting from little Rachel could pick up, but it was enough for her to recognize her father&#39;s voice. Like Melissa&#39;s, his voice was deeper than before, though her father&#39;s voice had also gained a slight growling edge to it. Though Melissa assumed that had more to do with her father becoming a werelion. She also noted that his mane was actually thicker on the front of his neck and upper chest while thinner on the back of his neck and that the skin on his belly seemed either very loose and flat.<br />
<br />
&quot;He dad,&quot; Rachel said slowly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry about getting lost...&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard turned his head toward her and took one sniff, and found that Rachel was still human. Though he also noted that the teen werefox vixen that had lead Rachel out was also the same one that had lead her here. A part of him wanted to be mad about Rachel wandering about on her own and potentially getting herself into the same trouble he&#39;d gotten himself into, but for the moment he was thankful to see that she was alright. At the same time, Akane no Tachibana had provided relatively decent company.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad your safe,&quot; Richard said to her, &quot;and that your friends here didn&#39;t force anything on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Aaron?&quot; Akane wondered after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I gave him a bit of a hug, and well, I think he got a bit love sick after that,&quot; Rachel answered, which wasn&#39;t necessarily a lie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Akane said slowly, &quot;well, the bond is powerful and while it&#39;s not unheard of for young werefoxes to find their bonded mate quickly, it&#39;s still quite strong when it does hit. You will be kind to Aaron, regardless of what were you become in the future, Ms. Van Direstag?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;and he&#39;s seemed fairly smart and friendly. Though it does leave me with plenty to think on on what were to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to drag you out around town, dad,&quot; Rachel said slowly to her father, &quot;I should have at least called when I left Melissa&#39;s. For it seems like it&#39;s gotten you pulling your mane out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My form is based on the Asiatic Lion,&quot; Richard answered, &quot;which has a thinner mane on the back of the head and neck, a thicker tuft on the tail, and a loose fold of skin on the belly. Though you DID have me worried... but, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re alright. And we should get going. Your mother and brothers should have dinner ready by now... more than ready... and there are other things that your mother and I need to share with you and Rob.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard then turned to Megumi, &quot;I thank you for helping my daughter.&quot; He then turned to Akane, &quot;and I thank you for your hospitality, but we&#39;d best be going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded while Megumi moved to open the back gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your clothes should be clean by the time after school tomorrow,&quot; Megumi said to Rachel, &quot;you can pick them up then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel nodded and then followed her father out as he then lead her north and with the Van Direstag house clearly in view from the back fence of the Tachibana estate.</p>
