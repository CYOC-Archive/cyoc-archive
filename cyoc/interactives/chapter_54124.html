<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Collin was taking what he felt was the long to Stacy's place, a house and person he wasn't exactly looking forward to spending any time at, but seeing as his mother was to be out of town on business for the next week, Collin saw no other alternative short of disobeying his mother's wishes.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Collin, kicked at a pile of debris, dragging his feet as he moved along, lost in thought.<br />
<br />
At the age of ten, he had been staying with Stacy...who was now about twenty five and about to start college...since he had been about five years old. Which was unfortunate, because she was the only person that Collin's mother knew and trusted to act as a babysitter while she was out of town.<br />
<br />
What Collin's mother didn't know, was that Stacy and her friends made Collin dress and act like a girl, which Collin's appearance didn't help because of the fact of how he looked like a girl and even had a girl's build.<br />
<br />
Sighing, hating how manipulative Stacy could be, Collin kicked at another pile of debris, wishing that there was some way he could get out of going to Stacy's.<br />
<br />
A clinking noise and Collin watched as a hunk of metal was dislodged from the debris he had just kicked and moving over to it, he noticed that it was some sort of trinket or costume jewelry and leaning down, Collin picked it up.<br />
<br />
Reading the inscription, Collin thought it interesting and brushing the crud off using his shirt, he slipped it around his next and continued on his way.<br />
<br />
eighteen minutes later, he was stepping into Stacy's home, wondering if her friends where here yet, hating that he had to be treated like he did in front of them, barely listening as Stacy asked, &quot;Did you bring you vitamins?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, not really believing that they the medicine he took were actually vitamins...he had been taking them since the age of five after Stacy started him on them and had forged a note from the school nurse, which said it was recommended that he take them, which his parents had bought completely...he listened as Stacy told him, &quot;Well, leave your stuff hear and come up to my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Collin was greeted by Brie, Marcia and Izzi, who grinned, each holding an article of clothing.<br />
<br />
Behind Collin, Stacy closed the door to her room as she said, &quot;You know the drill. Strip,&quot; as she took her place next to Brie, watching as he started to undress.<br />
<br />
Naked, hating that these four girls took pleasure in making his do this, Collin listened as Brie commented, &quot;That's a pretty necklace,&quot; as Izzi squealed out, &quot;It will go nice with the outfit we have,&quot; while Marcia announced, &quot;The vitamins he has been taking are working greet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, Collin took the shirt that Stacy handed him, barely seeing that it was pink with white sleeves and had a floral pattern stitched on the front.<br />
<br />
Pulling it over his head, he gasped as it touched the amulet and a flash of light that he thought might be static electricity occurred when it touched his skin. Unsure, he finished pulling on the shirt, hating how it felt against his skin.<br />
<br />
Looking at the four girls, waiting for the next article of clothing, stopping and noting for some reason that the girls looked taller then normal, he asked, &quot;What,&quot; as they stared at him.<br />
<br />
Slowly their looks shifted to wonder as Izzi squealed out, &quot;So cute,&quot; and Marcia asked, &quot;How is this possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down, realising that they weren't growing taller, but that he was shrinking, Collin gasped out as his body slowly started to alter itself and the shirt he was wearing, which was tight to begin with, loosened a bit.<br />
<br />
And then he gasped out as he watched as his penis and testicles brightened to a reddish-white and then began to shrink.<br />
<br />
Giggling, Stacy asked, &quot;Is what happening what I think?&quot; and before Collin could stop them, the four girls grabbed a hold of him and forced him to lie down.<br />
<br />
Giggling, moving his legs apart, the girls squealed out as they watched his penis and testicles merged with the area betwixt his legs, which immediately started to bubble outward and then split as the vulva formed.<br />
<br />
Groaning, Collin placed a hand on his abdomen as he felt a strange sensation, while Izzi cried out, &quot;I told you those clothes where for a younger girl,&quot; while Marcia exclaimed, &quot;He looks like a seven year old girl,&quot; as Stacy removed the necklace, being careful not to touch Collin or the clothes she was wearing.<br />
<br />
Moments later, Collin was forced to stand and before she could stop the other girls, she found herself being forced to wear a pair of Hello Kitty panties and pair of pink, cotton pants that matched the shirt she was wearing. As Stacy hid the amulet, the other girls cooed and fawned over him, gently running their hands through his now long, brunette hair and playing with his tiny hands.<br />
<br />
Wanting to cry, Collin squealed out, &quot;I am not a girl! I do not want to be a girl!&quot; as Stacy grinned and replied, &quot;But you are so cute! And you are going to remain that way, Lisa,&quot; and giggling, she collects Collins clothes.<br />
<br />
Watching, scared stiff, Collin watches as Stacy hands the clothes to Izzi and announced, &quot;Dispose of these!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking down, hating what has happened, Collin thinks of the amulet and wondered how she could retrieve the medallion back as Izzi left the room. Looking up, she glanced into the mirror Stacy kept in her room and noticing how she looked, Stacy, Brie and Marcia began to discuss clothes.</p>
