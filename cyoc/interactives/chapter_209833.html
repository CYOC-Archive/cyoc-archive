<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Damon slowly munched on grass and let his mind wander, his thoughts becoming submerged with the more mundane concerns of being a bovine, he reflected that this life wasn&#39;t so bad. His needs were primary, sure, but their simplicity made them attractive. Being a bull had many advantages! Well, if a bull had an owner such as Ellie. She&#39;d never sell him to a butcher. He&#39;d be a well-kept bull and she had made him so big and strong that he&#39;d be in high demand to inseminate cows in no time! He&#39;d have a harem! Of cows but a harem nonetheless! And Ellie promised him that he&#39;d not be just handled to collect his semen. Oh no, he&#39;d get to mate with the actual cow! Only the nest and most natural for him! And life was good. The air was fresh, the grass plentiful and he was sure to have good hay and plenty of fresh water, and a clean stall, all the time. No rent to pay. No worries to please ladies. No work to go to. No retirement or old age to ponder about. He wads a strapping young bull, prized by Ellie and valued by all. He&#39;d heard farmers ask Ellie about him already and how much she&#39;d take for a coupling with their heifers and cows. Damon wanted to laugh and say that they needed worry, plenty of energy and time and stamina and little swimmers for all the girls around! Just get in line, ladies! Farmers even said that it was enormous bulls like him that made ancient societies proud, the great representations of important figures in the Mediterranean world. Damon made people remember why bull had been such important symbols of power, virility and nobility. His beautiful dark brown coat made him glow with pride. All these compliments! He never had as many when he was human. Sometimes he bellowed and stamped his front hooves, impressing all around his field. He felt so prideful over his new form and proportional incredibly large sheath, penis and testicles that he stopped caring urinating and passing waste in front of everyone and without even realizing it. Life was good and he was admired, soon to be sought after by females. What could he regret of being a human next to that?<br />
<br />
As Damon was settling very easily into his new life, his two pals went out to the witch&#39;s house. They had seen no news of Damon in newspapers or in rumours or gossip. Did that old hag kill him? Was he still a prisoner, tortured by that ugly crone? They did not know but they had to find out. So they broke in again. Little did they know Ellie had observed them all along in her crystal ball. She knew what they were up to. It was easier to let them come and then capture them. She had plans for them. Plans to punish them. She had prepared two potted plants at their intention and she hid silently in the dark of her bedroom. <br />
So when Chris and John entered silently, only noticing a new bull in the field outside, they called out for Damon, expecting an answer. Hoping for one. All they got was a door slamming behind them and locking itself firmly into place. They jumped in fright and Ellie turned on the light, grinning. They screamed, asking to know who she was and where their friend was. She laughed, changing herself momentarily into the old woman of before. She switched back before the awestruck eyes of the two young men and explained calmly that Damon was in the field. The two burglars looked at the bull again and understood. They shouted out their pleas and begged for forgiveness, assuring the witch that they would never do it again. And to please not change them into cows. Ellie just laughed harder. Her eyes glowed.<br />
&quot;Oh, I believe you completely. But I can&#39;t leave you unpunished.&quot;<br />
She snapped her fingers and the two potted plants green very long vegetal leafy tentacles and each seized the two burglars, dragging them to themselves on each side of the room. In each plot, a bud grew out, with a big mouth, similar to a carnivorous plant, and it was smiling evilly and quite hungrily. <br />
&quot;Damon has accepted his new life fast. I&#39;m sure you shall too. But in the meantime, a little punishment is in order. You did commit a misdeed, no matter what you now promise not to do.&quot; <br />
The plants&#39; tentacles had effectively wrapped themselves around the two men, immobilising them. They shifted and squirmed but to no avail. Their grunts just seemed to excite more the plan&#39;s heads, which approached them, showing teeth and a large purple tongue. The two young men then begged not to be eaten. Ellie simply smiled and let the plants do their work. To the burglars&#39; surprise, relief but soon horror, the plants proceeded to not eat them but... tickle them. The large tongues started at first and poked them under the chin, continuing with long teasing twirls on the neck. For Chris and John the torture had begun. The plants wanted to to tickle them into submission and were happy to map out every sensitive nerves of their epidermis. The teasing never ceased and the mouths were happy to laugh themselves, kissing and blowing wet raspberries on their quivering bellies. Soon the plants had discarded all of their clothes but nudity was the last thing on their minds. They became Oblivious to each other, let alone Damon who himself was more preoccupied with chewing his cud than what was happening in the house of the nice human woman who looked after him. Chris pleaded for the tickle torture to halt but John merely went on calling Ellie every foul names he knew. The leaves of the plants acted like so many fingers and feathers. The mouths spoke too, commenting to their victim their actions. One privileged chuckling &#39;coochie coochie coo&#39; over and over again, letting its feather like leaves poke, prod and glide on Chris&#39; armpits and running little circles, light brushes really, on his stomach. It had discovered its weal spots and planted big wet kisses on his cheek, cooing and talking babyishly. It congratulated him for being such a good little tickle toy, as little tickle toy boy. It even started to cradle him gently back and forth, promising him lullabies and more kisses and hugs. Chris shouted through his giggles that he was not a baby but as he could barely do anything but squirm and giggle, the plant had fun teasing him with sweet words normally destined to babies. Though John was being teased mercilessly too. His swear words had been likewise muffled, but here the plant took a different approach. As its exploration of John went on, it was surprised by a jolt and pleading of his prisoner, followed by a high-pitched scream. It probed and caressed where this most sensitive part was and it had hit a sensitive spot indeed. It wriggled a tendril between the two sacks of flesh and caressed lovingly the shaft of skin, peppering the whole area with little kisses. John begged not to be touched there but his words egged the plant on. From its point of view, any sensitive part was worth exploring and this was just so much that... And... This animal&#39;s reaction was not one that could recall, ever. The soft touches and glides was making the shaft of flesh... swell. Getting harder. Getting more...erect. It was standing to attention! Perfect to give it more little licks and smooches! More surface! And the animal in its grasp squirmed and jolted, assuredly in delight, when the plant&#39;s leaves squeezed lightly and fondled the two little sacks of flesh beneath the shaft. Poking them and wriggling a tentacle at them made them swell a little too. Oh! The animal must be happy! Very happy indeed! It giggled so! Ah... This one loved a little tease, it appeared. Perfect, because the plant just adored offering them. It soon discovered that feet were the best place to do that and it went about its task like a real pro. At first, John&#39;s curling of his toes was funny, their upside could be tickled and caressed but tickling them underneath with a leaf to force them upward was a fun that became a little too bothersome. No matter, the plant slid a wine to spread the toes and immobilize them forcefully. It glided its tongue along the arc of John&#39;s feet, twirling a leaf upon the balls of his feet and kissing almost amorously his toes. It teased his skin remorselessly, with the softest of brushes first then increasing the pressure, slowly and methodically. It wriggled the tip of it tongue rapidly on these toes and even suckled on them, tickling them with its tongue straight from inside his mouth. Encouraged by the roaring of laughter in response to its careful and loving ministrations, it swallowed John&#39;s entire foot at a time, letting its tongue glide and poke at its leisure, using its sharp teeth cleverly to do such light scratches that John was hiccoughing and tearing up in laughter. He become a real twitching, giggling and sobbing mess, just like Chris. Eventually, seeing their sorry state, Ellis ordered the two plants to stop. <br />
&quot;The direct punishment is over, boys. Now, what transformation should you receive to perpetuate the fate you deserve for being such bad boys?&quot;</p>
