<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad spent the next couple years on all fours. Seemed that Nick wasn&#39;t the only one who wanted to stud the bitchboi quarterback.  Master Geoff had revealed that Chad had gotten pregnant at his going away party. There was a good chance Nick was the sire, but no guarantees, since he was paying 5 grand, Geoff let him stud Chad for a few weeks until the dog boy&#39;s belly began swelling. Besides Geoff enjoyed watching Nick&#39;s rough romancing of his former rival on the CCTV. Then rewatchibg the videos.<br />
<br />
Chad gave birth to 5 male puppies. They were nearly weaned when Coach Sinclair showed up with his dog Brutus.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s tits were sore for the constant pregnancies and weanings. He had no concept of the passage of time and barely remembered being human.<br />
<br />
Chad woke on the dog bed feeling oddly refreshed. He was completely human. At first he assumed that he was going to be studded, but as his hand explored his crotch, he was surprised to discover he was all male for the first time since his father sold him.<br />
<br />
The door opened, and Master Geoff&#39;s dog groomer entered with his basket of implements. Chad was soon naked on his back on a workbench next to a sink in a utility room.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s crotch and pits were shaved. Then he was waxed, and spray tanned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master wants you to look like the sexy stud you used to be, bitchboi,&quot; sighed his groomer/trainer. &quot;So I guess 6 hours a day in the gym to start.&quot; He grabbed the half inch of fat around Chad&#39;s belly and pinched it..<br />
<br />
Chad blinked as he caught a glimpse of himself in the gym mirror. He focused on the workout. He focused on the pain.<br />
<br />
At the end of the month, Chad ached all over, but he had never been so buff <br />
<br />
&quot;Good work, Marty,&quot; Master Geoff said inspecting Chad for the first time in person since Chad had been fully male. &quot;Chad really looks like a stud. Be a pity to get rid of that big old cock of his, wouldn&#39;t it? Well, we&#39;ll see of he still knows how to use it. Has he jacked off at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No siree, he has been a good bitch boy and not touched itself once. But it appears to have had some wet dreams based on the state of its blanket,&quot; Marty replied.<br />
<br />
Chad looked downcast.  Marty still thought of it as an it instead of a him. For that matter, Chad thought of itself as an it now too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Chad, today&#39;s the big day. Your pups are going to become men. Nicky brought his pick of the litter, as did Coach Sinclair. Should we head down to the kennels, Chad? Are you ready to meet the horn dogs you sired an weaned? We&#39;re going to have a round Robin submission wrestling competition.  You have to top one of your boys to keep your cock. Personally, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re man enough, Chad. Look at the drool dripping from your mouth. You&#39;ve been salivating in anticipation of sucking my cock since I entered the gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad swallowed, and answered, &quot;Master Geoff, do you want me to suck your cock, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff just grinned, &quot;on your knees, bitchboi, and do what you do best.&quot;<br />
<br />
With cum dripping from his mouth. Chad plodded silently behind Geoff and Marty as they led him naked to the kennels. <br />
<br />
The first chainlink cage contained Wicked, Nick&#39;s dog. It looked like a Rottweiler mix.  As they stood there watching. Wicked began to shift and change. He still had hair on his head and face, pubes, and crotch but otherwise was smooth and muscled. He was only a little over two years old, but he looked like he was 24 or 25. As he changed, Chad&#39;s cock had stiffen and.risrn to full mast. <br />
<br />
Wicked growled and leapt at the chainlink cage door. He grabbed the link openings with his hands, and pressed his naked muscled body up against the chainlink, ramming his erection through an open link.  He sniffed, and growled,  &quot;I smell bitch.&quot; He smacked his lips, &quot;Want bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon,&quot; answered Geoff. Then he advanced to the next cage. He signaled with his hand, and the second mutt started to become human.<br />
<br />
The third dog to become human leaned toward Chad, and commented on the dried cum on his chin, &quot;so bitch boi likes eating cum, I got lots to feed it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Geoff mentioned that all the dogs had been trained to top male dogs, and now that they were human, he would see which were tops like their fathers or cunts like their mother.<br />
<br />
Chad had a mixture of feelings. These weremen were his offspring, and they were going to rape him, if he didn&#39;t rape them first. They were only two years old, but most of them looked older than he did. He looked down at his cock. He didn&#39;t want to lose it. Master Geoff was sure he would. He was a total bitch boi, cunt wasn&#39;t he? Damn, these guys were hot.<br />
<br />
The scene was repeated again, and again until the stood in front of the last cage.</p>
