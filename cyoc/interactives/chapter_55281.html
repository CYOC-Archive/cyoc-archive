<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mother Glen's return to the medical area was somewhat quieter then the first. She bumped in Jensen on the way out. He had just completed his official visit and had thanked the pride for helping his Pack while commending the Pack's bravery. Gillie half expected an apology for stupidly playing around with the game which ultimately caused the battle to begin with, but as reality had likely already shifted for the bulk of the Pack and the Pride, it was obvious that Jensen had never been Jennifer Smith II, he had ALWAYS been Jensen, presently the Pack's Alpha Male. He wouldn't know what to apologize for.<br />
<br />
Gillie only sighed, and hoped that neither the present wolves nor the pride asked too many personal questions, as until the game was killed and she could try Jacob's idea of hypnotism. If it worked, she guessed reality would piggy-back on the hypnotism and let her truly join the pride rather then simply playing along as a result of Penny's freeing her grandfather... who apparently had been seeing Penny's grandmother when he'd been turned into a teapot.<br />
<br />
Their arrival led to a slight hush falling over the medical wing. The pride in respect and almost reverence for Mother Glen, and the wolves out of respect for guests and the surprise at seeing Gillian, as even Millie had heard Mr. P's lectures on honor and respect and how Jessie lacked both.<br />
<br />
Gillie was about to slip off of Mother Glen's back when she was caught from the side by two dirty blond paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, Chief,&quot; Fran spoke as she moved to help the copper lioness up, &quot;what brings you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gillie glanced at the blond and busty she-wolf and guessed this was either Fran or Darla and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone here is either bandaged or in casts, or both, and you ask me what I'm doing here?&quot; Gillie responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see the reason,&quot; Fran answered, &quot;but I'd thought you'd be busy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Gillie answered, &quot;May I ask how long you and... Darla will be taking time off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until Julie isn't needing us to help with the round the clock medical care,&quot; Fran answered.<br />
<br />
Gillie only sighed and turned to survey the casualties. She noticed, but ignored the badges with the Hardys, guessing that was somehow another alteration in reality. She then cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure how to put this,&quot; Gillie began, &quot;as it's mostly for those officers under my command... I'm sorry for the loss of Fox and Elise... but I must commend you for willingly helping the Pack save Glendale from the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was what we had to do, chief,&quot; Sasha spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Gillie sighed, &quot;my prime mission, though at the moment, it to let you know that until you can heal you will have to go on an official medical leave... other then that, I'm here to see how you are doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As well as can be expected, chief,&quot; MJ told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And would also like to add that it would appear that even more recently, a certain officer has given me a very precious gift,&quot; Gillie spoke as she glanced to Penny directly, &quot;which has lead to some other interesting revelations that were unknown to me at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were several glances among the pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to introduce to you Gillian Daleson II, my grandfather,&quot; Gillie spoke, hoping this was the way &quot;Gillie&quot; behaved, as she was sure this wasn't the way she would have behaved as a male, &quot;former mate to... Mother Glen...&quot;<br />
<br />
The gasps of surprise were almost deafening as Gillian stepped forward beside his granddaughter, partially from learning who he was, and the revelation that Gillie and Penny were related.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're like sisters!&quot; Lexi said to Penny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really, and it'd only be &quot;half&quot;... I think it'd actually be cousins, anyway,&quot; Penny said, &quot;Gillie's father and my father are half-siblings. Our connection is only through our grandmother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, thank you Penny,&quot; Gillie spoke, &quot;the way you brought it up was quite a surprise, but thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime,&quot; Mother Glen then spoke up, &quot;My younger granddaughter's efforts have done more then merely restore another member of the pride to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother Glen nuzzled Gillian's side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since Penny's grandfather's passing, I have been single,&quot; Mother Glen then spoke, &quot;but thanks to my younger granddaughter, my first love is with us again, and it would be my honor if he would be my Prime Mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be my honor,&quot; Gillian turned to her, &quot;so long as you can tolerate me as young as I am by comparison...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother Glen only leaned against him as those that were able cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Fran said from where she was standing, speaking for the Pack since Jensen had to turn to the Pack's various business ventures, Kaylee was either with her pups or moving to help her husband, and her sisters were sleeping, and as a Beta, it was Fran's responsibility to speak for the Pack when the Alphas were unavailable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, congratulations!&quot; various lions chorused at the news, even Mal'akh and the other freed Gallery lions.<br />
<br />
Mother Glen paused slightly at the praise and noticed the plum blossom colored she-wolf bow politely from her position behind Penny's wheelchair and beside Kirk. She guessed this was whatever penance that Yamato had insisted on for his mistakes at the Gallery.<br />
<br />
&quot;And like your Chief, I must also commend you for your actions against the curse,&quot; Mother Glen then spoke, &quot;The Transform or Dare curse has been an enemy of the civilized world since was laid down. The enemy of the Lupmen, of Leomen, of Felmen, of Humans, of Dragons, and of Gargoyles. It has ruined lives made many miserable. And you bravely stepped into the breach when the curse threatened to destroy us all...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad shuddered at the memory of being mutated into something other then a Leoman male. He, after all, felt he had to be a Leoman male to protect his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in doing so, you helped the Pack do all civilization a tremendous favor,&quot; Mother Glen continued, &quot;You have done everyone proud, and that makes me proud to be your Pride Matriarch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheers erupted once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as much as I would like to stay and help... my paws are not of much use and I do not wish to be underway,&quot; Mother Glen then spoke, &quot;and with Gillian back, I must help him settle back into one of the Pride's homes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't I move in with you?&quot; Gillian whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been running a nursing home in my spare time,&quot; Mother Glen whispered, &quot;which has startled some of the residents there when they learn I'm older then they are, but that's a different issue. There isn't that much room in it though, barely enough for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stay with me, Grandpa,&quot; Gillie volunteered, &quot;at least until you and Mother Glen find a place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me grandma,&quot; Mother Glen said to her, &quot;we're family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A moment, Matriarch!&quot; Arael called from her bed, &quot;don't go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother Glen looked up, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Arael answered slowly, &quot;Armisael, Gabriel, Mal'akh, and I would like to talk to you for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;She accepted Draco that quickly?&quot; Abbey asked, &quot;she rejects Katherine for fear that the felman would get hurt at best but she accepted Draco?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie didn't have much choice,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;without magic of her own, Draco was the only one who stood a chance of getting close enough to the witches to either kill or drug them, depending on what was required. And Draco did have a point. The Council that Marie followed would not just let her go if she just left without notice or permission... which would have meant her death at their hands if and when she returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Draco was able to convince them to send her?&quot; Lilly asked, sounding hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Draco secured a post as a missionary from his own superiors,&quot; Marie explained, &quot;and then requisitioned Marie and Vatican to open an office for the Inquisition at his new post, since Glendale was dominated by Puritans, those that the Catholics considered heretics. Katherine would eventually be given permission under the premises of starting a convent in Glendale to go alongside Draco's &quot;mission&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long did this take?&quot; Lawrence asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It took Draco time to persuade his own superiors to accept his proposals, as the Vatican didn't want to ignite a war with Britain,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;but the eventually did allow it, and while Marie's Council didn't like the request, they would accept the request for Marie and Vatican as the main Inquisitors for this mission... but it took time.&quot;</p>
