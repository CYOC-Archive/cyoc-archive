<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uh, Ty...&quot; Mrs. Paulson gulped. &quot;How about... how about you put me down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay.&quot; Ty blushed and sweated, carefully rising from the couch with the shrunken mom and placing her on the coffee table in the middle of her living room.<br />
<br />
The woman stood at a little over three feet tall, covered in a robe that pooled around her, and hugged herself in worry. &quot;Do... do you think I&#39;m going to grow back? It was almost like I was reversing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Ty kneeled down in front of her, making her tingle again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-oh!&quot; Eileen gasped, trying to stay calm, terrified. &quot;I feel it again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of making her go bigger again, Ty willed her smaller than ever.<br />
<br />
She gasped in mortified shock and watched helplessly as she began to shrink. The coffee table grew closer to her perspective and the room grew bigger. She looked up at Ty and whimpered, holding her hands to her mouth in terror at two feet tall... and then surpassing it.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Paulson&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at a giant Ty looking down on her reduced body. She fell to only 12&quot; tall as her housecoat gathered around her and her arms slipped from the holes. She tried to cover herself as if wrapped in a giant blanket, and eventually gave up in frustration at the mess of heavy oversized fabric. She sighed in an adorable high pitch and stared at Ty meekly, blushing sheepishly as she tried to protect her modesty.<br />
<br />
Ty simply kneeled and stared in amazement as Mrs. Paulson cowered in her giant housecoat. They met gazes and she saw the way he was staring at her. He couldn&#39;t help it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty...&quot; Eileen cautioned, finding the humor despite her situation. &quot;D-Don&#39;t you get any funny ideas!&quot; Mrs. Paulson raised a tiny finger and pointed warily. Her voice was octaves higher and squeaky. &quot;Even if I sound like a chipmunk on helium.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty laughed and blushed. &quot;Okay. I&#39;ll try to behave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It... it doesn&#39;t seem to...&quot; She stared at herself in shock and gulped. &quot;Well, it... it seems to be at random, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; She began to sweat nervously, tiny droplets forming over her brow, and gulped. &quot;But... but... if I go any smaller, Ty...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; Ty took a deep breath. &quot;At least I&#39;m here, right? I won&#39;t let you get lost. We&#39;ll... we&#39;ll keep you safe, all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty chose that moment to let her tingle again. The tiny woman gasped and braced herself for another size change. &quot;Oh, no! No! No no no!&quot; She said in a panic. &quot;It&#39;s happening again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty had no intention of hurting Mrs. Pauslon at all. Nor did he want to shrink her to nothing. Now he wanted her big. Huge. Let&#39;s go the other way.<br />
<br />
The mom blinked and let out a whimper as she began to change again. But instead of smaller she was becoming bigger. With a gasp, she held her housecoat shut as she raised again, quickly growing back to two feet tall and slowing down considerably. They jointly stared in wonder as Eileen slowly grew. She crunched and popped and rasped as all of her expanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m growing!&quot; She whispered, as if scared to jinx it. She looked up at Ty excitedly, still holding her housecoat closed, and let out a smile of relief as she hit three feet. She noticed the boy&#39;s obvious wood bulging between his legs and blushed deeply. Ty looked away.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, he turned back to find Eileen standing in front of him, staring into his eyes tenderly as she put a hand on his face. She chuckled. &quot;Don&#39;t be shy.&quot; She whispered. &quot;I know you think I didn&#39;t see you staring at me all these years, but now I know why.&quot; Still, she was growing. Back to four feet tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What...&quot; Ty went deep red and watched Mrs. Paulson nervously gulp as she rose above him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know.&quot; She said nervously, hugging herself. &quot;This is all really strange.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Eileen returned to five feet tall, still slow growing, Ty stood up and stared up at her again with bewildered blinks.<br />
<br />
She returned the expression with blushing terror. &quot;Let&#39;s, uh... not think about that for a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay.&quot; Ty agreed. They jointly took a deep breath and then released it as the mom returned to her normal six feet tall. She adjusted her housecoat, tied it off, and then sat back on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank goodness!&quot; She exhaled. &quot;I&#39;m me again!&quot; Tingle. Her eyes widened. Tingle. Her body began to grow beyond its normal size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot; Ty mock whispered, trying to hide his smile.<br />
<br />
Eileen stared in shock as suddenly she surged forth. She barely had a moment to register she was growing before her head hit the ceiling. Her housecoat snagged for a moment as she outgrew it and then tore to shreds. This left a very startled and very naked Mrs. Paulson sitting on the couch hunched over in her own living room.<br />
<br />
She blinked several times, her jaw dropped. She looked over herself in disbelief and then back at Ty. Trying to cover herself was useless. She sighed in defeat and slumped down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, get a good look, young man. I don&#39;t think we can cover this up.&quot; In annoyance, she exhaled sharply and smiled at Ty&#39;s leering expression.<br />
<br />
She finally laughed and put her arms across her now massive tits, shutting her legs and smirking. &quot;At least pretend you&#39;re not enjoying this, Ty.&quot; She smirked wider. &quot;Although, I&#39;d rather take bigger than smaller.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty oogled the brazillian goddess and then finally looked away in shame. He was harder than he had ever been before. Eileen, giant on the couch, simply sat and tried to resist the tension. &quot;This is... uh, quite strange, huh?&quot; She said awkwardly. &quot;First, tiny. Then huge. I suppose I know how poor Alice felt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice wasn&#39;t that nice to look at.&quot; Ty offered, blushing deep red.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was more your age, though.&quot; Eileen said pointedly, breaking down and rubbing the sweat from her brow. &quot;Oh, Ty, what am I going to do?&quot; She slid off the couch and covered herself the best she could, grabbing her now tiny night gown and placing it over her groin. &quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know.&quot; Ty lied again, trying not to laugh. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, me neither!&quot; Eileen admitted. &quot;I thought this sort of thing was impossible!&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, Ty started the tingling again. Eileen gasped sharply and began to tremble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again?&quot; Ty turned, eyes wide. He was getting good at playing this game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes!&quot; She spat quickly, clutching herself in fear. &quot;But... but which way?&quot;</p>
