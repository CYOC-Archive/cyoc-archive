<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ah fair,” Dan replied, “I do need a break anyway… um… coz…” He stumbles over his words as he struggles to find a way to explain to the fourteen year old boy that he needed to relive his balls from the massive amount of cum that had built up over the time Gavin had been here.<br />
He decides just to be blunt, “I really need to release some of this build up, could you do me a favour and head into the kitchen for a bit and grab us a few snacks?”<br />
“Oh , ah yeah of course.” Gavin agrees, sliding off Dan’s balls and wanders into the kitchen.<br />
Relieved he has a quick moment to himself, Dan flipped off the blanket and started wanking his hard cock. <br />
<br />
Gavin spied in from the kitchen. He knew he couldn’t miss out seeing what was about to happen, he found the idea way too hot. From his vantage point, he could see Dan’s massive balls and his hand wrapped around his 7 inch dick, a fountain of precum leaking from the top, being used as lube. After 5 minutes of rapid stroking, suddenly Dan gave out a muffled moan and a spray of cum came gushing out and aimed into a tube that led through to the bathroom. <br />
*Probably set up to drain into the bath or something prevent the whole lounge filling up with cum,* Gavin guessed. His pants were pitching a tent from watching and he desperately wanted to experience what Dan was going through. <br />
*I totally should!* He thought, *Why not, he said the effects only last a day, with the weekend coming up I could try it out in my room and no one will even notice* <br />
Then Gavin quickly remembered what he already had planned. *Ah shit Myles was having a sleepover party with the guys friday and I really wanted to go,* Gavin grimaced, but then realized that’s the best time to try it out, with his mates. It was going to be parent free so no one would catch them. <br />
<br />
“Hey Gavin, I’m done in here and all cleaned up. Did you find some snacks?” Dan called out from the other room.<br />
At that point Gavin realized he should have been looking for food this whole time he was watching his uncle’s boyfriend masterbate. Panicking a bit, he started searching around the kitchen for something to bring back to the lounge with him, then spotted a capsule of pills on the bench.<br />
He realized this must be the growth pills Dan had used, so Gavin made a split second decision. <br />
“Ah actually, my mum just called, turns out she came back from work early and can pick me up now.” As he called out as he snuck over to his backpack and brought out his acne medication. <br />
“She’s coming over here?” Dan asked with quite a bit of concern in his voice.<br />
“Oh no, I told her I’d be waiting outside.” Gavin continued to lie as he swapped his pills for the pills in Dan’s capsule and placed the acne pill capsule, now with the stolen growth pills inside, into his pocket. Unaware that he had just condemned Dan to being in breach of his contract with the drug trial company. Possibly causing his current state to be a permanent one.<br />
“Anyway she’ll be here any minute now so I best head off.” The boy said as he started putting on his backpack.<br />
“Oh, yeah, fair enough. Good to have you around Gavin, but hey please make sure Andrew or your mum doesn’t know about this aye?” Dan said pointing to his massive pair of nuts as Gavin came around the corner to head to the front door.<br />
“Haha, don’t worry, my lips are sealed.” Gavin said smiling and waved goodbye as he left the house. As soon as he was out the door he started running home. *Man I can’t wait until friday!*<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
On Friday, after school Gavin and 4 of his best mates came back to their friend Myles’ place. With his parents away, they were free to do whatever they wanted the whole weekend. Gavin had been looking forward to this overnight party, even before getting these growth pills, as it was a great excuse to hang out with Myles, who he had a massive crush on, maybe even hook up with him if he is lucky.<br />
However, now with these pills, who knew what was going to happen, but it would certainly be hot and crazy in a fun way.<br />
<br />
Myles was the cutest guy in the school, most of the girls try to date him, but he clearly isn’t interested in them. Though Myles is definitely not shy about his looks either. He has an Instagram page full of selfies and shirtless pics, a page Gavin has masturbated to almost daily. On it were many pics of his super cute smile, but Gavin’s favorites were the ones focused around his mate’s V-line groin muscles that Gavin found irresistible.<br />
<br />
Neal and Jeffery were identical twins, so much so that even their best friends couldn’t tell them apart if they wore the same clothes and didn’t talk. There were rumours that they often experimented with each other, hand jobs and blow jobs, maybe even fucked. Gavin was definitely skeptical that they’ve gone that far, but the two weren’t shy about joking about twincest. They have even said to those that asked: “Of course we don’t care if we see each other naked, it’s just like looking in a mirror.”<br />
<br />
Gavin’s best friend Samuel was the oldest of the group, being 15, and also the chubbiest. He used to be the fittest of the group, but stopped playing sports a few months back and suddenly gained a lot of weight. Poor guy went from having nice pecs and abs to moobs and a belly.<br />
<br />
Phil was the skinniest of the group, but had the biggest dick by far. Gavin could often see the outline of the monster through Phil’s baggy shorts. Gavin estimated it was about 11 inches semi-hard, which Gavin assumed was impossibly large. Maybe if he takes some of the pills and his balls get too large for his pants, Gavin will finally see how big his dick actually is.<br />
<br />
The night was going pretty well, they hung out in Myles’ large living room playing video games and eating pizza most of the evening. Neal and Jeffrey had managed to get their older brother to score them some beer, so the group was slightly drunk. The two currently cuddled up together on the couch chatting away to Samuel about who should be dating Sarah. Phil was trying to make a cocktail the way he’s seen in the movies. While Gavin and a shirtless Myles sat close together playing Mario Kart. He had claimed he took it off because it was too hot inside, but Gavin suspected it was more to distract him from the game as that strategy was definitely working.<br />
<br />
By 10, Gavin thought it was time to bring out the pills and see what they did. <br />
<br />
“Hey guys, you won’t believe what I scored.”</p>
