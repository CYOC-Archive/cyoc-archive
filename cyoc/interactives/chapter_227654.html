<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well... I could become a lizard again, but I still want to use the Chronivac...&quot; Jake sighted, then selected the Lizard on the Chronivac menu and reassigned the name Zak, he wasn’t losing his best friend like this…<br />
<br />
Once he did this, the Chronivac loaded a previous profile, and he was given the option to get Zak back, with all his memories and everything. &quot;Wow... even if it never really happened, the Chronivac still has a backup for that…&quot; Jake confirmed the changes but he still had to do some adjustments.<br />
First he changed Zak’s species from *Lizard* to *Anthro-Lizard*. Apparently, this changed his age as well. &quot;I guess I should make him older if we really want to try all kind of things&quot; Jake thought, as he entered 22 years old. That seemed like a good age to enjoy our bodies, making him around 4&quot;5 feet tall, with Lime-colored scales and a 4 feet long tail.<br />
<br />
“I still want to feel small even if we’re going to become Anthros” Said Jeff as he also started changing himself as well, selecting *Anthro-Lizard* as the new species, his own height around 3&#39;9&quot; feet tall, with dark green  scales and his tail to also be 4&#39; feet long. Jake then changed his own age to 21, he wanted to be the younger... <br />
<br />
Then he clicked on the -RA Options- and changed the reality so Zak and himself became very good friends since they were kids, and now that they are adults they live together.<br />
<br />
Jake clicked on enter and rushed to the mirror, he loved the transformation process and he wouldn&#39;t miss this one.<br />
<br />
He noticed his alligator snout shortening and softening, becoming more of a lizard&#39;s. His large teeth shrinking as they merged with his gums. His eyes growing larger as the slit elongated into a thin line. “Oh yes! This is perfect!” Jeff said as his face changed, his voice changing a little, but loving the feeling of the dark green scales covering his muzzle.<br />
<br />
He watched his hands, the points of each finger swelling as small claws appeared on each digit, the scales that covered them specially designed for climbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so fucking awesome!&quot; Jake saw himself shrinking, now smaller and smaller. His alligator tail also changed, his scales softening as the whole appendage became more flexible.<br />
<br />
He was so focused on his transformation he didn&#39;t notice that his surroundings were also changing, the chairs now with an extra hole for a lizard&#39;s tail, the height of the desk decreasing as well… the doorknobs were now very close to the floor. It looked weird but also right, he wasn’t climbing just to open a door, that’d be stupid!<br />
<br />
“Whoa… I am so fucking small” As he looked down Jeff saw his feet changing the same way his hands did, his digits spreading apart, and dark green scales covered them as well. <br />
<br />
Finally, he started feeling kind of horny as his human dick started morphing into the Lizard&#39;s hemipenises, “Oh God… I think… it’s splitting!”  he grabbed it with his scaly hands and as he rubbed the meat it became softer. The skin now pinkish and then from top to bottom started splitting in half.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh yeah!&quot; Moaned Jake, as he noticed a tickle on his brain, his reality was being rewritten, he has always been a Lizard man, then with a final stroke on both diks, Jeff the lizard came all over the bedsheets.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the Backyard, the nameless lizard felt a tingling in his body, he looked left and right looking for whatever had done this to him. If it was a predator he needed to run.<br />
<br />
There was nothing weird nearby, but he was feeling strange, more aware... He raised his head and noticed he was taller, he raised his front legs and looked around but then he felt his hips cracking and he found a new balance on two legs, his tail happily swinging behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening to me...? Wait...&quot;. The Lizard just realized his brain was being affected now somehow, as a new knowledge and functions started developing as he aged through many years of experiences.<br />
<br />
His front legs were reshaping to be more useful. As the fingers scaled to let him have a better grip on things. His body kept growing and soon a naked Anthro Lizard of 4&#39;5&quot; feet was standing in the garden. It didn&#39;t take much time for Zak to enter his house, with every step he felt more confident about his body, as if he has always been this way, new memories forming, and soon he found Jake releasing his Lizard cum on the bedsheets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude what the actual fuck?! That’s my bed!&quot; Zak pretended to be angry as he charged towards him, loving the shameful look on Jake’s face before pushing him onto the bed. “Now you’re gonna lick it clean! Or else…” Zak threatened, waiting for his reaction. “Or what?” Answered Jake already noticing that Zak wasn’t being serious.<br />
<br />
“Oh I have a very good TAIL of what will happen next!” And before Jake could say anything about the horrible joke Zak Thrusted his tail into Jake’s cloaca, pushing hard as Jake moaned again, the base of his dicks were so fucking sensitive! No way he was losing this battle.<br />
<br />
Jake pushed him and found his way out, quickly swapping positions and now Zak was being held by Jake. “Oh so the little runt wants to pla-ugh!” Zak was interrupted as Jake thrusted his tail into Zak’s mouth and noticed the big swollen hemipenises on Zak’s cloaca.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just don’t know when to shut up sometimes&quot; Jake teased and grabbed one of the fucksticks as it throbbed, Zak could be muffled but still moaning at this, then Jake began working on them with his tongue, and to return the favor Zak also grabbed both of Jake hemipenises with his hands.<br />
<br />
They continued with this strange sixty-nine position for a while, the one they always end up doing when Jake wants to spice things up a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here I come!!&quot; Managed to say Zak as both fuckstiks released their load inside Jake&#39;s mouth. Jake also came again, covering Zak and himself in his Lizard Cum.<br />
<br />
This was a mess, the whole room reeked of Lizard Sex, and they were catching their breath after their fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what came over me today, but oh boy I liked it, and that doesn’t mean I’m cleaning this one, you started it&quot; Zak said, and Jake smiled, knowing that it was worth it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... There is something I want to show you&quot; Jeff said as he headed to the desk and started the Chronivac again.</p>
