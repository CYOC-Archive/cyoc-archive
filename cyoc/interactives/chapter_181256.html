<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After...that, Terry decided to go ahead with the pre-arranged study plan he had arranged, wherein he was due to go over to Drew&#39;s place for some assistance with his biology work. For more than one reason, Terry was unable to really grasp the recent turn toward microbiology, more to the point he didn&#39;t really grasp how to remember the various names for all the small scale steps phases and parts within the cells. He always got them mixed up - and he had been told that Drew was a pretty knowledgeable guy about it. So he went ahead with arranging a study session with Drew.<br />
<br />
But after what just happened between him and Brad, Terry found himself thinking back to his own experiences. The whole &quot;Terry did gay for pay&quot; thing was by and large rumors - but there WAS a kernel of truth to it. Everybody knew that Terry was one of the more attractive jocks, but he didn&#39;t exactly come from a house with stable income. So he needed some assistance to get things rolling with his football supplies. Shortly after his eighteenth birthday, when he needed a new jersey, he found a rather skeevy website that hosted &quot;cam shows&quot;.<br />
<br />
He found himself doing performances there of an increasingly lewd nature. Eventually, Terry was wearing a mask and pushing a dildo into his ass. The weirdest part of it was that Terry didn&#39;t wholly mind the more queer aspects of the shows. Sure he was mostly attracted to women, but knowing he drove men to such lustful states kind of...amplified the pleasure he got from his little shows. Maybe he wasn&#39;t wholly straight...<br />
<br />
...Well, that incident in there with Brad really did put that to another level.<br />
<br />
Terry at any rate didn&#39;t want the rumor to be revived with any degree of strength. So he hoped that Brad kept his mouth shut about it. Terry had no intention of dating, going out with, or fucking around with anyone who didn&#39;t have a vagina.<br />
<br />
But as Terry walked on over to Drew&#39;s place, he found himself wondering if something else might be going on. His shirt looked slightly tighter on him than usual, making Terry wonder if he might need to scale up his shirts...but then, he just got done at the gym. Maybe it was just a pump or something. Terry shivered as he flexed his quad in front of a window, watching the muscle tense and push out the front of his shorts noticeably.<br />
<br />
Fuck, if this was a pump, it was the best damn pump he ever felt. Terry grinned, and watched his reflection break out in the same cocky sneer. He didn&#39;t ever really indulge like this before. &quot;Heh, look at me...&quot; He shook his head and walked off - he did after all have some studying to do. He could flex later.<br />
<br />
Terry found himself thinking again of that incident with Brad.<br />
<br />
Fuck why was this cropping up so much in his mind? Terry remembered how good it felt smashing their rippling bodies together in the shower. How Brad&#39;s stocky, thick muscles contrasted against the powerfully built, hunky muscles Terry possessed. Maybe...maybe he was a little more complicated than he thought. Biting his lip to concentrate, Terry tried to get the images out of his head - just as well, the temptation to go back to his old habits in order to get some new shirts.<br />
<br />
He wondered if his old audience would be around now? And if they&#39;d still so eagerly give him some money just for him flexing and showing off his body. Maybe they&#39;d want him to bounce around on a dildo again and FUCK, there&#39;s his boner. Terry breathed and started to try to calm down - after all, he didn&#39;t want to show up to Drew&#39;s place sporting wood. It would give all those rumors some new life. And if he did go back to his old money making habit, maybe he could try and use a better mask next time.<br />
<br />
Keep himself clean at least publicly, and enjoy himself as soon as he was away from the public eye.<br />
<br />
By the time Terry showed up at Drew&#39;s place, he was sweating, feeling strange in his shirt and shorts both, and distinctly felt like his underwear was straining against his thigh and quadriceps. He swore, just his luck that all his clothes would feel like this just from a walk and a full body workout in the gym. Maybe he needed even more clothes than he thought. Or, he thought with a degree of mischief, he needed to start going commando.<br />
<br />
After a quick few knocks, Drew answered the door and Terry found himself briefly staring.<br />
<br />
The button up shirt and baggy jeans looked slightly tighter on Drew than usual, and something about his face looked a little more mature, more classically handsome than the boyish nerd he had came to school as. A more square jaw, a stronger look to him in general. His shoulders were noticeably broad even in his baggy clothes.<br />
<br />
Even as he watched Steve walk by in the background playing some game, Terry found himself admitting it looked like even the younger brother had started picking up some weights.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Terry,&quot; Drew started, looking at Terry&#39;s backpack slung across his shoulder. &quot;You got all your books ready? I&#39;ve prepared some note cards and stuff to make sure you&#39;re able to keep all the phases and compounds more readily.&quot; It seemed Drew was either blocking it from notice or just completely failed to notice anything.<br />
<br />
Terry nodded, &quot;Ready when you are, man.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Terry went inside to get ready for however much studying ended up happening. Though considering how much Terry was sweating, maybe he needed a quick dash into the shower - again. Fuck.</p>
