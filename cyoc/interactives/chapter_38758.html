<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lina could only watch in horror as Elizabeth was transformed into a candy girl. On another screen she watched as Geoffrey drank what the Master had given him, wondering what he was going to turn into. As soon as he drank the liquid it seemed like he was getting really hot. He wiped his brow and took off his shirt. Apparently that wasn't enough to cool him down as he quickly stripped out of the rest of his clothes. Once he was completely naked he sat down on the floor and that&quot;s when his transformation started. His hair changed to platinum blond and grew down to his waist. His face and body took on a more feminine appearance as breasts began to grow on his chest. They grew until they were about a DDD cup. At least that's the size Lina thought they were, it was difficult to tell from the monitor. She didn't see Geoffrey's final change into a girl but he soon got a surprised look on his face.<br />
<br />
     Lina had thought that Geoffrey's transformation was complete. She was proven wrong though as his legs fused together. As his legs fused together the skin on his legs were covered with what looked like golden bronze scales. Were Geoffrey's legs becoming a fish's tail? That was soon answered as his feet became classic mermaid fins. Geoffrey was now a mermaid and Lina could see the surprise on his face. She could tell that he started screaming something but the monitors weren't set up for sound.<br />
<br />
     On the other monitor the Master had raised his hand and the same blue light emitted from it. Elizabeth collapsed to the floor within seconds and the Master produced a metal gurney from someplace. The Master lifted Elizabeth onto the gurney with apparent difficulty. He then wheeled her to the room where Geoffrey was and did the same to him.<br />
<br />
     It was a couple minutes before the Master came back into the room bringing Elizabeth and Geoffrey with him. He placed Elizabeth on a table similar to the one Lina was on and placed Geoffrey into a water filled tank. As the Master passed Lina he said &quot;Your friend should be just as tasty as you I think. Unfortunately I'm too tired to do anything else today. I'll have to finish you tomorrow and start your friend. I'm sorry that you have to wait.&quot; The Master left and took Jess with him. Soon almost all the lights went out in the store.<br />
<br />
    Lina was glad that she had some more time to figure out a way to escape but couldn't see any. Geoffrey wouldn't be able to help because of his tail. Elizabeth was in the same situation as she was herself and Amy was chained to the wall. It seemed like it was a hopeless situation.<br />
<br />
    A few moments after the shop was locked up Lina heard Elizabeth ask &quot;Is that you Lina?&quot;<br />
<br />
     All Lina could do was slowly nod her head and mumble. Elizabeth nodded and jumped off the table. This surprised Lina as Elizabeth shouldn't have been able to move. She came over to her and said &quot;I can reverse the modifications that the Master did but I won't be able to return you to human for awhile yet. I'll explain once I'm finished returning you to a more normal form.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Elizabeth placed her hands on Lina and she immediately orgasmed. Slowly the alterations that the Master had made to her chocolate body reversed until Lina once again resembled herself. Lina was just about to ask Elizabeth what was going on when she felt her chocolate body firm up.<br />
<br />
     As soon as Lina could move again Elizabeth helped her up and said &quot;You must have some questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;You bet I do&quot; Lina said. &quot;How did you know that that man calls himself the Master? How were you able to reverse the changes he made to me just by placing your hands on me? Why can't you turn me human again? Can you help Amy and Geoffrey?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;To answer your last question first I will be able to&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;I guess that the Master had molded you with his hands. He didn't need to do that as he could have just placed his hands on you and will the changes to take place. He enjoys molding his candy girls and it helps him to visualize the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;It sounds like you know him&quot; Lina said interrupting Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well I've run into him before&quot; Elizabeth said. &quot;It was a long time ago and I had a different body which is why he didn't recognize me. If he had I would've had a bit of trouble staying conscious. His real name is Jason Argous. He has been changing innocent people since ancient Greek times. When he died he was sent to Tartarus. He has escaped several times and Zeus sends someone to send him back to Tartarus. This time it happens to be me.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;You mean that the Master is Greek and the Greek gods exist?&quot; Lina asked hardly believing what Elizabeth just said.<br />
<br />
     &quot;It's true. Both Zeus and Hades are beside themselves with anger. Jason has escaped so many times that it's grown apparent that someone is helping him.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Well why didn't you send him back when you saw him?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;I needed to know how many people he had transformed. It doesn't look like he's changed that many people yet. That's good since I won't have to change many people back. Though that means he's still pretty strong despite being tired. That could be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;I'll help you and I know that Amy will help too. We just need to unchain her and wake her up.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Lina started to move toward Amy but Elizabeth grabbed her arm and hissed &quot;Don't be stupid. Do you even know what she has been transformed into?&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;Of course I do&quot; Lina said with a defensive note in her voice. &quot;She's a cow now.&quot;<br />
<br />
      &quot;She isn't a cow. She is a minotaur now. One crazy looking minotaur but a minotaur all the same. If we wake her up it won't be Amy that wakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Lina knew that the Minotaur was a brutal bloodthirsty beast in Greek myths. If Amy was one now then it would be far safer leaving her chained and asleep until Elizabeth could change her back. &quot;Why can't you change Amy back now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Because Jason has to be back in Tartarus before my will can overcome his.&quot;<br />
<br />
     &quot;So what are you going to do?&quot;</p>
