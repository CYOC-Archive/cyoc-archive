<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he passed a window, he watched as lightning flickered across the sky. Shortly after he heard thunder as it crashed overhead. Wondering if the storm was passing, Johnathan, who wasn&#39;t too sure where exactly he would find candles in such a creepy old place, glanced out the window and watched as the rain, instead of letting up, began to fall harder. Shivering, not only because of how damp he was from being caught out in the weather, the fifteen year old turned away from the window. Wondering how the others were getting on, he continued to creep down the hall.<br />
<br />
His thoughts on what they agreed to look for, he whispered, &quot;Be glad to get out here when we can,&quot; he tried a door as he passed it and found himself looking at another corridor that seemed to stretch on for some time. Stepping into it, thinking that if he was orientating himself correctly, he was headed toward the back of the house, he figured the kitchen would probably be the best place to look for candles.<br />
<br />
Behind him, the door quietly closed, but Johnathan was too busy staring at the walls to notice this, or the fact that it disappeared and was replaced by more hall. His attention on the paintings, the teenage boy thought the black and white pictures were often creepy, as they showed dour faced children and adults in outdated clothing. Wondering who these people were, toying with the idea that they were some of the original occupants, &quot;Or some relation to the owners,&quot; he mused aloud, he listened as, faintly, he heard thunder as he continued to study the portraits that dotted the walls. Reaching the end of the corridor, he found that it dead-ended in a rather ornate door and twisting the handle, he pushed it open.<br />
<br />
Rich, earthy and with the barest him of decay, a smell wafted out and Jonathan breathed it in. Thinking he must have found a back garden, he didn&#39;t really relish the idea of going out and getting wet. Peering out the door, he noted that everything appeared dry and stepping out, he gazed upward. Lightning flicking across the sky and he could see high above a glass and metal ceiling. Thinking it had to be about five to seven stories or so above, he stared for a moment longer, counting until the thunder came. Figuring that the storm wasn&#39;t going to let up any time soon, he turned to go back the way he came.<br />
<br />
Only to find the door he had just come through was gone. Staring at the brick wall, Jonathan muttered, &quot;What the shit is going on,&quot; as he reached out and touched the wall. Feeling only aged brick, he considered the possibility that he had somehow walked a couple feet to either his left or right whilst he&#39;d been gazing up and looking in either direction, he could only see brick wall.<br />
<br />
Troubled by this, certain there should be a door, he turned away, counted to ten and turned back. Still not seeing the door, he groaned and whispered, &quot;What the fuck,&quot; before turning his attention to the garden.<br />
<br />
Dimly, he could make out a stone path before him, whilst off to his right he thought someone had set up a patio chair and table that were made of metal. On either side of the path, plants grew wild and stepping closer, Johnathan noted the path gave way to earth, which he figured would make sense. Thinking that everything needed a gardener or something, he absently began following the path, thinking that it he did, it would eventually loop back to the house and, hopefully, a door out. Passing through a metal gate that was attached to a brick wall, the teenage boy soon found himself coming toward a fork in the path and stopping, he peered first to his left, then toward his right.<br />
<br />
To his left, off in the distance, he could faintly make out a free-standing structure that looked like it was a giant metal dome placed atop seven pillars. Seeing no point to it, he turned his attention to the other direction and noted that it headed toward a huge marble fountain and curved around it. Figuring this was his best bet, he turned to the right and started toward the fountain. Approaching it, passing a number of stone benches as he did, Jonathan stopped upon reaching the fountain. Staring at it, he found himself curious as to whether, at one time, it had ever run and it it had ever had any decorations.<br />
<br />
His footfalls not making any sound, he stepped closer and gazed upward to the flat surface in the middle of it. Thinking that surely, at some point, a state probably stood up there, he huffed in agitation that he&#39;d gotten distracted. Walking around the fountain, he noted that the path continued onward, deeper into the garden. Turning toward where he guessed the house was, he groaned and thought that he was moving away from the house. Looking back at the fountain, he peered in and noted it was full of water, then took a step back as he realised that the water didn&#39;t appear stagnant, but had a fresh look to, like it had piped in only moments ago. Peering upward, he found he could see no workings on and glancing at the water, he muttered, &quot;That&#39;s just weird on so many levels,&quot; as he considered how everything else around him had either gone wild without care, looked unused, like the fountain, but the water in the basin appeared fresh.<br />
<br />
Unable to explain this, he turned away from the fountain and gazed at the garden. Smelling the various plants in bloom, he considered his options. On one hand, he figured he could continue on the path and hope that it did take him back. Yet, on the other hand, he figured that if he knew where the house was, and a door back into it, he could maybe make a shorter trip by cutting through the garden itself. Glancing back at the fountain, he noted a series of stones placed in it and mentally calculated that he could climb up onto the flat surface, which he figured was about two stories about him. Weighing his options, trying to think if maybe he missed something, Johnathan eventually decided on what to do.</p>
