<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Receiving the redhead’s masculinity, against her will!<br />
<br />
“Two. One. Initiate.”<br />
<br />
You felt a surge of energy as the process began. A powerful presence grew within you, fueled by the machine’s stimulation of your mind and body. It rose and rose as the machine whirled and vibrated around you. The energy spiked and you felt a quaking within you, as though some long-closed cave had just cracked open to the sun after millennia of silent darkness. You felt raw, exposed, and if these tubes, wires, and connections to the capsule were the machine’s arms, you were putty, ready for molding.<br />
<br />
Before long, the power and pleasure leveled off. You squirmed in your restraints, but it was a pleasant sensation — a low-frequency sway more akin to something you would experience at an EDM festival, rather than the uncontrollable spasms of orgasm. You looked across at the redhead. She bit her lip, eyes closed, head thrown back in the throes of pleasure. As she regained control with the plateau, her body began to sway in an imperfect mirror of yours.<br />
<br />
“We have a good initation. Beginning sequence.”<br />
<br />
You met eyes with the redhead. Again, that devilish look. This time with a sense of expectation. You felt the energy building within the machine once again, and the look on her face confirmed your suspicions: she meant to extract your masculinity and add it to her own!<br />
<br />
One moment of sheer panic — you felt your face fell, you could see her reaction, the corners of her mouth curling, her lips parting in a silent laugh. Could you signal the technician? Halt the process? Your head was secured. It was too late.<br />
<br />
The machine released a powerful wave of vibration, and you realized you weren’t feeling the direct effects — the thrum came as a sympathetic vibration to your counterpart — it was in fact her chamber which was being activated.<br />
<br />
In an instant, the expression on her face changed. She mouthed silent words, easy to see through the facemark: “No, no, no.” You felt a sense of calm wash over you as a second thrum reverberated through her body, and her body arched with pleasure. You could see her cock twitch and jerk in its sleeve.<br />
<br />
Her capsule thrummed again and she threw her head back, her hair whipping around uncontrollably. Her body was twitching, and though her mouth was open, there were no words — just soundless gasps. Pleasure? Pain? Her head thrashed forward again, and you could see an almost reluctant smile between obvious gasps for air. Pleasure then.<br />
<br />
The thrums were coming faster now, coaxing a new arch from her back each time — first emphasizing her tits with hardened nipples, then her ass, then casting her cock into sharp relief against a light mounted on the opposite wall. Her balls were tight against her body. She was clearly reaching a peak.<br />
<br />
“Extraction.”<br />
<br />
Her body jerked in the unmistakable pattern of orgasm. Her cock leapt hard against its bounds, her stomach tensed, and now you could hear her cries of pleasure through the layers of plastic and glass separating you.<br />
<br />
Her cock jerked and spasmed, but no semen emerged. Instead, a golden liquid began to ooze from the tip, thick as molasses. It wasn’t urine, either — it glowed, almost as bright as any other light you had seen in the room. You looked up and saw a similar liquid emerging from each of her nipples, the cups on her breasts clearly providing suction. But that paled in comparison to what was happening around her head. From her mouth emerged a golden mist which was carried away by the face piece, and wisps of smoke appeared to be emanating from her head, floating near her for just a moment before being swept into one of the tubes connected to the helmet, stretching out in fractal patterns as it ascended into the machinery above the capsule.<br />
<br />
You watched her body jerk, the translucent tubes turning into lines of golden light. It was strangely mesmerizing, and you lost yourself in the light, body still swaying from side to side with the gentle pleasure still vibrating through you. You became aware of a hunger inside — whatever was being exposed by this machine was ready to receive what was coming.<br />
<br />
And then, as you somehow knew you would, you saw the golden light entering your chamber. You looked down and saw a thin strip of light moving up the tube towards your own throbbing cock, saw similar lights moving toward your chest, and somehow felt a glow in your mind — perhaps the helmet? You looked up and could see that something seemed to be coming down through that connection as well — the fractal patterns were so beautiful…<br />
<br />
You blinked and looked forward. The golden lights were converging, clearly synchronized towards hitting your body simultaneously. You didn’t know where to look… and somehow you knew it wouldn’t matter.<br />
<br />
“Connection.”<br />
<br />
The golden light didn’t just hit your body, it entered you, passed through skin and bone and flowed directly into a core you didn’t know you had. The pleasure was a high torque engine, revving slowly but persistently, driving you wild. You felt your perception shift, and felt the redhead there with you. Were your eyes open? Closed? It didn’t matter. You could see her and feel her just as well as you could yourself, and while you were still a separate being, the intimacy was nearly submerging.<br />
<br />
In that moment, you could feel her thoughts, and knew the extent of her attempted betrayal. She hadn’t lied: there were two very strong-willed beings within her. But rather than allow one to dominate, she sought to maximize them both. A memory, not your own, came to your mind unbidden: she had done this before, but with a woman — stealing her femininity by tricking her. She pegged you as gullible and insecure. She wasn’t wrong, you were forced to admit herself. But this time, she wouldn’t be successful. <br />
<br />
And she would pay.<br />
<br />
The thought came with a red hot anger that flared within you, almost brighter than the golden light connecting you both. You felt her essence shy away from you, but it was too late. The connection had been established.<br />
<br />
The next step was clear.<br />
<br />
“Transfer.”<br />
<br />
The word came with an accompanying THRUM, and this time you felt every joule of that power vibrating through your body, your exposed spirit. The red anger shifted and dispersed, flowing into the golden light and changing it. Was it pollution? Or an admixture of righteous hellfire, summoned to exact vengeance for a failed confidence trick. It was pleasurable, oh yes, and clearly it was supposed to be uncontrollable. At least, you could see the redhead’s body jolt from side to side. But for you, the pleasure was contained, encased, complete without being overwhelming, intense without power.<br />
<br />
At the edge of your awareness, you felt, more than saw, one technician turn to another. A furrowed brow. An anxious word.<br />
<br />
The machine THRUMed again, and the changes began. You saw her throat smooth, felt your voice change, your subconscious moans gaining a smoky, smooth undertone. Her cries of pleasure increased in pitch — a major fifth? It didn’t matter — whatever trace of her male speaking pattern was gone.<br />
<br />
THRUM. Your shoulders and pectoral muscles thickened as you saw the redhead’s shoulders round and her tits gain a softness that had not been there before. The energy flowed to your hands. They were still encased, but you found you could test your grip. You found it satisfying. The redhead’s fingers softened, her fingers gaining in delicate sensitivity what they lost in power.<br />
<br />
THRUM. Your thighs thickened, new steel cables running from your pelvis to your feet. Your ass bulged with the confident mass of a man equipped for a long day’s labor. At the same time, the angle of the redhead’s hips eased to a gentle curve.<br />
<br />
THRUM. You felt your abdominal girdle tighten, spiderwebs of strength connecting your core to your extremities. The feeling caused you to arch your own back and close your eyes.<br />
<br />
THRUM. Your calves and feet thickened, arched, strengthen to match the demands of the rest of your body.<br />
<br />
THRUM. Your cock jerked suddenly — your awareness focused on the beating of your heart, each pump of blood seemingly going directly to your groin. You felt your hardness pulse, larger and larger You opened your eyes and looked down at your expanding genitals. Each wave of pleasure visibly traveled from your cocked down your shaft to your pelvis, up your stomach into your chest to be circulated throughout your body.<br />
<br />
You looked across at the redhead — her once proud cock was clearly shrinking, and while the process was clearly pleasurable for her, you could feel her regret — harsh and spiked at first, before melting to something soft.<br />
<br />
THRUM. Your cock was still vibrating, but this wave was focused inside you, at right angles to reality. Your mind was twisting, absorbing her masculine thoughts and memories, absorbing her desires. The desire to take, to control, to grab and pull and drain. The memories of conquests over time, early experiments with domination, gender twisting scenarios of violation and trespass. Her own twisted masculinity mixed with your anger at her betrayal and you felt the energy multiply, growing inside you seemingly unboundedly.<br />
<br />
THRUM. Your entire body surged and stretched, and you felt yourself push against the restraints in a new way. No longer comfortable, they felt newly tight and restrictive.<br />
<br />
THRUM. The energy was building to a climax. Your eyes fixated on what was left of the redhead’s cock — just a small nub, her pathetic, tiny balls nearly absorbed into her body.<br />
<br />
A voice in your head, unbidden: “Yes. Give it to me.”<br />
<br />
THRUM. There was a scream of pleasure from the redhead, and a growl erupted from your own throat. The orgasm was different than any other you had ever experienced — while it still came in waves, they were strangely inverted. Rather than an explosion outward, the pulses drew inward, only increasing your energy. The redhead was clearly having the opposite experience, each wave wreaking havoc on her body as you simply absorbed what was left of her energy. Your balls felt heavier with each wave, your arms and legs more powerful. You saw her penis disappear, a thin slit forming between her legs as the skin surrounding it puffed and swelled. Her extraction was complete.<br />
<br />
You closed your eyes and allowed your mind to fog over with pleasure.<br />
<br />
Time passed. Was it seconds? Minutes? Hours? It was luxurious.<br />
<br />
Dimly, somewhere in the back of your mind, you heard an alarm bell.<br />
<br />
The restraints were digging into your biceps.<br />
<br />
How annoying.<br />
<br />
Summoning yourself back from wherever you had gone, you flexed your arms and legs. You felt a sense of release, and opened your eyes.<br />
<br />
The room was different. It took you a moment to realize that the cool medical lighting had been replaced with flashing red emergency signals — your perspective was different. You had been of average height, but now you towered over the redhead across from you, who sagged in her harness, clearly exhausted from the effort. Strange: you felt awake and alive. Ready.<br />
<br />
Juices oozed from between her legs down to a puddle at her feet.<br />
<br />
You turned to face the room proper. The technicians stood frozen, staring at you. They looked small, their faces masks of anxiety. Something had clearly gone wrong — some sort of reaction between her essence and yours, some kind of cascade scenario, who knows.<br />
<br />
Your mind worked fast. They would want to fix their mistake You couldn’t let that happen.<br />
<br />
You stepped out of what remained of the restraints. One of the technicians seemed to engage their mind and reached for a button on their console, but you were too quick. One large stride to the door, a brief exertion to slide it open — you heard a wrenching of metal, but it barely registered.<br />
<br />
You stood on the top step, looking down at the technicians. Simple men, and fertile women. Delicious. And the redhead was still bound for you. She needed to pay for her bad intentions.<br />
<br />
Your newly enhanced cock was still hard.<br />
<br />
It was time for some fun.</p>
