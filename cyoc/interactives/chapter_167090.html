<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“No…I am afraid not, the news will report them lost in a horrible drowning accident.” Stated Cura as she touched her bag, in there where the orbs which could transform the humans before her. “Same for you all whom choices to join them…so what say you?”<br />
The five humans just looked at the mermaid before her wondering what to say and what to think. There friends somewhere basically family where now merfolk if this was true and if they said no then they would never see them again. Still if they said yes, they would be with their friends however they would be leaving their lives behind, their other friends and family, their careers and the like. <br />
“I’ll do it.” Said Adrian while the others where still thinking it over. <br />
“You realize you will be giving up your life on land and…” started Cura as Adrian raised his hand to silence her. <br />
“I am a homeless uber driver whose car is on the edge of crapping out.” stated Adrian “My parents are dead and my only sister is a drug addict shooting her life into her veins and will not let me help her. I will either end up hungry and homeless or worse on drugs or drinking myself to death. Might as well find out what is happening under the sea.”<br />
“Very well.” Said Cura as she reached into her bag and pulled out a golden orb of swirling energy contained in what looked to be glass. <br />
“Please stand back.” Ordered Cura to everyone else as they swam back a bit but their eyes locked on Cura and Adrian. “This will not hurt but will feel weird.”<br />
“Whatever it is I have dealt with worse.” Stated Adrian as Cura nodded her head and placed the orb on his chest and then with one quick movement she crushed the orb. The energy shot outwards a bit but most shot right into Adrian’s body. She then kicked away and waited. <br />
Adrian for his part did flinch a bit when the orb was broken but that because he expected pain. None came and he calmed down. He looked at his arms and chest and for a while noticed nothing happening.<br />
“Your legs!” yelled Colton as Adrian looked down towards his legs. He had expected some changes up top first but rethinking it that was a mistake. His swim trunks, a cheap $10 swimsuit which he had gotten because it was easier to get clean by taking a quick swim in the ocean then going to the public beach showers. Basically, he gotten the suit because it let him do a quick bath and remain semi-clean. His suit seamed cleaner now and tighter as if it was merged with his skin. Then he noticed that the cheap fabric had been changed into scales. He reached down and touched it and they felt like scales and he could feel his fingers brush against the scales. <br />
It wasn’t painful at all but it did feel weird as the rich brown swimsuit changed to scales and began to move downward. The only semi-painful part was when the scales reached his knees, they snapped together and there was a slight pain as he figured his bones merging together. Finally it reached his legs and swallowed it up as well. His legs also extended a bit by at least a foot or a foot and a half, as two fins with semi-see through skin. He looked on not panicking in any way as he felt a dull pain on his sides. He reached to his sides and felt slits, his new gills.<br />
“Well that was weird but fine.” Said Adrian as he looked at his tail, yes it was brown but not a solid brown it was mostly a chocolate color but there was darker shades of brown near the end of the tail while tanner around his waist. <br />
“Welcome to merman hood.” Said Cura <br />
“Wow…” said Lupa as she touched his tail. “It is real…I thought I was just imagining it.”<br />
“It is very real.” Said Cura with a laugh. “So does anyone else wishes to join him and your other friends?”<br />
Everyone else was still considering the offer when Stacy swam forward up to Cura.<br />
“I am not going to lose Chloe…but help me if you are lying to me about her I will do everything I can to hurt you.” Threatened Stacy as Cura chuckled a bit. <br />
“You are a lot like Chloe…I can see why you two love each other so much.” Stated Cura as she pulled another orb and placed her hand on Stacy’s chest above her breasts. Taking a hint everyone stepped or in Adrian’s case swam back as Cura broke the orb. <br />
The process was much the same, only it started with her bikini top, it seamed to phase out for a moment as the material moved around. The straps turned into fishing line or sea weed while the fabric over her breasts turned into hardened see shells, a black sea shell like her suit. Her bikini bottom turned into scales and began to march downward, the black scales shinning a bit in the sunlight which came down from the surface as her tail formed. Unlike Adrian’s her tail went to her knees and stopped, for a moment she was confused before she noticed her ankles had joined together and a matching set of scales was working it’s way up. It took only a few moments, but it was done, she floated there a black scaled mermaid, her new gills opening up just below and to the side of her beasts. <br />
“Wow…” said Stacy in amazement as she couldn’t help herself but do a few twists and spins in the water.<br />
“So does our suit become our tails?” inquired Harmony<br />
“It normally does when it is a human being transformed like this or by a merchild, if you want random, they you would have to go nude.” Explained Cura as she looked at Adrian and Stacy “Sorry I should have said that sooner.”<br />
“Don’t worry, Black is my favorite color, I have always been a little goth.” Stated Stacy as Adrian just shrugged. <br />
“So we have a new mermaid and a new merman, what about you three?” inquired Cura</p>
