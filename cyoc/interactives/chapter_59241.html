<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Confused, but knowing what's just happened to you, you put the note in your pocket and <br />
decide to try to figure things out later. When the school day ends you are desperate to get <br />
home and can't wait to get on the bus even though you're usually embarrassed to take the <br />
bus. While on the bus you sit by yourself and look out the window trying to figure out what <br />
has happened to you. The note, however, has other ideas and slips out of your pocket <br />
without you noticing it. After you get off at your stop, a man takes your seat and picks up <br />
the note. He is going to throw it aside but something makes him open it. He reads the first <br />
line:<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl, would your handwriting be nice?<br />
The man looks quizzically at the note and goes to throw it away but he feels an awful sense <br />
of worry that something bad will happen, so instead he sighs and pulls out a biro from his <br />
pocket. He writes, &quot;I suppose so, probably pretty girly with little hearts and so on&quot;<br />
Question 2:<br />
If you were a girl... would you like pink?<br />
&quot;Don't all girls? Yes I would love pink.&quot; not noticing that the pen had changed to pink and <br />
so had his t-shirt. His writing had also changed to a more flowery, girly style without him <br />
noticing.<br />
Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
You think for a second and write, &quot;soft, long and wavy&quot;. You don't notice your hair flow out <br />
to the side, just longer than shoulder length, with soft undulating waves.<br />
Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?<br />
Red you say and your pants turn to red jeans.<br />
Question 5: If you were a girl.... what would your hair color be?<br />
Strawberry blonde<br />
Question 6: If you were a girl... what would your eye color be?<br />
Blue<br />
Question 7: If you were a girl.... would you like makeup?<br />
Yes and I'd like bright red dark lipstick. Your lips became painted dark red.<br />
Question 8: If you were a girl.... would you be sporty?<br />
Not sporty as such but I'd go to the gym often.<br />
Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?<br />
Not really, I don't like them, I'd probably wear pink princess chucks. Which is exactly what <br />
you are now wearing.<br />
Question 10: If you were a girl.... would you wear a skirt?<br />
Sometimes but mostly jeans<br />
Question 11: If you were a girl.... would you wear jewellery?<br />
Yes, I'd have hoop earrings, plastic bracelets, a tiny diamond nose piercing and a belly <br />
button piercing.<br />
<br />
At that point the piercings appeared you notice something was going on but other than <br />
you thinking that your hair needs a cut you can't place it exactly.<br />
After all, you love your piercings and your oversized hoop earrings.<br />
<br />
Question 12: If you were a girl.... what size would your breasts be?<br />
<br />
LOL you think. This is a really amusing game. You think for a second and realize that you <br />
probably wouldn't want to be too too big like a playboy model and you think of the girls <br />
you like, so you write down B cup.<br />
<br />
At that point your breasts sprout from little buds behind your nipples and your aureola <br />
expand along with your nipples into a B cup. You are so surprised you gasp. Suddenly you <br />
realize this isn't a game and go to tear the note up, but your eyes are dragged to the note.<br />
<br />
It says, &quot;You MUST finish the note or else you will get stuck like this forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shit you think. I wonder what sort of deranged genie or whatever is doing this. I suppose <br />
I'm in it till I get home at least then I can figure out what to do.<br />
<br />
Question 13: If you were a girl, would you be into guys?<br />
You think for a second about this being hypothetical because of course this isn't going to <br />
really be permanent and it's obviously just a daydream anyway so you write, &quot;I'd like guys <br />
and girls but I suppose I'd mainly be into guys because I'd probably want babies at some <br />
point, but I'd probably be a slut I think no matter what the gender of my partners.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 14: If you were a girl, would you shave?<br />
No, I'd have had depilation treatment done. At that point all the hair on your body except <br />
on your head disappears.<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl, would you use pads or tampons?<br />
Not having any idea, you'd say, &quot;both because I've still not decided yet.&quot;<br />
At that point your junk contracts and softly disappears and is replaced by a vagina, lips and <br />
clitoris. But you don't notice this. There is a slightly popping feeling and your testes, which <br />
have retracted into your stomach, disappear and are replaced by fully functioning ovaries. <br />
<br />
Question 16: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
That's easy. I'd be wearing a pink hello kitty t-shirt. Which is exactly what you are wearing.<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you were a girl, would you be wearing briegs, bikini, thong or boxers?<br />
&quot;Being as I would be a slut, of course I'd be wearing a thong.&quot; Which you are.<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and <br />
ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
Well if you were a *girl* you think, you'd probably be at college or college material so you <br />
put eight. You notice no difference because you are already pretty smart, though your <br />
natural ADD disappears without you noticing.<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a girl, what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
Probably a sports bra, but I'd have a lace bra in my gym bag because I'd be going to the <br />
gym. And there was a pink gym bag with your gym clothes in it along with a lace white bra <br />
at your side on the bus-seat. Your b-cup is held gently but firmly by a nice comfortable <br />
sports bra.<br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl, how old would you be, how tall would you be without <br />
shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?<br />
I'd be 5'5'', I'd be 19 years old and a freshman at college and I'd weight 110 lbs.<br />
Immediately your bones pop and contract and reform and your bulk seems to swallow itself <br />
up as your shape contorts to match what you wrote. <br />
<br />
Last Question: If you were a girl, what would your name be?<br />
That's easy you think, I've always loved the name &quot;Dana&quot; so you write &quot;Dana&quot;.<br />
All of a sudden you realize you have been daydreaming and you look up.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; you realize, &quot;this is my stop&quot; and instead of your usual stop you get off at the <br />
University Station because you're going to the University Gym. You leave the note, not <br />
thinking about it, and get off the bus, your memories have been completely replaced, not <br />
having remembered that you ever were a middle aged man. As you get off the bus you <br />
catch the eye of a cute guy watching you and smile but don't look back. <br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later you emerge from the gym, a slim, hot looking chick and you walk <br />
down the center aisle of the gym towards the equipment, very aware of the eyes of all the <br />
guys on you as well as some of the girls. You stick your breasts out, flick your hair and <br />
smile secretly to yourself, loving the face that your star is in the ascendant.</p>
