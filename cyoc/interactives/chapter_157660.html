<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">as it was raining that The next moment before he could decide to think about anything any further, he was suddenly in darkness. It wasn&#39;t black for him to see exactly where he was, but it was close enough as He stood perfectly still. he soon realized he wasn&#39;t really standing, but He couldn&#39;t see anything nearby that would tell him what he was really when he started feeling a tingling sensation across his whole body for Jeff knew right away his changes were about to start on becoming a Koblod.<br />
<br />
His body twisted and turned, almost like it was on fire with each breath that he then felt a strong surge of testosterone level as his body began to swell up while growing out massively in every direction. His muscles didn&#39;t exploded as much for it was mostly in the areas of his abs, pecs, etc. his body became so much more muscular is when he felt like his body was becoming so thick and hard right now for it was about what he would expect it to be in about five years on working out hard core while his clothes were beginning to rip because of his massive growth, disintegrated to shreds as they fell off his changing body from his shirt and socks that this left him nearly half naked and almost impossibly bulky.<br />
<br />
There was a exhilarating feeling as he felt his shoulders becoming more broaden that Jeff could somehow feel just how strong he was for his build had changed completely while at the same time, he seemed to be getting more mature. his skin on his body at the time grew a bit of hair all over for it even got thicker, but gotten thinner around his manhood as it inflated and got bigger that it grew while his facial features were shifting and changing. it was Actually more than what it seemed as He wasn&#39;t just rapidly growing body hairs, but actual thick, shaggy, coat of fur of a that was grey.<br />
<br />
unlike the rest of him, His dick mostly stayed the same as his balls swelled up to the size that were a little bigger than most humans while brightened to a lighter shade to match the rest of his newly coat of fur. lifting a hand up over his face is when his fingers at the end of Jeff&#39;s muscular arms were tipped with sharp black claw like nails that his once normal human hands vanished as this also happened to his feet, instead of drastically being reformed to canine like pawed legs for his feet. turning over to his stomach, he felt something pushed out from the base of his spine as he turned to look at a tufted grey tail that he was actually wagging it while it was growing to its full length.<br />
<br />
The last touches of the transformation was Finally starting to kick in as Jeff&#39;s face, his entire head was what changed the most of him for His nostrils flared that even his nose and mouth began to push out into a canine muzzle. His teeth started and grew out sharper while changing into carnivorous points as they weren&#39;t the only thing going on that The scents were overwhelming him, but his canine snout began sorting out the myriad of the scents he was now experiencing. His dull brown hair grew out more, but not to become the same shaggy grey fur which covered the rest of him for it slowly turned grey itself and spread down his face as His skull changed shape for it was Then things felt like they paused for a split second that It was only a moment when Jeff realized the world had been utterly silent up to this point.<br />
<br />
to this moment for his human type ears were growing pointer as they travailed up to the top of his furry head now that soon enough, his hearing started up again for he could somehow hear the sounds of rats scurrying under the floorboards quietly in the night air outside. with his new ears flicking this way and that away while testing them out, His eyes color swiftly changed to become amber. He had lost sense of time while thinking of what he would be wearing in this world as It was hard to tell in the very dim light, but something told him by now that he was still basically male.<br />
<br />
to travel around in this new world he was in without any of the needs was down right dangerous that when it was all over was when Jeff took this chance to finally get to look and examine himself over while admiring his huge new body as he jumped up to his feet that he was now standing. With the changes seeming to be done that Jeff took a moment to found himself standing a bit taller as he sniffed around a bit, then stared back at his hairry limbs for His body was completely covered in fur now. when He saw a glimpse of his tail wagging that he sillingly tried to catch it while going around in circle for 3 times, acting like he was just a playful puppy he normally played with.<br />
<br />
once caught, he quickly let it go for it was in his mouth for some reason when a creeping sense of confusion swept him as he had no idea why he just did it in the first place that he then refocused on how good he felt while feeling just how massive, powerful, strong, and incredibly manly he now was. he could see, hear, even smell much more better all around him that He began to think just how good this could be somehow, yet his human intelligence, Memories, education, emotion, and more as The human boy was still in there while in a glimmer of his conscience for he was still in full control with a powerful, brute body. a feral desire instinct that was fierce and brutal awakened as a sudden animal rage overwhelmed him to let out a dog&#39;s bellow.<br />
<br />
Where once stood a teenage human boy just a few minutes ago was nothing more now then a fully-grown huge kobold wolf. Jeff was somewhere in the middle of the morning area now, like the place was pretty self sustaining for He had newer memories that were easy to call up of recalling a large man and a human girl with both yellow cat ears and tail to match her short yellowish blond hair as They had gone on several quests together while also with a good understanding of things. had He set the Chronovac to a full year for this!?<br />
<br />
Jeff was about to jump out of bed and stomp in frustration when it wasn&#39;t long after that he first heard voices outside. &quot;Does this seem like a good spot?&quot; came a young womans voice.<br />
<br />
There was a pause, and then a sigh came up. &quot;I think so. We can shelter in here until the storm passes.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were soon the sounds of gear being dropped to the ground. His eyes soon adjusted to the light as he then remembered that in his mind who they were, and where he was. thinking it might be done when the time expired for it did had a time limit, or if the Chronivac were to be damaged that even if he home with both sis and boss, Was this the best of all possible worlds he was in, or was it the worst world to be in?<br />
<br />
these, and other questions were soon answered from his newly found memories when he called them up as then knew why he was doing there. he soon remembered what he was going to do and where he was going to next. what was he going to do now?</p>
