<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Christmas parties were almost always big, as businesses looked to celebrate another successful year, or at least some measure of doing something that people would like. Some individuals would throw Christmas parties for friends and family. Many of these parties, particularly for businesses often came before Christmas Eve or Christmas Day itself, often because of how the holiday often went, and if they were open on Christmas Eve, the hours they were open for was less than normal, and Meat Market was one of those that often did this. It was something that was a part of Lyre and Animalia&#39;s Christmas every year.<br />
<br />
This year, however, brought about new challenges for those that ran the club, and for Miss Fabina the main challenge came from three now familiar people, Trixie, Dixie, and Vixie. The three bimbos that had come in to convert and get jobs at the Meat Market had retained some measure of steady attendance with the program that Fabina had required them to attend to earn a GED if they wanted to work at the Meat Market in any way, and that was good. But because the program was ultimately part of the terms of employment, Miss Fabina also got updates on the grades that the three earned, and while they weren&#39;t outright failing, neither were they truly good. Which wasn&#39;t so good, particularly when adding in how Trixie had been able to arrange a &quot;porn shoot&quot; with a Wolf Animalian from the BARA House. Miss Fabina still wasn&#39;t sure on how she managed it. A part of her wondered if there was money involved in it.<br />
<br />
But the success of that, and the fact that it soon went across various other adult sites online and gained some attention, Miss Fabina found herself in a position where some of the Meat Market&#39;s human clientele were more interested in seeing more of Trixie, Dixie, and Vixie which clashed a lot with what she&#39;d wanted to do. It meant that the three of them were put on the schedule and would have one appearance every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the evening, and the only thing that Miss Fabina had managed was that on the other days the three were to come in and discuss their success with their GED studies, largely in the hopes of gaining progress, which she had to admit was being made, even if only slowly. But that didn&#39;t mean that the three bimbos couldn&#39;t pose a distraction, even at the Meat Market&#39;s Christmas party.<br />
<br />
This distraction started with Vixie dancing there and moving up to alone man that at a stool and taller table viewing the main stage, where a different routine was also going on. Vixie, like the rest of the Meat Market&#39;s staff was dressed as a &quot;sexy elf&quot; as she grinded her butt against the man and tried to wrap her tail around the man&#39;s neck. The size fit and had all the red and green coloration that fit the Christmas vibe that was set up for the party, and Miss Fabina was thankful that Vixie and the other bimbos hadn&#39;t done anything too lewd for the party. As the parties for certain holidays, particularly Christmas and Easter, which were both of a religious origin, were designed to not have actual nudity for the party. Risque would work, but outright nudity not so much... not on Christmas.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe that is enough Vixie,&quot; Miss Fabina spoke as she approached and tried to position herself so that the view of the stage wasn&#39;t distracted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Fabina, it&#39;s supposed to be a party!&quot; Vixie commented, &quot;parties are supposed to be fun. These gentlemen ordered drinks and I brought them drinks... and I thought it&#39;d be a bit fun to thank them for their order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, but the Meat Market is also a business,&quot; Miss Fabina answered as she noted the two glasses of eggnog on the small round table between the two men along with an order of fries between the two glasses of eggnog, &quot;and I&#39;m sure both men paid for their drinks and food?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; one man spoke, though his eyes drifted to Vixie, though not for too long.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, everything was on the up and up,&quot; Trixie commented from another section of the room and while offering a tray of drinks to a both that actually had some Animalians seated at it, &quot;so why not have fun... it&#39;d help keep people warm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... all those blizzards and super cold stuff has to be rough,&quot; Vixie commented, &quot;we&#39;ve seen the reports on the news.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Fabina sighed at that. She had seen the news reports two, much of the country, particularly areas east of the Rockey Mountains were being hit by hard blizzards that had closed roads and, in some places, had caught people unprepared. Some of it even went south into states like Texas, which again couldn&#39;t handle the cold and certain parts of the state either lose power or have to curtail the flow of power because of that cold. Some snow had fallen in Lyre and Animalia, and the temperatures were fairly cold, BUT that hadn&#39;t reached the levels of the blizzards going on further east.<br />
<br />
&quot;One would hope you would recognize that most of the reports on those blizzards was not local to Lyre,&quot; Miss Fabina told Vixie, &quot;and I&#39;m sure everyone here has the means to keep warm. But it is still a business and one that does not trade in sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t some of the money go to help them dig out when it ends?&quot; Dixie wondered as she came around another corner, &quot;Animalia&#39;s Christmas gift to those that got buried in these blizzards?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Fabina thought on that and nodded, &quot;I suppose we could contact the organizations that would handle the relief efforts. We can then see if they would accept relief donations for the recovery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;d accept it?&quot; Trixie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They might,&quot; Miss Fabina asked, &quot;and there would be plenty of organizations that would still possibly accept donations that would be trying to help and would be separate from the government run efforts. And the areas worst hit by all this would surely need help or something related to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot; Vixie cheered as she moved away from the man she&#39;d been rubbing her posterior against, &quot;presents to help people who are cold. Animalia gives the best gifts!&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few cheers that came from the floor and even from the others presently on duty at the Meat Market. It left Miss Fabina with a small sigh and then a chuckle. The bimbos might be progressing slowly with regard to earning their GED and remained a bit too forward in ways that could get the Meat Market in trouble, but it was fairly clear that they weren&#39;t completely blind to outside events and did have some measure of kindness. That was something that Miss Fabina could respect and easily accept, as kindness was always a good thing, and she had to chuckle at how sometimes good ideas came from those one didn&#39;t expect to have them and in ways that weren&#39;t expected to happen as well. In some ways, that did fit the purpose of the Christmas season.</p>
