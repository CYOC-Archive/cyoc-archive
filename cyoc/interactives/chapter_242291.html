<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wait, are we actually doing this?&quot; Mark asked.<br />
<br />
Anna was sitting on her bed. She had a cheerleader uniform on. She looked at her new body in the mirror and smiled. Jennifer&#39;s body looked a lot like Anna&#39;s but with far more muscle and slightly more masculine features. That certainly wasn&#39;t to say that Jennifer wasn&#39;t an absolute knock out. She ran her hand down her chest and felt her perky breasts. She looked over at Mark and smiled, &quot;Looks like we&#39;re stuck together for the summer. I&#39;m already in my uniform and we have to be at the camp in 20 minutes. You should get changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark looked at his body and shivered. &quot;This isn&#39;t fair. I didn&#39;t sign up to live in my girlfriend&#39;s body for the entire Summer!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna laughed, &quot;You are so full of yourself. And don&#39;t talk about me like an object! I&#39;m a person, I&#39;m not just your girlfriend.&quot; She got up and started undressing Mark. &quot;If you&#39;re not going to get ready on your own, I&#39;ll make you get ready. <br />
<br />
Mark pushed her away.  &quot;I don&#39;t need your help.&quot;  He started to change his clothes on his own.  He now wore women&#39;s exercise clothing with the camp logo and his girlfriend&#39;s name affixed to the chest. &quot;I hate this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but there&#39;s nothing we can do about that now.&quot;  Anna guided him out of the door and toward the bus that was not waiting outside the house.   &quot;This is just for a little while, and then everything will go back to normal.  You&#39;ll get used to it, you&#39;ll see.  Now smile.&quot; She grabbed Mark&#39;s arm and pulled him against her side. &quot;I&#39;ll show you that being a girl is all it&#39;s cracked up to be. And maybe you&#39;ll learn a little about me along the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked together to the waiting bus.  Anna waved at her friends and they waved back. They both took a seat on the bus and waited for it to fill up.  Mark was still getting used to his new body, and Anna was clearly enjoying seeing the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter? Not what you expected?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s just not what I&#39;m used to, that&#39;s all. I guess it&#39;s going to take me a little time to get used to being Anna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help with that. You can call me Jennifer. I mean, I guess that would be a little weird if I walked around calling myself Anna. It&#39;ll take some getting used to, but at least you have a hot body to make the transition easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; he said, and smiled. &quot;I can&#39;t wait until we&#39;re back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna laughed. &quot;Come on, it&#39;s not that bad, is it?&quot; Mark noticed Anna staring at his chest like a horny man. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, but it&#39;s just a little weird, that&#39;s all,&quot; said Mark. &quot;I mean, I&#39;m sure you would feel the same way if our positions were reversed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I suppose so,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
They finally arrived at the camp, and it was everything Mark thought it would be. Anna had told him all about the summer camp, but it was nothing like being there. There were girls of all shapes and sizes everywhere, and he was one of them now.  Anna had to grab his hand and lead him away from the bus and into the crowd.  He was stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we have a little time before we need to get to work. You need to relax a little. You are going to be a great camp counselor. All the girls will love you and they&#39;ll never even know you&#39;re a dude. We just have to make sure you learn the rules,&quot; said Anna.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Mark said. He was still trying to process what had happened to him. He was now a woman and he needed to accept that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you need to learn how to walk,&quot; said Anna. She turned and faced him. &quot;Women walk differently than men, and you need to learn the right way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Mark.<br />
<br />
Anna walked over to him and took his hand. She pulled him to his feet and put her arm around his waist. &quot;First, you need to stand with your hips slightly tilted forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like this?&quot; he asked, as he tilted his hips forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, just like that,&quot; she said. &quot;Now, you need to take small steps. Don&#39;t over stride like you&#39;re used to doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, let&#39;s walk,&quot; she said, and she started walking.<br />
<br />
Mark walked with her, but he felt awkward. &quot;Am I doing it right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing great,&quot; said Anna. &quot;You&#39;re a natural. You need to keep your back straight and your hips swaying. Let your arms swing freely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Mark. He tried to follow Anna&#39;s instructions, but he still felt awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing better,&quot; said Anna. &quot;Just relax and let your body move naturally. Don&#39;t think about it too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said. As the two moved, Mark noted Anna&#39;s hands gravitating closer to Mark&#39;s chest.  He also caught Anna biting her lip while looking down Mark&#39;s chest.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You need to work on your posture,&quot; she said. &quot;You need to stand tall and proud, like you own the place. Shoulders back, chest out.&quot; Anna ran her hands along Mark&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like this?&quot; Mark asked as he pulled his shoulders back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, just like that. Now, keep your head up and look straight ahead. Don&#39;t look down at the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; said Mark, as he lifted his head and looked straight ahead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; said Anna. &quot;Now, let&#39;s work on your sitting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sitting?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Anna. &quot;Women sit differently than men. You need to sit with your legs crossed and your back straight. Don&#39;t slouch or spread your legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said as he sat down and crossed his legs. He tried to sit up straight, but it felt awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not like that,&quot; she said. She walked over and stood behind him. She put her hands on his shoulders and pushed them back. &quot;Sit up straight and relax your shoulders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, perfect,&quot; she said. Anna couldn&#39;t stop herself anymore. She reached around and grabbed Mark&#39;s breasts and started to rub them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna! What are you doing!?&quot; Mark jumped up, but Anna held on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never touched my own boobs before. I had to know what they felt like.&quot; Anna&#39;s eyes were wide with excitement and a bit of lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have just asked,&quot; said Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Sorry, it just felt so good to grab them. Jennifer told me that she was Bi-sexual, but I didn&#39;t expect to feel something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still feel heterosexual though.  I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m turning down this possibility down, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m currently interested in women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, but you have no idea what you are missing out on. I&#39;m going to have a hard time giving this body back at the end of the summer and I think I&#39;ll get you to change your mind on doing something together as well.&quot;</p>
