<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tuesday, and Ashlee was having a rough time.  An insane stack of paperwork she was expected to have all completed before she would leave the office until the following week.  And always, there was Kevin, if he wasn’t leering over her shoulder, then he was almost certainly peering at her through the security cameras or something to that effect.  And now, he was really becoming more than she could handle.  <br />
<br />
Always berating, belittling her.  Always complaining that her work effort was inadequate.  Always on her case when there were plenty of less effective people in the office who were given so much more leeway.  <br />
<br />
No.  she couldn’t take even one more moment of this!  She was not going to have that Rat Bastard putting her down even one more time!  Faking a need to use the ladies room, she took her handbag with her and locked herself inside a cubicle where she sat down and started to think.  <br />
<br />
‘What best to do with this?’  She thought to herself, gazing at the ornate Pen, the one that could make it all right for her.  <br />
<br />
‘He may be a Rat Bastard, but that is something he won’t get to really be.  No matter, I’ve got something else, better, planned.’  She decided as she pulled out a small notebook and wrote down:  <br />
<br />
Kevin Cooke will become an Anthropomorphic Brown Mouse, five foot three inches in height and quite timid.  His clothes will adjust to accommodate his new form.  <br />
<br />
While she wouldn’t be able to see it happen, she would see the results soon enough.  Chuckling softly to herself, the rush of the power filled her.  In fact, she now had another idea to complete her manoeuvre:  <br />
<br />
I will become a large Anthropomorphic Lizard Lady, similar to Danielle, but much more muscular, and with light-brown and tan instead of green and yellow for the scales.  The clothes that I’m wearing will disappear leaving me with my handbag and watch which will continue to fit me.  <br />
<br />
This time, she could see it happen, as her soft tan flesh gave way to hard brown scales on her hands, claws emerging to replace the fingernails.  Ashlee could feel her body swelling, thickening as her arms and legs pumped out, her shirt and pants fading away to reveal more and more of her changing body.  Once her bra and underwear were gone, she felt herself grow taller, not by a huge amount but clearly a noticeable amount.  <br />
<br />
“This, is too cool.”  Ashlee gasped as her footwear was next to leave her, while a long flexible tail sprouted from the base of her spine, forcing her to shift forwards a bit.  <br />
<br />
Soon enough, it was over.  And scanning herself, Ashlee felt the new power she packed rippling through her as she flexed each limb in turn.  Slipping put of the cubicle, she looked at her reflection in the opposing mirror.  A stunning image of power and beauty, with arms and legs thick as trunks, her bald head with snout resting on a thick neck, and a surprisingly large pair of breasts.  <br />
<br />
“Odd.”  She murmured to herself as she gave them a tentative squeeze.  Normally they’d look quite small given her current musculature.  “Perhaps when I aid similar to Danielle?”  She guessed as the most likely reason.  <br />
<br />
In any case, there was work to be done.  She knew she’d spent some time in this room so she made one more Note:  <br />
<br />
My lengthy absence from my work desk will go unnoticed.  <br />
<br />
That settled, she set the Notepad and Pen back into her purse, the straps still able to let it rest properly on her wider shoulders as she exited and made for her destination.  <br />
<br />
Entering the office after knocking and waiting for an reply, she set herself down on the chair and waited for Kevin to speak.  She was pleased to see that now, he was far smaller, as small as he often made her feel and looking distinctively nervous as he looked at her.  <br />
<br />
“Y-yes?  Is there s-something you w-want?”  He stammered out, his voice higher in pitch than before.  <br />
<br />
“Actually there is.”  Ashlee replied confidently as she leaned back.  “I really don’t like you packing that kind of workload onto me whenever I’m here.  Always loading me down knowing there’s little to no chance that anyone could handle that amount of work in such a short time.”  Now she leaned in closer, the next part coming out as a growl.  “So I’d appreciate it if you stop putting me down like that.”  <br />
<br />
“I-I-I see.”  Kevin gulped, his nerves clearly becoming frayed now.  “So what, is-is it th-that you want?”  <br />
<br />
“That when I am here, the work I do is the same as what the others get.”  Ashlee gave her answer sternly.  <br />
<br />
“S-sure.  I can do that.”  Kevin managed to get out.  “In fact, you’re c-clearly stressed, so why d-don’t you take the rest of the day off?  With pay.”  <br />
<br />
“You know, I think I will.”  While it was not something that Ashlee had been after, she wasn’t going to pass it up.  <br />
<br />
“Very well, I-I’ll take care of the paperwork.  Y-you’re free to go now.”  Kevin added as he motioned to the door a little too eagerly.  <br />
<br />
Once Ashlee had her things with her (which wasn’t much now) she was in her car and ready to leave when she found a problem with her current form.  Her tail was making it hard for her to sit properly and her boobs were pressing into the steering wheel as a result.  Soon she had the Pen out again and wrote:  <br />
<br />
The front seats of this car will be adapted to allow myself and Danielle to drive it comfortably.  <br />
<br />
Quickly a hole formed in the backrest which Ashlee was quick to slide her tail through.  Now she could finish adjusting it and was soon on her way home.  It felt a little odd, being a large and very muscular lizard lady, driving a car with no clothes on, the seatbelt sliding between her hefty tits, and her bare foot on the Gas, but she became accustomed to it by the time she was home, and let herself in hers and Danielle’s apartment.  <br />
<br />
Resting on the couch, she had her eyes shut as she ran her hands over her new form, pleasant tingles humming through her when she hit particular areas.  She couldn’t help but rub her pulsating labia with one hand while the other massaged her large yet firm breasts, sometimes tickling and teasing the erect teats with her forked tongue.  In short time, she hit the climax as her juices drooled out of her pussy and stained the seat.  <br />
<br />
It was only after this, as she came down from the high, that the sudden, sinking realisation hit home.  After everything she’d chastised Danielle for when she’d still been Dave for his use of the Pen, now she’d just done the very things she’d called her out on.  Slipping into the bedroom just as Danielle came in, wearing a tight pair of jeans with knee-height boots over them.  <br />
<br />
Even if Danielle had cleared Ashlee to use the Pen as she herself had, Ashlee still felt major embarrassment at her current predicament, especially since she’d left her handbag, with the Pen still in it by the couch, where she couldn’t reach it.  <br />
<br />
“Ashlee?  Are you home?”  Danielle called out.  <br />
<br />
“I-I’m in the bedroom.”  Ashlee called back.  <br />
<br />
“Well come on out then.”  Danielle approached the door, unable to see Ashlee who was hiding behind it.  <br />
<br />
“A-Alright, but promise me you won’t get mad.”  Ashlee spoke as she slowly opened the door, and Danielle could see her now, her mouth open at the sight of her.</p>
