<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We find this place very interesting,&quot; Allura spoke on a park bench that was essentially the &quot;roof&quot; on Skull Island, or Dinotopia Aquatica, &quot;there are many things there that are different and new from other aquatic Animalians we have seen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi looked out over the areas of the island that were visible to hir, Beacon, and the one they were presently talking with. There were a couple of small buildings that were there on the top of the island. Most of these came off as snack stands and information booths for things that were for education purposes on Animalia, Animalians, and all things related to them, and on Skull Island the Marine Reptiles of the Mesozoic Era and one armored fish from the Devonian Period. To Allura, even as an Animalian based off of a modern animals, because Anglerfish were generally unknown to most people, she at times felt that she came off as &quot;odd&quot; to many Humans and even some Animalians too. Thus with the Animalians from prehistory, Allura actually felt a bit more &quot;at home&quot; with the Aquatic Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
That included the one seated next to hir and Beacon. Unlike the two Plesiosaur Dinotopians that they&#39;d met, Nellie and Nessa, with Nellie being there for a vacation, this aquatic Dinotopian was smaller. In fact the one they were talking with was in the range in which Human&#39;s normally were in with regard to height. Her neck was also relatively short but with long and narrow, almost dolphin-like head. The big difference there was Allura and Beacon could see two nostrils just in front of the eyes where the Dinotopian&#39;s muzzle jutted forward from her head, whereas the Dolphin Animalians tended to still have their blowhole on the top of their head. The similarities to dolphins didn&#39;t end there. The Dinotopian also had a dorsal fin that was placed in much the same place as dorsal fins were on all female aquatic Animalians, particularly with sharks and dolphins, on the back of her head.<br />
<br />
Her tail was more fish-like, though. The Dolphin and Whale Animalians had tail flukes that splayed out horizontally so help with an up and down swimming motion. The fish Animalians had their tail fluke&#39;s largely go vertically to support a side to side motion. This Dinotopian&#39;s tail was tipped by an almost diamond-like fluke at its tip that came about half way up the tail. It wasn&#39;t exactly like a fish&#39;s but since the fluke went vertically it was indeed &quot;fish-like.&quot; That was actually the thing that first got Allura curious, as shi actually thought the Dinotopian sitting with them was a new fish Animalian. Which made the discovery that the Dinotopian was named Miki and was actually a species of Ichthyosaur called Mixosaurus all the more interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much of that is probably because those of us that have moved here have become animals that have no modern relatives,&quot; Miki answered, &quot;while there are sea turtles and the Saltwater Crocodile will swim out to sea, the marine reptiles that ruled the Mesozoic all went extinct.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you became a Mikisaurus?&quot; Beacon asked.<br />
<br />
Miki actually chuckled at the use of her name in the species, &quot;Mixosaurus… It&#39;s actually a rather small Ichthyosaur from the Triassic Period. In that... among Dinotopians, the species I&#39;ve become is probably the earliest... though, yes, I chose Mixosaurus specifically because of its similarity to my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what was it like transforming?&quot; Beacon asked, &quot;was there anything you were afraid of? Or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had nothing to fear, why do you ask?&quot; Miki wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some curiosity,&quot; Beacon admitted, &quot;as in my case... I went from being a she to shi... fully functional in both directions. And with Allura... I&#39;ve liked it... love it, even. But I&#39;m still a bit curious on things went for others...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It went fine,&quot; Miki commented, &quot;let me tell you about it...&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Entering the inside of Skull Island was something that was a bit intimidating for Miki, partially because of what was known on the island. The part that was above the water wasn&#39;t big, but unlike the barrier islands off of North Carolina or the Texas coast, Skull Island had a very solid foundation that wouldn&#39;t wash away with the tide or storms. From what she&#39;d seen on the news, there was some sandy sentiments that surrounded the island, but that was all underwater and away from what the island itself was made of. The reports suggested that the island&#39;s formation might have been part of some past geological upheaval that went on years before humanity evolved and it was that solid foundation that protected it from sinking into the Atlantic Ocean.<br />
<br />
However, the island&#39;s small size above the ocean surface meant that any development on the island would actually have to be within the island itself. She&#39;d seen the reports that Skull Island had had an underground mansion literally carved out of the rock which was then dumped into the sea nearby and the fact that Horizon had had to hire several high scale construction experts and engineers to enlarge the internal structures for the Aquatic Dinotopians when they moved in in order to make sure that there would be no implosion of the island on itself. It made for near miracle in terms of engineering that Miki had read about but didn&#39;t fully understand. However, because of the nature of the project and the fact that it wasn&#39;t above ground, there was no natural light inside the mansion.<br />
<br />
It was that that actually made Miko a bit nervous as she entered onto the &quot;top&quot; floor from the elevator. It wasn&#39;t so much that it was dark, as Dinotopia Aquatica on Skull Island had its own electrical generator that powered the lights, and this did make it easy to see, but the lights carried a fairly steady hum as electricity flowed to them and she couldn&#39;t help but see the wires that were essentially tacked to the ceiling that would allow for the lights to be kept on while in use. That hum and the sounds of her shoes hitting the stone floor was a bit unnerving, though thankfully, Miki had also known enough about Animalia in general to know that despite the size of some or the more animal features they possessed that could be scary, Animalians had also been openly friendly. Miki knew that and made her way to the posted map and then made her way to the level where Horizon&#39;s main offices were on Skull Island.<br />
<br />
The sign by the door was painted in Horizon&#39;s colors and labeled as &quot;Horizon Light: East.&quot; It was something that gave an indication to Miki that the offices were not limited to just medical procedures for the Animalians that lived here. She carefully made her way in through a sliding door and came in to found a large wooden desk with a pair of secretaries there. One had a plaque posted on the desk that read &quot;Medical&quot; and the other had a plaque that had the sign &quot;Animalian Conversion.&quot; Miki gathered her strength and sat down at the latter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I&#39;m Miki, I&#39;d sent an email about moving here and joining,&quot; Miki spoke, keeping her hands in her lap and hoping to avoid having to mention that it was mostly to lose of the excess weight she&#39;d always been carrying. She&#39;d had medical tests done and found that she had no real glandular problem or deficiency that limit her ability to loose weight, but yet the weight remained. That was the thing that was the depressing as she didn&#39;t have the time to work out more. And since Project Mesozoic was now open and had an office in the area, she was open to it.<br />
<br />
The secretary looked up and nodded, &quot;Okay... miss... Miki, do you have a copy of the relevant paperwork to register for conversion and can I see a copy of your driver&#39;s license.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miki nodded and reached into the bag she&#39;d had with her and presented the base paperwork that she&#39;d had to print and fill out before coming to Skull Island. Most of it was to set up where she was in terms of Horizon&#39;s records and so on. She had to send an email to them with the request and most of what was on the form was essentially the conformation of what she&#39;d received. It was a lot of red tape, but it was something that was &quot;the law&quot; in the US with the intent of making sure that unexpected outbreaks didn&#39;t occur. Miki accepted that and filled it out. As she then moved to get her driver&#39;s license from her purse while the secretary reviewed the information on the form. She could hear the computer keys typing as she did so. After a few moments the secretary returned the driver&#39;s license and then stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we do have all your information and confirmed that your choice is Mixosaurus Cornalianus,&quot; the secretary spoke, &quot;If you&#39;ll come with me, we&#39;ll head back to our transformation room and the doctor will be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miki nodded and was soon following the secretary back down through the hallway that followed through the area. To the right she found that there were some processing centers for fossil DNA that Horizon had been able to collect. To the left were some of the more standard hospital type rooms, including things for check ups and basic health checks. That was something that Miki had also read in some of the online information for things related to Dinotopia Aquatica when she made her decision. That while the hospital area was one of the larger areas in the underground Animalian colony, because of the limited space allowed by the size of the island and the necessity for the internal formations be able to hold the weight of those above them there were agreements that if major surgery was ever needed, that would have to be handled at another hospital on the mainland. Thankfully Dinotopia Aquatica had access to that with the Florida city that Skull Island was just off the coast of.<br />
<br />
She was lead to a changing room which was in the back and was fairly secluded and allowed to wait. Aside from the stone walls, ceiling, and floor, the furnishings in the room were fairly normal and the bed, while a bit oversized for her was still comfortable. She waited there until a rather average looking man came in, whom she assumed to be the Horizon physician in charge of administering the shots.  And this he did do. They didn&#39;t hurt and the doctor gave he a polite welcome before leaving the room. Unlike the door to the hospital/Horizon area of the colony, this door was actually on a hinge and Miki could hear it lock from the outside, another possible safety procedure, likely in case the new Animalian was overwhelmed by its new instincts at first. Of course, with her, that wasn&#39;t likely. Mixosaurus was 3ft long and likely fed on small fish in the Triassic seas. But she knew that the Mesozoic Era had its larger predators and they would surely join as well.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, she could also feel the room growing warmer. In fact as things went on, they got a lot warmer and she could feel herself sweating and sweating hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it wasn&#39;t that hot...&quot; Miki thought to herself and then looked down to her hand and saw some surprise as green-yellow webbing was starting to grow out between her fingers. They itched a little, but it wasn&#39;t too bad. It was in that that she knew she was transforming, though she still couldn&#39;t explain why she felt like she was sweating so much. It was get to the point where the room felt way too hot for her. She started with her shirt and managed to pull it off with no problem, though the room was still too warm for her tastes. As she pulled her shirt off she could feel a tingle in her ears and they felt like they were shrinking. At the same time as her shirt came off, she noticed the long black hairs coming off with it. They were either pulled by her shirt or they feel out when she leaned over.<br />
<br />
As she leaned over, she felt something... or rather didn&#39;t feel something. While she&#39;d never been morbidly obese, Miki had had a bit more weight around her middle than she would have liked. Part of her conversion was to get rid of that extra weight. Joining Dinotopia Aquatica was just a means to help save her costs, and now that was paying off. As she stood up she could begin to see her face pushing forward and rapidly becoming narrow and pointed in front of her eyes with her nose flattening into two nostrils just in front of her eyes with her growing muzzle stretching before her. Her head also tingled a bit as a small triangular fin grew up from the back of her skull. None of this hurt, but there were some of the odd crackling as bones changed and moved, and her new dorsal fin almost tickled a little. However it was the disappearance of her extra weight that most delighted her. That had to be why she was sweating so much. That somehow this was part of the transformation, that as she changed the fat in her body was either moved or converted or fueled the transformation, but that was what Miki wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll get to race the others,&quot; Miki thought happily as she let out a joyful squeal.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And from there my transformation soon finished,&quot; Miki finished to Allura and Beacon, &quot;My tail grew out behind me... and I found that with my breasts and butt.... I didn&#39;t lose that much fat... but then there it&#39;s all in the right places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re happy?&quot; Allura asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Miki smiled and nodded, &quot;I&#39;m slim and trim now... and my enhanced chest hasn&#39;t bothered my swimming that much. It&#39;s fun... and the others were even helpful moving some of my things to the island. So I&#39;m all moved in... and could go for some calamari.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Beacon began, only to be interrupted by Miki&#39;s stomach gurgling.</p>
