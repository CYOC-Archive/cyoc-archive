<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You fold up the letter and let out a deep sigh. All this time apart and he still knew how much you loved that place. You wondered what your mother would think. She was the one that had forbidden you to go back to the zoo all those years ago. She said the place scared her and she wanted you to have no part of it. You couldn&#39;t quite remember the circumstances, but you hadn&#39;t seen the place or your grandfather since you were a young boy. And now, here you were the proud owner of it. Yours, it was all yours. Because he knew you were the only member who truly loved it. You couldn&#39;t wait to see it again.<br />
<br />
You called your boss and let them know there was a death in the family and that you&#39;d have to miss work for a while. Your boss, ever understanding, let you know you could take as much time as you needed. A short plane ride later, you were back. You rented a car and began the drive out to the Midfield Zoo. Due to it&#39;s unique design and unusually friendly animals, as well as exotic attractions, it had long been a local tourist attraction. However, the place was deserted now as it was late at night. You pulled up to the main gate and pulled out the keys that came in the envelope. You pulled out the key marked front gate and inserted it into the box and turned it, watching as the wrought iron gates opened before you. You pulled the key out and drove the car forward, watching in the rear view mirror as the gate closed behind you. You drove up to the main house, a gothic looking castle at the center of the park. As you did, a flood of memories came rushing back. There were a few subtle differences, but mostly the place remained unchanged. You pulled the car up to the front door and turned off the ignition. It all came back to you. The last morning here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not Dad. I cannot have him spend another minute here!&quot; Your mom was arguing with your Grandfather on the stone steps leading into the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; You Grandfather seemed visibly distressed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because he told me he wanted to be part of the zoo. That he wanted to be transformed...into an animal!&quot; Your mother&#39;s voice conveyed a sense of horror. You remember slinking back, feeling ashamed for having told her that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, I would never let that happen! Not permanently, anyway.&quot; Your Grandfather looked past your Mom&#39;s shoulder, directly at you. Somehow, all these years later looking back, you wonder if in that moment he knew that was the last time he would see you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t Dad. I just can&#39;t. I should have left you when Mom did. This place frightened her and it frightens me now. I can&#39;t let my only son be pulled into it too. I just can&#39;t.&quot; With that, she got into the car and started it up. You looked out the window to your crying Grandfather, still trying to remain stoic. You waved goodbye to him and he waved back. Your Mom put the car into gear and the tiny, blue hatchback drove down the driveway, away from the Zoo both you and your Grandfather loved. It was the last time you ever saw him. <br />
<br />
You opened the door to the car and stepped out of it. It was weird being back in this place and having all these vivid memories coming flooding back to you. You walked up the stone steps and pulled out the keys again, unlocking the front door. It opened with a creak as you stepped into the house. You half expected your Grandfather to be seated by the fireplace in the living room, reading a newspaper or in his office, working on the business of running the zoo. But the house felt empty and cold. You notice another letter on the mahogany table in the center of the front hall. You walk over to it and notice it&#39;s addressed to you. You open it and pull out the letter. <br />
<br />
My Dearest Grandson,<br />
<br />
I can tell that my time on this Earth is coming to a close. I wish I had more time with you to explain the magic of this place that meant so much to me and I believe meant so much to you too. When I say magic, I don&#39;t mean in a spiritual sense, I mean literally. I wanted to teach you how it works and how to wield it, but your mother made that impossible. Instead, I left volumes in my office detailing the history of this place and how to use the magic that radiates throughout. It&#39;s not how I would have wanted things to be, but some things cannot be helped. Please know I hold no ill will towards your mother. She is my daughter and I love her dearly. It&#39;s just that her mother has poisoned her against this place. Maybe with time she can she the magic of this place again. Until then, I feel confident I can leave this place in your capable hands. <br />
<br />
Love always,<br />
<br />
Grandpa.<br />
<br />
You fold up the letter and put it back into the envelope. You notice it is getting late and decide to bring in your bag. You go back out to the car and grab your duffel bag. You hear a howl in the distance and look out into the zoo and then notice the big full moon in the sky. You smile to yourself and head back inside, jokingly wondering if Grandpa has a werewolf in his zoo. You were anxious to explore the place and meet the staff, but decided that would wait for morning. For now, you were tired from your trip and just wanted a quick bite to eat and then to sleep.</p>
