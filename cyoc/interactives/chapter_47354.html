<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now I can tell you everything about how this happened,” I said.  “I was afraid to before, but now I’m not.”  I told him everything about the innocent act of kindness and the old woman’s gift of the ring.  I told him about my first accidental wish.  “I kind of hope that didn’t cause too much of a problem, I was just in shock that it worked,” I said.<br />
<br />
“I’ll bet,” Phil said.<br />
<br />
I continued to tell him about how I made the wishes and how it seemed to work no matter the circumstances of my wish, whether they were made aloud or silent.  Then I had to get to the awkward part about how I told him I planted the thoughts in his mind to want to become a woman.  I also told him about the voice in my head that told me he would not be mad.  “Are you mad that I changed you like that?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I suppose I should be, but I’m not,” Phil said.  “You were right that this does feel incredible,” he said as he ran his hands up and down his sexy body.  “Whoever that voice belonged to was right.  I am happy to be like this.”<br />
<br />
“So now I just need to make another wish so you’ve always been a female, too,” I said.  I had already explained to him the conditions of that wish in regards to myself.  “Do you want to be called ‘Phyllis’ now?”<br />
<br />
“Ew,” he said.  “I don’t like the sound of that name at all.  I’m surprised you wanted Josephine.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I wasn’t specific about that,” I admitted.  “But Josephine was an empress, so I think it’s a cool name.  And you can still call me ‘Jo,’ just leave off the ‘e’ from now on.  So what do you want your name to be?”<br />
<br />
Phil thought for a moment.  “I’ve always liked the name ‘Kelly,’ but I’d rather that be a middle name,” he said.  He continued to ponder.  “I want to be ‘Valerie.’  Yep, that’s it.  Make my name ‘Valerie Kelly Ferguson.’”<br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  “I wish that everyone, except for me, will always remember Phil as being a female, and will remember that his name is Valerie Kelly Ferguson and no one will have any memories of Phil as a male and that they will all be replaced by memories of Valerie.”<br />
<br />
“Specific,” he said.<br />
<br />
“I’m not leaving anything to chance,” I explained.  “So…Valerie, I’d better get used to calling you that.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed,” the newly minted Valerie agreed.  “It might look a little weird if you called me ‘Phil’ in public.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, right,” I agreed with a laugh.  “So you’re a female now, but you haven’t felt what it is to be a female yet.”  I smiled slyly.<br />
<br />
“I want to feel like that,” Valerie said.  “Sooner rather than later.”<br />
<br />
“How about now?” I asked.<br />
<br />
Valerie smiled devilishly.  “Oh, yes, please.  I have someone in mind, too,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Who’s that?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“This guy at the coffee place on the corner,” she said.  “He’s pretty cute and looks like he’s decently built.  Oh my god, that sounds so weird to hear me say that.”<br />
<br />
“But does it feel weird?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She tilted her head to one side.  “No, it feels natural, like I’ve always said something like it.  Wow, this really is interesting.”<br />
<br />
I nodded.  “We’ve only started.  Here we go.  I wish that Valerie’s guy from the coffee place would appear here in the room with us, that no one would notice he vanishes from wherever he currently is and, to make things easier, he would not question as to why he’s been transported here.”<br />
<br />
Instantly a third person appeared in the room.  He was a little taller than either of us.  He had a kind of trendy haircut with tips in several places that were frosted blonde.  Valerie was right in that he appeared to be fairly well put together but it was hard to tell since he was dressed.  In fact, he was wearing an apron with the name of the coffee place on it, so it appeared he had been at work.  He looked around the room for a minute to get his bearings.  “Where am I?”<br />
<br />
“You’re in our apartment,” I said.  I walked next to Valerie so that he would focus his attention on us completely.  <br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” he said.  <br />
<br />
“Like what you see?” I teased.<br />
<br />
“Um…yes,” he said.  He swallowed hard.<br />
<br />
“Why so nervous?” Valerie cooed.  “We won’t bite.  At least I don’t think we will.”<br />
<br />
“Do I know you?  You don’t look familiar,” he said.<br />
<br />
Valerie answered, “Oh, you’ve seen us, but—“<br />
<br />
“But not like this, obviously,” I interjected.  I didn’t know what Valerie was going to say exactly, so I took no chances.<br />
<br />
“Jo, I wasn’t going to say anything else,” Valerie pouted.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Valerie, just can’t be too sure,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Jo and Valerie,” our guest said.  “I don’t know, I’d think I’d remember your faces.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it,” I said.  “So now that you know our names, what’s yours Mr. I Work at a Coffee Place That Doesn’t Use Name Tags?”<br />
<br />
“Derek,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Great, now that we’re all acquainted, let’s become friends,” I said.  I walked behind him and untied his apron.  Valerie walked up to him and planted a firm kiss on his lips that he wasted no time in returning.  The only thing that parted their lips was me pulling both his apron and his shirt over his head.  I ran my hands over his back and around to his pecs.  Valerie was right.  He was pretty well built.  He was certainly not a body builder, but he was clearly in shape and worked out to keep himself that way.<br />
<br />
Valerie led him over to the bed.  She was clearly enjoying herself so far.  She fell back onto the bed and he went with her.  This gave me the opportunity to take off his shoes and socks while Valerie unbuckled his belt and unbuttoned his jeans.  Once I had his socks removed I tugged off his jeans and boxers simultaneously.  He had a firm ass that I couldn’t help but squeeze several times.  He had a very generously sized cock that he wasted no time in thrusting into Valerie’s eager pussy.  She moaned in delight instantly.  I remembered to wish for no unwanted complications from this round of sex for either of us.  I also decided to make a wish that anytime Valerie or I had sex with a man that the man would not come until we did.  <br />
<br />
Valerie was, in her first time, not very difficult to satisfy.  It only took a minute for her to scream out in climax.  Derek climaxed as well, just as my wish said he would.  I got on the bed behind him and reached around to run my fingers over his chest.  “Oh, you’re good,” he said.  “Got any left for me?”<br />
<br />
“You bet I do,” he said.  He took hold of my hands and forcefully pulled me in front of him.  He pushed me back onto the bed and thrust his cock into me.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yea, fuck me, stud,” I said.  Just as I had done with Phil, I wrapped my legs around him and squeezed his ass with my feet.  No offense to my old friend Phil, who now lay next to me positively aglow after being fucked as a woman, but this was so much better than my first time.  “Keep…fucking…going…harder,” I screamed as he ravaged my pussy.  I did feel a small amount of pain but the pleasurable feelings far outweighed any such bad feelings.<br />
<br />
“You…like it…rough?” he groaned.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…yea,” I moaned back with a wicked smile on my face.<br />
<br />
“My kind…of girl,” he said.<br />
<br />
Valerie sat up on the bed and looked at us with jealousy in her eyes.  She stood on the bed and placed her legs on either side of my body.  Then she lowered herself to her knees so that her pussy was over my face.  I wasted no time in forcing my tongue into her moist pussy.  While I licked at her I climaxed loudly and Derek shot into me.  Valerie came again soon after we did.  Perhaps she was in too much anticipation, but she seemed to come easier than I did.<br />
<br />
“Damn you two are a couple of nymphs,” Derek said.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure that doesn’t bother you,” I said.<br />
<br />
He chuckled.  “Not really,”<br />
<br />
“That was fun,” Valerie said as she kissed him again.  “We should do it again sometime.”<br />
<br />
“Derek has to get back to work now, don’t you sweetie?” I said while I made a wish that he wouldn’t protest what I said.<br />
<br />
“Yea, before they start looking for me,” he said.  He redressed himself quickly.  As soon as he was finished I made a wish for him to return to the coffee place and that no one would take notice of his sudden reappearance and that he would not question as to how he returned.<br />
<br />
“Why did you send him away so soon?” Valerie asked.  “I could have gone for more.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know ‘bout that, Val,” I said.  “You came pretty quickly.  Twice.”<br />
<br />
“I’m still getting used to this,” she protested.  <br />
<br />
“So am I,” I said.  “Don’t worry about it, you’ll get better.”<br />
<br />
We sat on the bed for a minute and gathered ourselves more.  “I guess I’m bi,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Does that bother you?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“No, it doesn’t,” she said.  “It felt natural.  What about you?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I already know I am,” I said.  “Remember, this is what I always wanted to be, so I knew I would turn out that way.”<br />
<br />
“So you didn’t want to be lovers when I was Phil, but you’d be OK with it now?” she asked.<br />
<br />
I shrugged my shoulders.  “It wasn’t so much that,” I said.  “You seemed to be freaked out by everything before, so that’s what I said.  I also said that after the wish started changing you, so it didn’t really mean anything.  But most importantly, I’d rather be fucked by a man.  Not that I wouldn’t mind having you now and then,” I said as I kissed her on the cheek.  She smiled.<br />
<br />
“What do you want to do now?” she asked.</p>
