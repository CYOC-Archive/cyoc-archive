<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While at home, Rebecca head a knock on her door, but when she reached it, no one was there. Looking to both sides, she didn’t see anyone on the street, as if the person who knocked on the door mere moments ago disappeared.<br />
Then, Rebecca noticed a box on the ground, with the words “To Rebecca Goldstein” written on it.<br />
<br />
Taking it up to her room and opening it, she saw a pair of shoes with instructions near it. “The shoes of height” (yes, the instructions are what’s in the previous chapter)<br />
“It must be a cruel joke” she thought.<br />
While the rest of her close family was tall, with all being at least six feet, 13 year old Rebecca extremely unlucky with genetics, and was very short, only being 4’6”.<br />
Her parents always confronted her that she just has to wait for her growth spurt, but the thing was that her older brother and sister were already over a foot taller than her current stature when they were thirteen, making that claim feel like a mere conformation.<br />
As if to add salt to injury, these two siblings, a pair of 18 year old twins, ended up being taller than both their parents with her sister, Sarah, being 6’2” and her brother, David, being a full on 6’8”. Both Sarah and David enjoyed their height for the most of it, seeing it in a good light, and commonly teased Rebecca about the difference in view point.<br />
<br />
The thing sparked Rebecca’s interest though, and she started reading the instruction.<br />
“ When holding both of them in the hands, the shoes can change to whatever size the person has and to whatever style he/she wants them to be.”<br />
Doubtful, yet curious, Rebecca jokingly held the pair of shoes as a pair of 5” heels, and to her wonder, they did change to how she imagined them. In shock of the change but extreme curiosity, she put them on.<br />
Although uncomfortable, as high heels are, they were a perfect fit.<br />
<br />
“It’s true...” Rebecca said in extreme shock as she tried to balance herself on her new shoes. She enjoyed the higher vantage point, even though it was just due to the higher heels.<br />
<br />
Knowing what is written in the instructions is true and curious about what else is special about what else the shoes have to offer, Rebecca continued reading.<br />
After some explanations, a few about about a time limitation, the following appeared:<br />
“When a person wears both shoes, he/she can change them both freely to whatever type he/she desires, without a time limitation.”<br />
Wanting to try that out, she imagined the heels being a more comfortable pair with only a three inch platform, and they changed accordingly, but looking around, her point of view looked as if she was still wearing 5 inch heels. Removing her shoes, the perspective only partially lowered. She was taller! Strangely enough, her clothes still perfectly fit her.<br />
<br />
Wanting to understand what happened to her, Rebecca finished reading the instructions. After that, she realized.<br />
When she reduced the height of her heels, she took some height from them into her own stature, making her two inches taller than she was originally, and in addition to that, her clothes changed to fit her and everyone would think that it’s completely normal!<br />
<br />
Wanting to test the shoes in a more active situation, she put them on and went downstairs.<br />
Going downstairs, her family noticed she looked taller than normal, until then saw that she was wearing a pair of heels.<br />
“Congratulations about the new shoes honey!” Her mom said. “Where did you get them from?”<br />
“Thanks! A friend gave it to me” Rebecca lied in response.<br />
“You still look tiny to me” her sister Sarah interrupted.<br />
“Sarah!” Their mother scolded her.<br />
“What? Rebecca is still only like one or two inches over four and a half feet... I loom over her even with her new heels.” Sarah said in a defensive response as she stood near her sister to emphasize the still extremely difference in height.<br />
What took Rebecca’s attention the most in her discussion was the height her sister said she was. She would have usually said ‘Like four and half feet tall’, but she said a number a bit higher than that, presumably due to taking a bit of height from the shoes.<br />
<br />
Then, Rebecca decided to put the shoes for a test.<br />
She imagined them as flats, and like before, they changed to what she imagined while her vantage point stayed the same and her clothes stayed fitting. Her family members didn’t notice the change.<br />
<br />
“Alright, maybe I exaggerated a bit” said Sarah suddenly as her mind slightly changed to fit the new reality. “But Becca is still less than five feet”<br />
“Mom, can you measure me?” Rebecca said in response to that. “I think I grew a bit”<br />
<br />
Rebecca went to the wall her family always measured their height in alongside her mother and sister, took off her shoes and stood against the wall as her mother took the measurement.<br />
“It looks like you are still 4’11”, like last week” her mother said, and Sarah said “Told ya” before leaving.<br />
Rebecca thought about how she was five inches taller than in the morning, while her family thought it was completely normal.<br />
<br />
After that event, the rest of the day went seemingly normally, though everything looked smaller for Rebecca while she was still dwarfed by her family members, though by a lesser amount.<br />
<br />
At the end, Rebecca went back to her room with her shoes (still as flats), which barely changed, and went to sleep.</p>
