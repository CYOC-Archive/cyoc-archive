<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve remembered staring at the picture in awe. He remembered feeling both excited and fearful. He was excited with the possibility of this much power, but he was also terrified that he could alter reality itself just like that. He also remembered thinking that he needed to be careful. But, the next thing he knew, he was no longer staring at the photo. It was if he had blinded and was somehow somewhere else.<br />
<br />
He found he was lying on someone&#39;s couch. He slowly sat up and felt his head shout in pain. He remembered this feeling, but hadn&#39;t felt it since his college days. He was definitely hung over. He tried to think of what had happened after the family looked at the photograph but it was all a blur. His body still felt numb, but as feeling slowly came back, he realized something was wrong.<br />
<br />
He looked down and nearly let out an audible groan as he saw two massive breasts looking back at him. He was a woman again. &quot;Great.&quot; He thought annoyed. &quot;Whatever, I&#39;ll just change back.&quot; he thought and was about to do so until he suddenly had a thought. &quot;Wait, I don&#39;t even know where I am or what happened. I should at least figure that out first before I just alter reality again.&quot;<br />
<br />
He carefully stood up from the couch, and began to look around. All over the strange house were college students. There was some guy passed out on the dining room table, another passed out on the floor, two sorority looking girls asleep on the kitchen counter and another girl asleep on the couch adjacent to Steve&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Steve decided he wanted a better look t himself. He carefully navigated the house of sleeping students until he found the house&#39;s bathroom. His jaw dropped when he saw what was staring back at him in the mirror. He wasn&#39;t just a woman, he was a college aged girl version of himself.<br />
<br />
He had curly blond hair that was in complete disrepair, makeup that was smeared across his face, large perky breasts, with a figure and ass to die for. He was only wearing panties and a guys white t-shirt. His large nipples were perky, likely do to being slightly aroused without a bra, and his ass kept getting into a wedgie. <br />
&quot;God, I can&#39;t be older than 20.&quot; He thought as he started making stupid sexy posed in the mirror. &quot;Okay, okay focus Steph, you need to- wait, did I just call myself Steph?&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello my name is Stephanie.&quot; He said out loud. &quot;No I mean Steph. Argh! No I&#39;m a 19 year old com. major. Dammit what the hell!&quot; He yelled annoyed.<br />
<br />
He figured something must have had to have happened the night before, but every time he tried to think back to after he was looking at that photo he just got a splitting headache. Suddenly, his stomach made a few noises as he felt nauseous out of nowhere. He ran over to the toilet, instinctively held back his long hair, and vomited into the toilet.<br />
&quot;Just perfect.&quot; He thought as he finished up and sat back against the wall. &quot;I need to get out of here and find my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked out into the main room and found everyone still asleep. He was about to sneak out when he realized he was still only wearing panties and a shirt. &quot;Dammit I need clothes.&quot; He thought as he looked around the room. He saw various pieces of clothing all over but he had no idea which was his. &quot;I guess I can just put on whatever since I have no way of... wait a second!&quot; He thought as he pulled out his phone.<br />
<br />
He quickly checked the camera role, hoping for something or anything clue was. There were mostly a few random shots of the party which he couldn&#39;t make out, but eventually he finally found a selfie. He thought the girl in the photo looked cute in the purple party dress she was wearing. Unfortunately, Steve&#39;s memory came back a little as he remembered throwing it in the pool to show his tits to some guy he thought was cute. &quot;Geez, I guess drunk me is attracted to guys in this form.&quot; He thought as he cringed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a second.&quot; He thought, realizing wha that actually meant. He raced around the house, looking for the guy, until he finally found him asleep on the diving board. His suspicions were confirmed just by the face. It was Janet but turned into a 19 year old guy. Steve gently tried to wake her up but Janet just groaned. Steve realized she wasn&#39;t gonna wake up anytime soon, so he slugged her over his shoulder and made his way to the front door of the house.<br />
<br />
Steve walked outside, wearing some jeans he promised to return, as she took the sleeping make Janet on a 7 am walk. After a few minutes of walking, they made it back to the house. Steve plopped Janet down on the couch and then he fell onto his chair. He nearly fell asleep himself as he panted for air. His current body was definitely not that strong. After a few minutes, Janet finally began to stir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh.&quot; She whined. &quot;My head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like someone is finally awake.&quot; Steve joked.<br />
<br />
Janet looked around confused as she sat up.<br />
&quot;When did we get back home?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I brought you back a little bit ago.&quot; Steve explained. &quot;Though I&#39;ve got a bit of a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Janet asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t remember what happened last night.&quot; Steve explained. &quot;And I keep calling myself Stephanie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet stared for a moment, then she started to chuckle, which slowly turned onto full on laughing. Steve just watched, getting more confused and annoyed as it went along.<br />
&quot;Jake this isn&#39;t funny! I mean... ugh.&quot; He said, even more annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, sorry, it&#39;s just, you reminded me of back in the day. This used to happen all the time when we dated in college.&quot; She said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I know, but why can&#39;t I say my name, and why are we like this, and where are the kids?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Janet just stared for a moment with a smile before she gestured behind Steve. Steve turned around to see a smiling woman nearly bursting out into laughter. Steve wondered who it was before he realized it looked like an older version of Alan when he was a girl. <br />
&quot;Son, is that you?&quot; He asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Mom to you kiddo.&quot; Alan said almost laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, someone tell me what happened last night right now.&quot; Steve demanded.<br />
<br />
Janet sighed after she finished laughing and then decided to give him the quick version of events.<br />
&quot;Okay. Last night, after we all calmed down from the initial realization of the power we had, we all started talking about how we&#39;d first use our powers. Eventually, you decided you wanted to go back to your college party days. I agreed to come with you but I wanted to mix things up more than that. So after a little persuasion I convinced you to swap genders so we could go as a reversed couple.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why we were at some college party.&quot; Steve reasoned. &quot;So, why can&#39;t I say my actual name?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was my doing Dad.&quot; The middle aged house wife Alan chimed in. &quot;Mom didn&#39;t want to risk you two getting too drunk and then spilling the beans, so I made it so that both of you couldn&#39;t say who you really were until you changed back, and that you wouldn&#39;t try to change back until you got home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was amazed that Alan&#39;s powers could affect thought so well. He didn&#39;t even attempt to change back the whole morning. Whenever it came up, he just brushed it off for some reason or another.<br />
&quot;Wow this is all so... crazy.&quot; Steve said. &quot;So where&#39;s Megan? And why are you a middle aged woman Alan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan is at school. She&#39;s actually being responsible, unlike all of us.&quot; Janet explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m your mother my adorable Stephanie,&quot; Alan teased &quot;because when you guys transformed last night, we suddenly all got new parents to fill your shoes. They did not like the idea of you two going to some party on a school night, so I took their place so you could go no problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you female then?&quot; Steve asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... why are you?&quot; Alan retorted.<br />
<br />
They all chuckled and then Alan stood up with a stretch.<br />
&quot;Okay, this has all been a blast, but I&#39;m gonna take a shower.&quot; Steve announced.<br />
<br />
He was about to change back when Janet interrupted.<br />
&quot;Wait, stay this way, and I&#39;ll join you.&quot; She growled as he approached Steve. Steve noticed a bulge starting to form in &quot;Jake&#39;s&quot; pants and Steve&#39;s female body started to get aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay fine b-but after this we change back!&quot; Steve said trying to sound responsible.<br />
<br />
The two ran upstairs extremely giddy and Alan just chuckled before sitting down on the couch, then turned on some soap opera that he liked din this form for some reason.</p>
