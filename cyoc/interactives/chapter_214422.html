<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlene was surprised by the open kindness that Alice had shown with her visit. It wasn&#39;t something she expected. Sure, Moon Lake was a reasonably small town, only around six thousand people, and that could create a generally pleasant atmosphere that wasn&#39;t often associated with bigger cities or anywhere else. It was certainly better than what she remembered getting in Florida before they left. There had been support for Rachel over her being raped, but a lot of it was rather distant and some seemed almost forced. Like they said they were supportive because they HAD to say that and not much else. Charlene really didn&#39;t expect much more than that at Moon Lake, generally because people had their own lives to live, people couldn&#39;t just drop everything to help them in every possible way. <br />
<br />
Of course, some of her surprise came the mention of &quot;what happened.&quot; Some of it came from the fact that neither she nor Rachel said much over what had happened that lead to Rachel becoming a werecat. There were therapists in Florida, but a big part of Rachel&#39;s issue was that the rape had also turned her into a werecat and that was something a normal human therapist wouldn&#39;t respond well to, and at various times, Charlene had seen the signs of guilt and hurt on Rachel&#39;s eyes that really didn&#39;t want to dwell on that moment of weakness. All of that had been part of the reason for the move to Moon Lake, and which Charlene was thankful for the help from the bouncer from Cat&#39;s Eye Club for helping her get in contact with, and likely explained the details surrounding what happened to Rachel to the city government, and which in turn helped them get the house that they were now living in. But ultimately, the only ones that Charlene thought knew about what happened to Rachel were those at the college and in the city government. Otherwise, they&#39;d been pretty quiet on things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I must say thank you for the help,&quot; Charlene managed, &quot;we pretty much got the furniture in and things like that... but there are somethings still to sort. DVDs, books, and so on. It&#39;s not much in terms of the total volume, at least when compared to setting up beds, tables, and everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see,&quot; Alice noted looking at the cardboard boxes laid out on the floor of the living room. There were a couple of empty bookcases and other things lying about as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... it&#39;s all still something I never really expected,&quot; Charlene continued, &quot;that everyone would have their own lives and even if friendly, wouldn&#39;t go out of their way to help someone who is a stranger to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... to a degree, Moon Lakes weres will in general have some sense of understanding of your oldest daughter&#39;s position,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;weres can have very lengthy life spans... four hundred years, provided they don&#39;t overtax their systems fighting of parasites or get into a situation that leads to a violent death. Those in Moon Lake that would be close to that maximum age today may have had family that experienced the last &quot;were hunts&quot; in Europe. Where they were hunted and killed because they were weres. That their existence made them seen as monsters, and even at times when people believed in them... it was more often seeing them as monsters, and they were often helpless to fight that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene slowly nodded at that. She wasn&#39;t a fan of horror movies, but she did generally know that those that involved werewolves generally treated them as the monster to be killed or a curse to be removed. Seeing Rachel in control of herself after finding out Rachel had become a werecat provided a good contrast to what Charlene had known about weres in pop culture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, my daughter&#39;s situation is a bit different,&quot; Charlene spoke, &quot;it wasn&#39;t old fears of racism or speciesism... or just hatred of weres. It was a personal betrayal and violation of her person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Alice nodded, &quot;but most weres will sympathize with her and see a lot of their old fears and pains in her struggles in dealing with what Moon Lake would consider a rogue did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is good... though... I must ask, how did...?&quot; Charlene wondered, while noting Megan staying close to Alice&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a teacher at the high school,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;one of the few normals on the staff...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal...&quot; Charlene wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal human,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;my parents moved to Moon Lake about twenty-eight years ago. My mom was pregnant with me at the time, thus only my dad could go through with the Mandatory Were Law&#39;s requirements. After learning about some of the special abilities and perks that certain weres had... he became a werefox, pledging to bond to my mother. Supposedly he felt that bond form even before his transformation was completed. He then doted on my mother through her pregnancy and until after I was transitioned over to a bottle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why that long?&quot; Charlene asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad says that he was told that if he turned my mother while she was pregnant with me... it would have taken my choices away and I would have been born a werefox,&quot; Alice explained, &quot;and the same would apply to when I was nursing. Dad was willing to wait, and mom supported him... though, he was very eager for when he could turn mom... and nine months after that night, my baby brother was born. And I grew up as a normal child in a family of werefoxes. It was fun and happy, and I could always see weres for the PEOPLE they were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene smiled a bit as she listened to the story. She wasn&#39;t sure why.<br />
<br />
&quot;My wife&#39;s family moved here when she was fifteen, and in theory she was old enough that Moon Lake would allow the conversion, provided the were that did it was the same age as her,&quot; Alice continued, &quot;but ultimately, she couldn&#39;t make a decision and her older brother made it quicker than she did. Once that happened... my wife felt freer to take her time. We met in high school, fell in love, and settled down here. I went to Moon Lake College and got my teaching certificate; my wife worked to the city&#39;s post office... and we had our time to make any choice on whether or not we become weres or what weres we would become. And we adopted Megan. And since she&#39;s been with Moon Lake normals with biological family that are weres, she&#39;ll never be under pressure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds all rather happy,&quot; Charlene commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma&#39;s fur tickles,&quot; Megan added, which only let Charlene smile a bit more as there was another reminder on when Rachel, Jasmine, and Michelle were Megan&#39;s age.<br />
<br />
Alice gave a small smile, though it soon became a bit distant, which Charlene noted. She guessed it was some measure of pride and loneliness, as there had been something said earlier that indicated that Alice&#39;s wife did not meet so happy an end.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was happy...&quot; Alice said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Charlene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a car wreck,&quot; Alice said slowly, &quot;my wife had an errand to run that took her to Seattle. I told her not to go, but she insisted... and went out. We were only an hour away, so I ultimately figured things would be fine. But then she didn&#39;t return for five hours... and then the phone rang. It was some emergency services... apparently after getting back onto the smaller roads that lead to Moon Lake, some idiot truck driver tee-boned her car and knocked it down a mountain. Moon Lake&#39;s doctors said not even a were would have survived the injuries she sustained... not that that was any consolation. I lost my wife and Megan lost a mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Charlene found herself apologizing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Alice managed a smile, &quot;I have lots of pictures and Megan is a loving reminder... so, I miss her, but I&#39;m okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene felt a bit better at that, and that let her return to the question that had gotten her started on the present discussion with Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that still doesn&#39;t come to... how... well... you know,&quot; Charlene spoke carefully as she didn&#39;t want to alert Megan to things that were potentially frightening for a young child.<br />
<br />
&quot;That had more to do with your family being new to Moon Lake, and like kids everywhere, the students at Moon Lake were curious about new faces,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;from what I&#39;ve found out... based on what conversations were going on in the classroom, the new family that came in already had a were in the family that was going to college... and that how that were became a were... was... well, not planned or agreed to. I&#39;d known that you were new to the area, and in that... I had the fear or worry that you might need some help and assurance that things would be safe for you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, mommy made a pie to welcome you and assure you that you&#39;ll all be safe here,&quot; Megan said, &quot;and hoping that all could be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s all very nice,&quot; Charlene answered, &quot;and it&#39;s nice to feel welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene was happy to see that the two women were soon sorting through the books that were to go on the bookshelves and the DVDs and movies that the Covaks had with them. It was nice and friendly and felt warm. She didn&#39;t expect it, though as she thought back on it, some of Alice&#39;s answers were probably part of what Jasmine and Michelle had commented on the previous night. They were new, which drew attention, and Jasmine was more likely to see who was available and who was interesting, which would all likely lead to questions because they were new. And while Alice may not have listened in on these student conversations, Charlene could remember how a lot of high school gossip worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said... Even if you&#39;re not part of a pride or a pack, if someone goes through something like that, we will do what we can to help,&quot; Alice spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would that include possible things to help with other things... I mean, what happened really hurt my oldest,&quot; Charlene said slowly, &quot;and there are times where I really don&#39;t know what I can do to make her feel better. I mean... the Town Chancellor told me about a therapist she could see, and my daughter isn&#39;t averse to seeing her. But there are sometimes where I&#39;ve thought that maybe if I were a were... or a werecat, maybe my daughter wouldn&#39;t feel so hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a complicated thing,&quot; Alice spoke with a tone of warning, &quot;for one thing, with werecats... they&#39;re all at least bisexual if not homosexual. If you&#39;re straight... that conversion WILL change your sexuality and to a great degree wouldn&#39;t relate to what happened to your daughter. It won&#39;t make her feel stronger or anything like that... and if your decision to become a were is merely to help your daughter feel comfortable... you&#39;d be becoming a were for the wrong reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene looked down for a moment, though it wasn&#39;t long before she felt a warm hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becoming a were is a big thing,&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;and there are all sorts of choices out there... and once one becomes a were, there is no going back. Thus, if becoming a were is what YOU want, it should be for your reasons, not for anything connected to what&#39;s happened to your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I want to help my daughter... and I don&#39;t know fully on what to do,&quot; Charlene spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re a good mother, right?&quot; Alice asked and waited for Charlene to nod, &quot;being a good mother makes a lot of it understandable. And if something were to happen to Megan and I thought rushing into something might help her... every mother&#39;s instinct would be to do that. But I&#39;m sure your daughters know you&#39;re a good mother too. For the moment... the best you can do is be there for her. Be a shoulder for her to cry on and let her talk to you... and you talk to her. Even with therapy... sometimes the best help will always be family and a friendly position, not simply becoming like your daughter to look like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you and your wife...?&quot; Charlene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and I think my wife actually wanted to the most,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;our question is more on which were to be. And that&#39;s something that takes time... and to a degree, we have time for the moment to make that choice, and for some good reasons. Even after she died... some of that desire was still there on my part. Some of it relates to being able to be with my biological family...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, should go foxy, like grandma,&quot; Megan managed, finding a bit more bravery as she watched the two women sort things and put them on the shelf.<br />
<br />
Charlene found herself chuckling a bit at that. She respected Megan&#39;s bravery, particularly as the young girl had seemed fairly nervous at first. She also found she couldn&#39;t be too critical of Alice given that she&#39;d also shared information that had involved the death of her wife. Charlene had issues with her husband divorcing her for Rachel&#39;s sexuality, but that was nothing compared to losing a loved one to a car wreck.</p>
