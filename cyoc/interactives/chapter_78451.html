<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mother disappeared in a puff of smoke driving the Nobles into a frenzy. They began to blame the King, claiming <br />
it was all a ruse, the Queen was never here and he planned to rob them of their jewels. The King was <br />
protesting that she was real and had disappeared. I too was confused Morgana hadn't just turned her into a <br />
billy goat or something but I suppose this would have to do for now. That's when I spoke up,<br />
&quot;I am Princess Sara of the West Kingdom and with the disappearance of my Mother and Brother, and the untimely <br />
death of my Father, I am rightful heir to the throne of the West!&quot; I pronounced with as much force as I could <br />
to hide my nervousness. To my surprise and gratitude everyone turned to me in stunned silence. A noble wizard <br />
cast a spell to confirm I was telling the truth that I was who I said I was and announced it to the gathering.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose that is true then that you are next in line to the throne, Princess.&quot; I heard and many agreed, &quot;we <br />
should leave this daft country and return to the West for your coronation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! A wedding was promised between our countries and if I can't marry the Queen I'll marry her daughter!&quot; The <br />
King said. I was disgusted and couldn't help but show it.<br />
&quot;I would never marry a man such as you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmph! Whoever heard of a Queen ruling a country?&quot; he was cheered on by most of the men gathered and some of <br />
the women. Morgana gritted her teeth and clenched her fists at the remark. The King continued, &quot;so be it. You <br />
can marry my son Conrad in my stead!&quot;<br />
<br />
Conrad appeared beside her with an approving cheer from the crowd. He must have come here from the church with <br />
the guests. He looked to be quite handsome I'll admit and had the same roguish charm and confident air about <br />
him as Connie had when we first met.<br />
<br />
It was then that things took yet another surprising turn. The crowd noticed Maedel and Morgana.<br />
&quot;Who are they? Don't tell me it is that foul witch Morgana and her lackey?&quot; they said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm no lackey&quot; said Maedel offended. I ignored her and encourage Morgana to let me handle this. With so many <br />
sword carrying nobles, and perhaps even some magic users in the crowd, more transformations could be a rather <br />
bad idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she is. I bested her in a game of wits and combat and she swore fealty to me,&quot; I tried to sound as smug <br />
as possible, &quot;I have her under a spell of obedience, isn't that right, Morgana?&quot; I asked before whipsering <br />
&quot;play along,&quot; she whispered back that I'd be regretting this soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is right, Sara.&quot; She replied unemotionally.<br />
&quot;How many times have I told you, you will address me in the proper manner! Honestly, you really are <br />
dimwitted!&quot; I chided her. If she was going to punish me for this small humiliation I'd make sure she was <br />
humiliated too.<br />
&quot;Yes, Princess Sara.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd seemed convinced and impressed with my strength of character. Now I just had to diffuse this Wedding  <br />
situation.<br />
&quot;My apologies to you Prince Conrad but I have no plans to marry a complete stranger. Marriage can wait as far <br />
as I am concerned as I have far more pressing concerns such as the well being of my Kingdom,&quot; it looked to <br />
have been accepted for the time being, &quot;as well as the disappearance of my Brother and Mother&quot;<br />
<br />
I took this opportunity to discreetly ask Morgana what she had done with my mother.<br />
&quot;Lets just say there won't be any counter claims to the throne for the foreseeable future,&quot; she smiled making <br />
me uneasy.<br />
<br />
We left Molossia. I was under Royal Guard travelling with the Nobles back to West kingdom. I took Arn with me <br />
telling the guards she was my handmaiden. The King insisted that Conrad travel with us and that I spend the <br />
time getting to know him and I acquiesced. I could always avoid him once I got back to the Kingdom or even <br />
send him packing... or have Morgana make him into my Royal steed. I was sure his muscular body would make for <br />
a perfect horse. The thought of riding his strong body between my legs excited me. Clearly I'd been with <br />
Morgana for too long. <br />
<br />
Morgana and Maedel had not traveled with us. Morgana said she'd catch up once she'd made arrangements to move <br />
our little forest hideaway to West Kingdom. Maedel not wanting to leave Morgana's side lest the witch <br />
disappear leaving her stuck in a wooden body. Morgana also took most of the &quot;soldiers&quot; she'd acquired with her <br />
and even the new &quot;Master&quot; of the slave girl and the husband of the bride. The last I'd seen she'd turned the 3 <br />
new maids and the 3 remaining untouched soldiers into horses to help with the travel, saying she had expended <br />
a too much magic to teleport so many again. Doubtless they were three bucks and three mares. She'd given me <br />
the original French maid she'd christened &quot;Fifi&quot; as a parting gift a long with another smaller gift. &quot;You had <br />
better take this. It could be a week until we see each other again and I know how hot and bothered you get,&quot; <br />
she said winking at me before handing it over. It was the Black Dildo that had been a man not long ago and it <br />
vibrated slightly of its own will when I touched it. I didn't thank her an awkwardly held it between my finger <br />
and thumb before handing it to Arn to stash somewhere.<br />
<br />
On the journey back to the West Kingdom something peculiar was beginning to happen to Arn. She swore she <br />
wasn't ill but awoke throwing up each morn. I had a medicine man take a look at her and what he said surprised <br />
both of us. &quot;It seems your Elf friend is pregnant. Congratulations!&quot;<br />
&quot;I swear I haven't done anything with a man!&quot; Arn, my once brother Andre swore looking flushed with <br />
embarrassment.<br />
I looked at Arn incredulously. I'd heard Andrew had always been a hit with the ladies and quite happy to bed <br />
them but didn't believe my little brother would be so careless even after several women came claiming to be <br />
bearing his children. He steadfastly protested. Now I believe those stories were true. It seemed to me that my <br />
brother had been a sex hungry pest before his change but now he'd have to face the consequence of his <br />
coupling. &quot;Really brother? You could have at least saved yourself for a Prince...&quot;<br />
<br />
Still he protested innocence.</p>
