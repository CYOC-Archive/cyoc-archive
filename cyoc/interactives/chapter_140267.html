<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Exactly the filly he was searching for! Sophie was slowly trotting forward, tired by the run he forced her to endure, and she didn’t realize he was there yet, only a couple dozen meters behind her. The mare was exhausted, she probably wasn’t used to long runs and in the escape she had to carry his overweight past self.<br />
<br />
‘Wait a second, where exactly is my previous large belly and pudginess?’ The horse man gropes his arms and flank to assess his body ‘My fat is almost completely gone, only powerful muscles remained in its place. Guess they don’t want overweight horses…’<br />
<br />
In the time Mark lamented his previously much unwanted fat Sophie made her way inside the clearing, fumbling among the thin layer of mud uncovered with her passing, just under the thin layer of healthy and lush grass.<br />
<br />
‘Wait, mud? The ground before this area was completely dry, what is different here?’ In the meantime Mark approached the edge of the forest and after hiding himself behind the trunk of a tree he peered around for other animals or a retrieval team of attendants, noticing only how the herbs in the glade were seemingly healthier and more appetizing than in the entire forest.<br />
<br />
Sophie most likely was in agreement with him, because she leaned down before reaching the middle of the circle and started to graze, sampling the various herbs in her reach. Mark’s mouth was already watering, tempting him to join the filly in the impromptu meal when Sophie started down for a new spot and was unable to extract her right hoof from the mud. First with exasperation and then with mounting panic, Sophie tried to free each and every one of her hooves one at a time, without any success. After the repeated failures the scared mare threw caution at the wind and whinnied and wriggled in a manner reminiscent of a wild horse, not managing to move even by an inch, as if her legs were encased in concrete.<br />
<br />
‘She’s completely stuck. But why, she never had problems before to continue through the mud filled ground, things changed only when she took a bite of grass…’ Understanding filled his eyes when he put the pieces of the puzzle together.<br />
<br />
‘It’s a trap! Of course, many changed persons are transformed in animals inside the forest, and some try to escape, so a set of traps through the woods to catch the various panicked and clueless escapees is a must. And since the escapees are newly changed horses, not used to the instincts and urges, they placed the best hidden snares in seemingly innocent places for a tired and scared animal, like a clearing with particularly appetizing grass or the shores of a stream or pond, I bet.’ He stared at the struggling mare with desire and longing for a few seconds, before gazing forlornly at his increasingly stiff hands.<br />
<br />
His ears perked up when the powerful scent of pheromones assaulted his senses, prompting him to flare his wide nostrils to take a long sniff of the sweet aroma. This clearing clearly saw many daring escapes in the past, the scent lingering in the spot, among them a sizable number of stallion and mares, with a sharp tang of fear in the air. All the fillies in fact were in season when they crossed this clearing…<br />
<br />
If Mark concentrated he could detect the scent of the filly before him, and just as all the others she was in heat, like his throbbing member reminded him. He bit his lips in indecision, how could he discard an opportunity like this? He was a stallion, she was a mare, the attendants were after Georgina…<br />
<br />
The trap sprung when Sophie ate the grass among the mud, as long as he left it alone it should be safe for him, right?<br />
<br />
His feeling were conflicted, the remaining human part of his conscience screamed at Mark how this was wrong and undignified, while the growing instincts and mind of the horse whispered insidiously how it was normal to give in to the pleasure, as animals didn’t care for modesty and decency after all. The choice was all but decided when he started to massage his erect shaft with both hands. With a renewed gait he walked to the obvious mare from behind, with only one purpose in mind.<br />
<br />
“Why, hello Sophie” Mark purred to the inattentive filly, that turned her head to him with a sudden jerk “Fancy seeing you here. You abandoned me before, didn’t you? I believe you are long overdue a bit of punishment for that”<br />
She shuddered when one of his fingers slipped inside her soaked slit with no warning, and started to twirl the appendage inside of her in a circling motion, all the while her tail raised higher and higher.<br />
<br />
“Here I am strolling through the woods, mindful to not cross the path of one of the attendants, to witness you stumble in one of the traps, left alone and stuck in the mud. Well here I am to assist the fair lady, even if you probably expected the knight and not, well, the mount. From my position and the fountain of juices dripping on the floor I can safely assume that you are very willing to entertain me…”<br />
<br />
A quivering of her folds and a wink are the only answer he received, and he took advantage of the acts by pressing her clit mid-wink, sending a new rush of dripping fluids outside her slit and soaking completely his hand and arm.<br />
“Well my fair filly I guess I can see to your needs” With those last words Mark repositioned his hands on her flanks and parted her folds with a slow and constant push, letting the animal instincts guide him. His thrusts started slow, gaining speed and passion as his arousal grew and Sophie synched with his pace, accepting his lover completely inside of her. This dance continued for several minutes amid grunts, whinnies and the sound of pounding flesh, with the two lovers momentarily forgetting about their problem and only focusing on the present, their mutual pleasure and the way their erogenous parts rubbed against each other. The filly was the first to reach orgasm, with her wet folds clamping his shaft, and in that moment of bliss the stud released inside her, closing his eyes and missing entirely how his hands twisted into hooves and he now leaned completely on the mare’s back to stand upright.<br />
<br />
‘This was… even better than what I expected from my dream…’ The stallion panted in exhaustion on the top of the mare, before dislodging himself from the position, or at least trying. Mark’s tail shifted nervously as the now fully horse tried to raise his back hooves from the mud without success like the filly before him, then pulled back to remove his shaft from the place it was currently nested into, again with poor results.<br />
<br />
His shaft was stuck too, only inside the mare, and in this new situation he drew blanks for plans. Judging from the fact that the filly pushed again against him, urging to continue his ministrations, Mark needed no more incentives in his state, and graciously accepted the advances of the willing filly with a powerful thrust, renewing the lustful dance of mating and forgetting his woes anew.<br />
<br />
The attendant arrived half an hour later riding on the same stallion as before, then burst out laughing after she saw the two horses stuck in an unmistakable position, locked in the act and glaring at her “Oh my Mark, if you really wanted to mount our Sophie that way there was no need to elope with her, a word with one of us and we would have happily obliged. We would have given a fitting stall and privacy to the new couple, you know. Up until now I was worried that you two were long gone by now, unlike Georgina and Princess that were just  caught at the northern exit, with the help of my fellow employee we guarded the doors and perimeter of the entire area to intercept you both. Imagine my surprise when I found you two mired in one of our traps, the stallion embarrassingly stuck with his cock inside the mare, you could not resist, am I right? You barely moved from the place I whipped Mark! All this time we all thought that you outwitted all the zoo personnel  but you were only here succumbing to your lust. Don’t worry stud, this is not the last time you will have quality time with Sophie, or even other mares, I guarantee it. I believe that your partner just began her journey as a lustful filly and need the help of a virile stud to become permanently property of the zoo, what do you think? Interested?”</p>
