<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan and Kyle stood together, holding their hands in a goodbye. Kyle&#39;s eyes were wet as he looked at him, and suddenly pulled him into a hug. Dan gave in, and hugged his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude... I just can&#39;t believe you&#39;re leaving, and in such a short warning!&quot;<br />
<br />
Since they were 7, Dan and Kyle were an unseperateble dou, and as they grew up, their friendship only got better and stronger. They have never been apart for long, and basically visited each other every day-Dan went to Kyle&#39;s farm most of the time, because his apartment was pretty small. And, no, the farm wasn&#39;t actually Kyle&#39;s-it was his girlfriend&#39;s parents farm, but he lived there since last year, when his parents died in a car crush. The Smith family took him and cared for him, and he decided to stay and become a part of their family buisness, a decision the Smiths saw as a blessing.<br />
<br />
Dan sighed. &quot;I know... the company is forcing me to move. They&#39;ve opened a new office really far away, and they want me there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine... we&#39;ll miss ya. For how long are you going? Will we see you in time for Katie&#39;s birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie was Kyle&#39;s girlfriend, and her birthday was in two weeks. Dan chuckled sadly. &quot;No, I won&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You&#39;ve never been without us for more than two weeks! How would you survive?&quot; laughed Kyle, trying to figure out why his friend looked so sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, I, I... Listen. I&#39;m going to be there for a really long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five years!&quot; shouted Kyle in disbelief, his eyes wide open. &quot;Please, tell me it&#39;s a joke! Five years?! and were are you going anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To Italy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What.&quot; said Kyle, looking deep in Dan&#39;s eyes, and his eyes widened in fear. &quot;Dude, you can&#39;t be serious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. I&#39;m sorry, Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-but-it means you won&#39;t be here for five whole years!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Believe me, if I could turn down this thing, I would have, but the boss really wants me there, and he started to make threats about me getting fired if I won&#39;t take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So get yourself fired! Come on, you can work here! The Smiths will love you, they&#39;re amazing, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on over there?&quot; asked a familiar voice. The boys turned around and found Katie standing behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you had any idea he&#39;s going out?!&quot; shouted Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he told us both...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But did he tell you where to? And for how long?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five years in Italy!&quot; shouted Kyle, tears raining from his eyes. Katie was stunned. Dan was her best male friend (after her boyfriend, of course), and she knew him long enough to know this isn&#39;t his descision. She looked at him, and he nodded, understanding her unspoken question.<br />
<br />
&quot;They forced me. They want me in Italy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can work here.&quot; she said, cutting him off. He sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, Kate... You know how much I hate this idea. Really. I wish I could stay here with you guys... but you know it won&#39;t work out. I&#39;ll be useless around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
They knew Dan was right. Dan was smart and overall a great person, but his physical wasn&#39;t that good, and he hated working with animals. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, this is it, than?&quot; cried Kyle, trying to cover his tears in no avail. &quot;That&#39;s our goodbye?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan was crying too. Katie hugged him and gave Kyle a kiss. &quot;Boys, don&#39;t be so dramatic. Dan will come back eventually...&quot; but even she knew her words were empty. She was so sad of Dan&#39;s announcment, and couldn&#39;t imagine how Kyle probably feels about this.<br />
<br />
The group hugged together, trying to look barve for each other. &quot;We will miss you, dude,&quot; said Kyle, and tried to fale a smile. &quot;Just try not to do a Romania again...&quot;<br />
<br />
The group laughed, and parted, looking at each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it, than.&quot; said Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep in touch,&quot; responded Kyle, and they hugged again. They parted, and Dan picked up his bag from the ground. He started to walk away, shedding his tears, as he heard a new sound coming from behind him. &quot;Wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Monica...&quot; he said, turning around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle have just called. Is is true? Are you actually leaving? Dude, be honest with me. Kyle sounds-and looks-so broken. If it&#39;s a prank, it&#39;s a really bad one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a prank. I&#39;m really leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica looked at him, stunned. Dan? Leaving Kyle? &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The company is forcing me... Listen, Monica, I need to go. I&#39;ll tlk to you on my way tere, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Wait!&quot; she said, holding his hand. Kyle and Katie got closer, and Dan placed a calming hand on Kyle&#39;s shoulder, confronting him.<br />
<br />
Monica looked at him, anger flashing in her eyes. &quot;So that&#39;s it? You&#39;re just leaving?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Monica... I really, really wish I didn&#39;t have to... Do you really think I prefer money over Kyle? I&#39;m only doing it because I have to... And I promise you all, I will be back. But now, I have to go. Goodbye, everyone!&quot; he said, tears still rolling on his face, and turned around towards his car.<br />
<br />
Monica took a deep breath. &quot;Stop,&quot; she said, and Dan did. &quot;I don&#39;t want to do this... but it seems like I have to. Kyle,&quot; she raised her voice, facing him. &quot;Do you wish Dan to stay here with you? Will you do everything to stay together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; he said. &quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you, Dan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously. If I could, I would&#39;ve stayed, but again, the company-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the company! Let me say it like that: Dan, given that all your financial problems are fixed, and you&#39;ll find a job that suits you right here, will you take it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, duh. Do you actually think I want to leave? Are you nuts?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to confirm... I think I can help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Kyle. He looked at her, pleading. &quot;Please, tell me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica took a long breath, and looked at the group, who looked at her back in wonder. What did she had to offer?<br />
<br />
&quot;Kate... come with me,&quot; she said to her best friend, and the girls walked into an empty barn, whispering to each other. The boys just stood next to each other, not knowing what to say.<br />
<br />
The girls came back, huge smiles on their faces, though Katie also looked... frightened?<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I think Monica can really help you guys,&quot; she said. Monica nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what is it? What&#39;s your solution?&quot; asked Kyle eagerly. He would do anything to keep his friend!<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve agreed not to tell you, at least not for now. All we want to hear from you is this... Dan and Kyle, I have a way to make you both stay here, with Katie, but sacrifices will has to be made... Dan, Kyle, will you do anything for this opportunity?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys looked each other in the eyes. &quot;Yes,&quot; they called together.<br />
<br />
Monica grinned, and Kate looked at her in joy, but also in slight fear. &quot;And Katie? Do you agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, umm, yes. Yes, as long as they do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; said Monica. Suddenly, a white flash of light sparkled from her hands, and the boys looked at her in amazement. &quot;How did you-&quot; started Kyle, but than stopped and looked around. Monica wasn&#39;t with them anymore. It was like she vanished into thin air. &quot;Monica!&quot; he started shouting. What was that light? Did it hurt Monica?<br />
<br />
Dan joined him, but Katie hushed them. &quot;Boys, she&#39;s not here anymore. You see... she&#39;s a witch. And I know you wouldn&#39;t believe me, but she is. She proved it really well to me troughout our long years of friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys laughed nervously. What did Katie ment by that?<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys...&quot; she started, but then stopped and sighed. &quot;Yeah, you won&#39;t believe me, so I&#39;ll get to it right now. See, Monica casted a spell on you two... a spell that will make your wish come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t care about Monica&#39;s witch thing as much as he cared for Dan. &quot;I don&#39;t care how, and I don&#39;t know why are you saying all those wierd things, but do you really have a solution?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked at Katie, and was shocked to see she wasn&#39;t joking. &quot;Kyle... I think she is serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. Thank you, Dan. Now, will you please listen to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys nodded, eager to hear what&#39;s going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monica has casted a spell on you-yes, I am serious, stop it-that will give you both te opportunity to stay together, right here in the farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what exactly will it do?&quot; asked Dan, skeptical.<br />
<br />
&quot;The spell... will turn you both into...&quot;</p>
