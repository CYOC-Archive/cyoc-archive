<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On a small space colony on meteoroid stop 19284 housed a large spread out city on the meteroid&#39;s surface, but that&#39;s all that existed on said stop. There was people living there only to maintain the stop, and most people came and left while traveling from planet to planet. That said the meteoroid stop had several problems which would often cause deaths. An accidental explosion in a mine, a subway accident, out of control parties, etc. Once the computers realize who died they then fix the ratio by changing certain citizens to keep up the amount of possible relationships. <br />
One of the citizens Mike Celest woke up and got ready for school. He went downstairs and sat down at the kitchen table after he had grabbed a plate of eggs that his mother had just made for him. Mike said &quot;thanks for the food mom!&quot; <br />
his mother smiled and said &quot;Your welcome, now eat your food properly instead of just wolfing it down.&quot; <br />
You smirked and just forklifted a big spoonful into your mouth and then after swallowing you felt a large rumbling and wondered out loud &quot;wasn&#39;t that coming from that dorm with all those college girls?&quot; <br />
your mother wondered &quot;I hope they are all right...&quot;<br />
A small computer window opened in front of you saying &quot;Bomb exploded in woman dorm room. 5 dead and 12 injured. After running some tests you have been found good to be turned female in order to keep the population of women and men stable.&quot; <br />
You sighed and braced for the change as you felt estrogen being leaked into your system as some nanobots were converting testosterone into estrogen. Besides that your implants were starting to warp your body around. Your bones started to tighten themselves smaller, your chest started to puff out a bit as your dick was being absorbed to make way for a womb and eggs. Small changes occurred all around until you were your 12 year old self except as a girl. Looking at your chest you saw that you were about a large A-cup, and were probably 4&#39;9&#39;&#39; considering how much your school clothes sagged on you. Your clothes soon stopped being a problem as some programming the the clothes made them shrink into the female version of the school uniform complete with a skirt instead of pants and a ribbon instead of a tie. <br />
Your 8 year old little sister yawning and coming downstairs saw you and asked &quot;Your still a swapper? why not get a boyfriend May?&quot; <br />
your face was flushed red after this change and you said &quot;Cana... I&#39;ll get in a relationship when I feel like it, and being a swapper isn&#39;t good for starting relationships.&quot; You stabbed small bits of your eggs and ate them one small bite at a time. <br />
Your mother said &quot;I like you better as  a girl May, let&#39;s hope this time it sticks.&quot; <br />
personally you had hoped your switching gender had stopped. It had been 2 years since your change to a guy and it seemed to have stopped. With puberty starting during that time you had really hoped that you wouldn&#39;t have to switch, but at least now you had an idea what your female form would look like when it had matured a little. You had finished your eggs and said &quot;I&#39;ll be off to school then.&quot; <br />
<br />
Escaping your apartment and walking to your school you wished you knew at least the source of all these changes. That you could at least know why the ratio was governed the way it was.  Then you heard a small voice say &quot;Permission granted, Welcome returnee for the 194th time. What can I do for you this time?&quot;<br />
wondering you asked in your computer command silent voice &quot;What are you?&quot;<br />
the voice said &quot;I am the human regulation system, Whenever there is a disturbance in a ratio of gender, genetics, or anything bad i will fix it for the benefit of society continuing. You have been trusted after being in the system countless times for the benefit of society. Just connect here anytime you want something.&quot; <br />
You had really wondered what that meant, but after walking for a few minutes you were at your school and took your seat a back row. Despite not having changed in two years you had been labeled as a swapper so not a whole lot of people wanted to make strong relationships with you. swappers tend to have bad lasting relationships, because whenever they change gender or whatever a large part of themselves change as well. This of course tends to complicate said relationship which can end in hardship. At the very least you had two friends, Tony and Sara, and they had quickly noticed that there was some random girl where their friend used to be. <br />
The large strong and sporty Tony came to you and said &quot;Eh Miss, I think your in the wrong class.&quot; <br />
The more extroverted and more busty Sara said &quot;do you need help finding your class?&quot; <br />
You sighed as you remembered you had only made friends with them 1 and a half years ago, and while they knew you had a history of changing they never actually saw you as a girl. You explained &quot;I&#39;m Ma... Mike. There was a bomb at a woman&#39;s dorm and I was one of the replacements. I&#39;m thankful that these uniforms can change to fit any body type.&quot; <br />
Sara looked you over with somewhat of a stoic glare and then lightened her face and smiled.  She said &quot;I know a cute place to get you some clothes. I know you probably don&#39;t have the clothes to fit your female body right now. especially around this area.&quot; she pushed her breasts up a little and chuckled a bit. <br />
Tony sighed and said &quot;As long as your fine I think i&#39;m going to sit this one out. I&#39;m not really interested in going to a store that sells only girl clothes or underwear.&quot; <br />
After they went to their desks you looked around the class and had seen that a lot of the class had given you a little stare. Whenever you changed with a class you always got that stare. As if you somehow changed into an alien or was a spy from one gender to another. You wished that all the people that had glared at you could understand your problem. As class started you silently opened your computer and went back to that human regulation system.<br />
&quot;Hello returnee, what can I do for you?&quot; <br />
you said...</p>
