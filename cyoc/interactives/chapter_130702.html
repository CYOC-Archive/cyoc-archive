<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared believed his life sucked. On top of living in the faggiest dorm on campus, he also had to live with the worst possible roommate. Lucas had no respect for Jared and it showed. He never wore any clothing despite Jared&#39;s constant protests and many times started fucking his boyfriend blatantly and loudly in front of Jared, even while Jared was trying to study. Simply because Lucas was incredibly smart, the bisexual man took it upon himself to be as much of a dick about it as possible. Sometimes, it even felt like Lucas started doing faggy shit on purpose, Jared believed, as if the man was timing it (he often was). Jared hated the fact that his roommate made it a point to be as gay as possible and couldn&#39;t wait for the year to be over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously Lucas? In front of the fucking door?!&quot; Jared yelled, already exhausted from his football practice. Being the star quarterback on the college&#39;s football team should&#39;ve been impossible for a sophomore, but his performance on the field proved he deserved it. He was NFL worthy, and many loved him for it. Of course he had no problem joining a frat as a result. The brothers treated him with respect. In fact, understanding the university&#39;s terrible random roommate policy and being just as homophobic as Jared meant that they often gladly helped the handsome football player out, housing him if the man didn&#39;t want to deal with the disgusting &quot;lifestyle&quot; of his roommate. Jared just had to deal with a few more months until he&#39;d be free of this gay shit and could move into the frat house, he thought.<br />
<br />
Lucas, however, had different plans for his hot roommate. The man had been a pain his back in all the past realities that Lucas remembered. In this one, he constantly got on Lucas&#39; nerves by asking him to stop his sexual pursuits with other members of the dorm. It wasn&#39;t like Lucas was going after Jared. The tall, buff man wasn&#39;t his type, so why did he care who Lucas messed with? Sure, it was Jared&#39;s room too, but Lucas had needs that he sometimes just couldn&#39;t ignore.<br />
<br />
Well, now Jared would be there to help out those needs too, he mused. &quot;Sorry, Jared. Taylor wanted another dose, and who am I to refuse?&quot; Lucas explained. Jared silently fumed at the man&#39;s reasoning. He knew all too well that his RA wouldn&#39;t help him in this situation. He was probably the faggiest of them all! Even though Jared knew the fag dorm&#39;s shitty policies, that didn&#39;t mean he had to abide by them. He was straight after all, so they should&#39;ve respected that. Alas, Taylor always disregarded Jared&#39;s reasoning and pleas, explaining that policy stated that all residents had to be allowed to fuck whenever and wherever they wanted. Jared especially hated that Taylor followed that rule emphatically. Hell, he&#39;d rarely seen the guy without a cock or a dildo in one of his holes. It disgusted Jared, and he was ready to snap as he ran a hand through his jet black hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for fuck&#39;s sake, just let me through then you fags!&quot; he yelled. Jared wasn&#39;t having a good day to begin with. He&#39;d definitely failed his calculus midterm and his other classes weren&#39;t fairing much better. If it wasn&#39;t for his amazing athletic performance, the university probably would&#39;ve kicked him out by now. He certainly didn&#39;t want to deal with this nonsense.<br />
<br />
As Jared tried to inch past threesome, Lucas intervened. &quot;What are you doing Jared? You know you have to take a lick of my cock and fondle my balls before entering. Isn&#39;t that right, Taylor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor momentarily stopped licking the boyfriends&#39; coupling. &quot;Yeah Jared. If you don&#39;t do that I&#39;m going to have to write you up,&quot; Taylor said as he resumed ministrations. Jared grumbled as he knelt in front of his roommate and next to his RA and he began to move his mouth towards Lucas&#39; cock. He hated this dorm&#39;s policies, he thought once again.<br />
<br />
Lucas continued. &quot;Why the long face Jared? This is always your favorite part of the day. You told me that yourself,&quot; Lucas explained. Jared suddenly became much more eager to &quot;greet&quot; his roommate. Jared was still straight as they came but somehow he enjoyed this policy the dorm had made. Originally, he was disgusted by the idea, but he soon grew to love it as he often told his roommate. His green eyes quickly zeroed in on his prize for his long day&#39;s efforts as he took a greedy lick of Lucas&#39; cock, making sure to not touch Derek&#39;s asshole. He only liked licking and fondling his roommate and didn&#39;t want anything to do with these other guys as he pushed Taylor out of the way, causing the twinky RA to pout in anger.<br />
<br />
Lucas, noticing the &quot;fight&quot; quickly quelled the issue. &quot;Now, Jared, you know that&#39;s not nice,&quot; he admonished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t give a fuck!&quot; Jared explained. &quot;And who the hell are you to speak to me like that?!&quot; All Jared wanted was Lucas&#39; cock, he didn&#39;t need this shit.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s very rude Jared. I don&#39;t appreciate that,&quot; Lucas stated, frowning. The dumb jock certainly didn&#39;t have a right to speak to him that way. &quot;You need to be punished for that. Taylor, you know the policy. If Jared wants to be so rude, then he needs to be spanked on his bare ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shit, Jared thought. Now he&#39;d done it. He didn&#39;t want to get spanked, he was an adult! However, that didn&#39;t change that he didn&#39;t have a choice. If he didn&#39;t accept the spanking, he&#39;d be probably punished even more and with his academic standing, he certainly didn&#39;t need anything else against him.<br />
<br />
As Taylor excitedly got in position to spank Jared, who&#39;d raised his buttocks and lowered his jeans to his accept his punishment, Lucas continued speaking. &quot;You won&#39;t realize this Jared but every spank will rewrite your history to make you more submissive and raise your average level of arousal. This will be your only spanking out of punishment because you&#39;ll realize from this that you love getting spanked. It&#39;ll feel amazing to you, which is why from now on you&#39;ll only get it as a reward for behaving nice or slutty,&quot; Lucas explained, slamming harder into Derek as his own arousal grew. Changing people was so hot, he realized as he caused Derek to moan uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
As Jared preemptively winced from seeing Taylor prepare himself, he mentally reiterated and repeated how much he hated this dorm right up until Taylor&#39;s hand touched his butt cheek.<br />
<br />
SLAP!<br />
<br />
The sound would be something Jared would never forget as it changed who Jared was as a person. Usually, given his handsomeness and athletic achievements, he was the one doing the spanking and the multitude of girls he&#39;d slept with never complained. They&#39;d definitely never asked to reciprocate his actions. Now, he thought he knew why.<br />
<br />
SLAP! SLAP!<br />
<br />
Jared couldn&#39;t believe it. That felt amazing! And it was a guy who was doing it to him! Even though Jared was still straight as an arrow, he had to admit that if it always felt like this, he&#39;d probably be okay this happening more often. Even if it was one of the fags in his dorm, this felt too good to pass up, he thought his 9&quot; cock quickly hardened. Maybe he&#39;d even do a little more if they asked nicely.<br />
<br />
Wait, where had that thought come from, he thought, shocked at his own psyche. He didn&#39;t have time to process the slightly gay thought as Taylor&#39;s next set of spanks came around.<br />
<br />
SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!<br />
<br />
Of course he&#39;d do more if they asked, Jared realized. He was too submissive to disagree. Jared blushed as he thought back to all the times he&#39;d passed by other dorm members in the hall or bathroom and vividly recalled all the times they&#39;d ask him to do something clearly gay for them. He&#39;d always sheepishly agree, much to their joy. The worst part was that the others in his dorm now thought that Jared was gay too since he came too often from their actions. He couldn&#39;t help it, he was just so horny so often. It was starting to have an effect on his ability to play as he&#39;d often have to excuse himself to go to the bathroom to take care of himself. The coach probably only kept him on because he was such a great wide receiver, Jared thought as memories of being the quarterback disappeared from memory. He couldn&#39;t possibly be in such a leadership position. The main reason why he could be a great wide receiver is that the job mostly consisted of doing what he was told, and he could definitely do that. In fact, this change actually helped him out academically. To do well in his classes, all he had to do was obey his teachers, which was easy for him. This made Jared much more studious as a result, not that he was complaining. If he kept this balance, he&#39;d be an incredible hunk and an incredible academic.<br />
<br />
As Taylor continued smacking Jared&#39;s ass, much to both of their pleasures, Lucas formulated the rest of his plan. &quot;Taylor, that&#39;s enough. Get back to licking up our cum. Derek just gave you a new load on my chest so come get it. Jared stand up and come here.&quot; Both boys did as they were told as Jared faced his roommate.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, have you learned your lesson Jared?&quot; Lucas politely asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Jared responded. He didn&#39;t know why he called everyone sir, it just felt right. He knew it gave the gay guys in his dorm the wrong impression, but even though he hated gay people, he couldn&#39;t find it in himself to disobey them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. Now take off those disgusting clothes. As you do, you&#39;ll realize how much you hate wearing clothes in general, and you&#39;re happy that we&#39;re all comfortable with being nude in this dorm. In fact, you&#39;ll realize just how much you love wearing as little as possible, and it shows in your clothing style,&quot; Lucas explained. As Jared reluctantly stripped off his shirt, he began relaxing and getting more comfortable with showing himself off. As he dropped his shirt, it disappeared from existence, as did most of the shirts in his room. After all, he definitely didn&#39;t need them when he went to football practice; most of the guys were just impressed by his rock hard, hairy abs. After he&#39;d kicked off his sneakers and socks that transformed into sandals as they hit the ground, he removed his belt, wiping it out of existence. As he removed his jeans, they shrunk as they went down his legs, and by the time he&#39;d removed them, they were simply a pair of booty shorts, as were all his jeans and cargo shorts in his closet. Jared now gladly dropped the shorts as he stood in front of the trio completely nude as he now always went commando. Besides, he felt more free when he wore less. He was thankful that his RA and his roommate were so cool with it. He might&#39;ve hated gays, but this was one thing Jared could get behind.<br />
<br />
Lucas smiled as spoke the final words to seal Jared fate. &quot;Good boy! You&#39;re very horny now, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Lucas asked. Reality didn&#39;t need to change this time as it was already true. Jared was quite the exhibitionist now, so of course he was hard and ready the moment his booty shorts had dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; Jared stated emphatically, nodding his head in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, start taking care of it then! Remember that as you do, every stroke of your cock makes you more and more of a twink physically. When you cum, which you do often and can do numerous times, you&#39;ll become more of a twink mentally and emotionally. In your case, when your transformation is complete, you&#39;ll be a perfect, cute, nerdy and slutty twink,&quot; Lucas explained. While he knew it would&#39;ve been hot to have Jared become a dumb slut like Taylor and Derek, he also knew that he wanted at least one the three of them to have half a brain for the off chance that he wasn&#39;t fucking them.<br />
<br />
To Jared, however, this sounded like a death sentence. He&#39;d heard Lucas call his boyfriend a twink numerous times during their fuck sessions, so he had an idea of what a twink was and he certainly didn&#39;t want to become one. Unfortunately for him, he was still incredibly submissive, so he felt an uncontrollable need to start jacking himself off, much to his horror. It was like two sides of himself were warring with each other as the submissive, horny side began slowly stroking his 9-incher while his jock, homophobic side wanted out as he steadied himself on the wall.<br />
<br />
Lucas, seeing the struggle, decided to tip the scales even more. &quot;One more thing: any of us touching you drives you crazy with lust,&quot; he stated as he grazed a hand on Jared, causing the brute jock to moan with desire. He involuntarily began pumping his shrinking rod much harder as his coating of dark hair vanished from his body. Taylor and Derek, who shared scooping up Derek&#39;s load, both realized quickly what Lucas had said. Eager to get more cum, the twinks practically jumped on Jared. As Taylor began sucking the jock&#39;s balls and Derek started making out with Jared, the hairless brute couldn&#39;t control himself as he released his first load. Instantly, memories of bedding tons of girls vanished from his mind as he began losing interest in women. As it was, he was bisexual, and most girls didn&#39;t appreciate his submissive nature or his effeminate voice. This quickly led to him experimenting with guys a lot more to satisfy his need. After all, they were much more willing to top the formerly 6&#39;, now 5&#39;6&quot; man. It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t get girls, it was just that he couldn&#39;t possibly get enough with his often giggly and slightly effeminate nature. Even though he acted like it, it wasn&#39;t even that he was dumb. It was quite the opposite: he was good with academics. It was just that he often sounded flighty and flamboyant at times and that, he quickly found out, was a turn off for women.<br />
<br />
Since Lucas made him aware of the fact that he was changing, Jared began panicking even more as he questioned whether these memories were really even his. He was going through a hurricane of emotions: fear, lust, anger, confusion. He couldn&#39;t stop pumping himself no matter how much he wanted to. It was driving him crazy. The other boys all redoubled their efforts after noticing Jared&#39;s diminished struggle, with Lucas now helping by twisting Jared&#39;s nipples with one hand as he got behind Jared and held him in place with his other. The jock, who could barely be called such due his rapidly shrinking muscles, began lightly grinding against Lucas&#39; groin, unable to help himself. It was just too much as another orgasm washed over him and spurted out of his now 4&quot; cock.<br />
<br />
All memories of his sexual interactions with girls popped out of his head as he realized from a young age that he was definitely gay. With his effeminate voice and gay mannerisms, there was no way anyone could have a doubt. As all knowledge of sports in general disappeared from his brain, memories of getting bullied as a child appeared in his head. It led to him spending much more time on his studies, since the closer he was to his teachers, the less his bullies could make him do. His bullies quickly realized just how submissive the boy was and often took advantage of it, forcing him to do very embarrassing stuff for their amusement. Being gay certainly didn&#39;t help the situation. If it wasn&#39;t for his incredible academic standing, he didn&#39;t know what would&#39;ve happened. Now, he enjoyed studies, enjoyed ogling at guys and was disgusted by sports (except for the jocks in them) and girls.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, the intellectual in Jared still realized that this was wrong as he continued struggling against the boys. Sure, he&#39;d gotten limited action with other guys and this was about the hottest thing that happened to him but he couldn&#39;t be sure if this was how he really felt. Even though he&#39;d stopped steadying himself on the wall, choosing instead to use Lucas as support, he wasn&#39;t sure if he&#39;d wanted this. Lucas, now annoyed at Jared&#39;s resolve, ended this quickly. &quot;Jared, even feeling something hard up against your boyhole makes you much more slutty as a result. Having a cock enter you makes you vastly more slutty,&quot; Lucas explained as he began rubbing his spit and precum along his cock while fingering the former jock. Jared&#39;s masturbation was having its final effects. His muscles now completely gone, the twink&#39;s hair became fabulously styled and had streaks of green in it to match his vibrant eyes. His features became cute and innocent and his mind did the opposite. He no longer got limited action with other guys. Once he&#39;d turned 18 he&#39;d quickly realized that, while he was gay, he was incredibly sexy. He learned that he could get his bullies to order him around in a much more fun way if he simply worked his technique on them. Being incredibly smart meant that he&#39;d learned quickly how to pick up techniques. Soon, they were no longer bullying him, realizing that there was much more to be obtained from enjoying Jared&#39;s incredible skills.<br />
<br />
It was when Lucas finally entered the new twink&#39;s incredible bubble butt that Jared finally turned, having a third orgasm that cemented his identity. Yeah, he was gay, he thought, and nearly everyone he met knew it nowadays. He was psyched to find out that he had been placed in the hot, gay dorm this year and celebrated with an orgy with the bullies from his high school, most of whom were questioning their own sexualities as a result of Jared incredible skills in bed. Being the top of his class in high school meant that he had inherited Taylor&#39;s former scholarship, but being the bottom of his class meant that his college experience was a fun one. Hell, he&#39;d even managed to convince some frat members to take a crack at his crack. They&#39;d never invite him to become a frat brother now, but Jared couldn&#39;t care less. The upper floors of the gay dorm were for upperclassmen who&#39;d chosen to live there and Jared would be sure to move up there next year. Perhaps Lucas and his boyfriend would join him, he thought, as he happily grinded into Lucas&#39; pelvis, letting his roommate&#39;s cock drive deeper into him. He let out a slutty moan as the new Jared was born. The black and green haired, perfect twink loved books just as much as he loved cock and he found he was able to learn best when he had something in one of his holes, he thought with a smirk. So what if he had been changed feel this way? This life was great, and he was going to be sure to enjoy it, he realized as he enthusiastically and full-heartedly joined the orgy.</p>
