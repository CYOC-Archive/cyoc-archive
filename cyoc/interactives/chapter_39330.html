<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your mind clears and you think about the dream you just had. You can't quite remember it but you know that it was strange. You look around and see pink walls with balloons. The sheets on the bed are a pastel pink and you seem to be wearing pink pajamas. The bed is strange looking with metal bars on the side. There's something stuck in your arm with a tube sticking out and leading to a bag hanging from a metal hook.<br />
<br />
Someone comes into the room and says &quot;Our little patient is awake. That's good. You gave us a good scare there young lady. My name is Dr. Jones. Can you tell me your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to remember your name but you can't. You look at Dr. Jones and say with tears in your eyes &quot;I don't remember it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok&quot; Dr. Jones said. &quot;I'm sure you'll remember it. For now we'll call you Lisa. How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
When Dr. Jones said Lisa you remember that that's your name and you say &quot;That's my name!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's good&quot; Dr. Jones said. &quot;Do you remember your last name or where you live?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you said with tears in your eyes because you didn't remember. &quot;Where's my mommy? I want my mommy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't know who your mommy is&quot; Dr. Jones said. &quot;We didn't know your name until you told me. We still don't know your last name. Hopefully the police can find your mommy and daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone else entered the room and spoke quietly to Dr. Jones. You take the chance to look around the room again and see another girl in the bed next to you. The person finished speaking to Dr. Jones and left.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jones had a sad look on his face as he said &quot;I'm sorry Lisa. The police have been unable to find your mommy and daddy. A woman will be here in the morning to take you to a place where little girls like you can get a new mommy and daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I WANT MY MOMMY!&quot; you shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know your mommy's name?&quot; Dr. Jones asked. &quot;The police might be able to track her down if they have a name.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think about it and almost have your mommy's name but you lose it. You start crying and wail &quot;I DON'T KNOW MY MOMMY'S NAME!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok Lisa&quot; Dr. Jones said. &quot;You were really sick. We thought that you wouldn't wake up for awhile. You had a high fever when you were found. It's only natural that you would forget things.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl in the next bed stirred and sat up. She looked around and noticed you and Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones looked at her and said &quot;I see our other little patient is awake now too.&quot; He then proceeded to ask her the same questions he asked you. At first she couldn't remember her name but she suddenly did when he said that he'd call her Emily. This bothered you for some reason but you didn't know why. (You don't know it but Emily was Dr. Thurdoe.)<br />
<br />
After some crying from both you and Emily a young woman came in and Dr. Jones spoke quietly to her. After that they both left but the woman came back soon with a couple pairs of panties and some baby wipes. &quot;Ok, my name is Molly and I'm a nurse&quot; she said. &quot;First thing we're going to do is get those IVs out of you. Now I need you to hold still while I do this. Can you both be good girls and do that for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I'll get your's out first Lisa&quot; Molly said. She closed some clips along the tube then broke it near your hand. She looped the tube that wasn't on you over the other metal hook. She then gently pulled off the tape on your hand and wrist. She then slowly slid out the needle that was in your hand. She put a piece of cotton on the spot where the needle was and asked you to hold it there while she got a bandage for you. You did and she placed a pink bandage with Disney Princesses on your hand after removing the cotton. She then did the same thing with Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok now to get you girls out of those diapers&quot; Molly said. &quot;Since I'm already over here I'll do you first Emily.&quot; She pulled down the blankets and her pajama bottoms. She took off Emily's diaper and wiped her with the baby wipes. She then put a pair of panties on her and put the pajama bottoms back on her. Finally she covered Emily back up and it was your turn. Molly did the same thing to you and you could see that you had pooped in the diaper and probably peed in it too. You hadn't noticed that you had done that. You didn't even notice that you were wearing a diaper.<br />
<br />
Molly finished and said &quot;You two were very good girls. Now I bet you two are hungry. I'll be right back with dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly left and you two look at each other. Both of you had the same problem, neither of you could remember much except your first names. This bothers you again but you don't know why. Emily had brown hair as long as yours and green eyes. She seemed to be as tall as you too.<br />
<br />
Molly came back in with two trays of food and you realize that you're really hungry. She helps both of you sit up so you could eat. She placed the trays on little tables and took off the covers. &quot;Ok we have chicken nuggets, corn, apple sauce, and milk&quot; she said. &quot;Now eat all of your dinner and you'll get jello for desert.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were so hungry that you would have eaten all of your dinner even if there was no desert. You dig in and soon you had eaten every last bite of your dinner. You look over and notice that Emily had also finished her dinner. Molly came back in a few minutes later and said &quot;Well you girls must have been hungry. Do you have room for jello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya!&quot; you and Emily say at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I'll go get it&quot; Molly said as she took the empty trays and left. In a few moments she was back with two dishes of jello. &quot;Here you girls go. Two lime jellos. One for each of you. Enjoy.&quot; She left again and both of you eat your jello.<br />
<br />
As soon as both of you were done eating your jello Molly came back in and took the dishes out. She didn't say anything this time and she seemed sad. Dr. Jones came in just as Molly left and said &quot;I'll explain what will happen tomorrow. A couple people from a place for abandoned kids will come and take you to a place to get new mommies and daddies for you. One of the ladies will have clothes for you and will help you get dressed. She will then take you to your temporary home until new mommies and daddies can be found for you. Now it looks like you two are tired so go to sleep. If you need to go potty sometime during the night the toilet is right here.&quot; He pointed to a door and left.<br />
<br />
You lay there drifting off to sleep when Emily asked &quot;Do you remember your mommy and daddy Lisa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uh&quot; you said. &quot;Do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uh&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
As you drift off to sleep you have the feeling that somethings wrong.<br />
<br />
In the morning you're gently awaken by Molly and she tells you that a Miss Tamthiss would be coming in to help them dress and that you'd get to keep the pajamas. The other lady is a Miss Faye. Molly left with a sad look on her face and both you and Emily use the potty.<br />
<br />
A woman came in carrying two dresses and shoes. She said she was Miss Tamthiss and she started helping both of you dress. As it turned out the dresses were the same as were the shoes and stockings. She gave you the option of having a ribbon in your hair which both of you said yes to. She then took you to a car and put both of you in booster seats.<br />
<br />
After a long ride, during which both you and Emily fell asleep again, Miss Tamthiss and Miss Faye took you into the building and to your room. It had two beds and some toys. You were then taken down to a big playroom. There were other kids there and you two quickly begin playing with them.<br />
<br />
You played until lunch and then took a nap. After you went back down to the playroom and played some more. After an hour or two Miss Tamthiss came in and told you and Emily to come with her. She took you into a room where there was a man and a woman. &quot;Emily, Lisa, this is Mr. and Mrs. Ford&quot; Miss Tamthiss said. &quot;They want to adopt you. Do you think you'd like to go with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at them and can't help but think they're nice people so you say &quot;Ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily also says &quot;Ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Miss Tamthiss said. &quot;Just a little paper work left and then you two can go to your new home. Shouldn't take more than five minutes.&quot;</p>
