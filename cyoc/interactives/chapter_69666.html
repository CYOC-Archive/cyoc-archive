<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day when David woke up, he didn’t feel as bad as before. So he sucked off another guy – lots of guys <br />
experiment at some point. It’d probably come to nothing but David just chalked it up to one of life’s strange <br />
experiences, at least with a bit more reassurance he was straight. Except that while he’d been thinking about <br />
the experience he’d got a hard-on.<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” David exclaimed, he was so hard it hurt. He beat off furiously, so hard that when he came it arced <br />
over his head and into the bedstead. In his exhaustion, he suddenly noticed that his dick felt a bit bigger. <br />
He was puzzled by this, grown men’s dicks didn’t just grow, did they? He got out a ruler, and sure enough he <br />
was nearer 8 inches long now. Not that he was complaining, David actually felt quite smug, until he realised <br />
in his post-orgasmic stupor that this could have been to do with Tony’s promise.<br />
<br />
He suddenly remembered the business card, which just had a website address on it. David grabbed his laptop and <br />
went to the page, which said:<br />
<br />
‘To a man in need,<br />
<br />
By now you’re experiencing the first signs of the change: your dick should have grown about an inch overnight, <br />
and there’s more to come! There are more changes in store over the next few weeks, but most are variable: some <br />
will get more muscular, some fatter, some taller, some shorter, some hairier, some smoother, some will change <br />
race, and there’s probably a load of other possibilities. I haven’t had someone go through the change in the -<br />
same way as someone else yet. I probably never will.<br />
<br />
But there’re two things you WILL experience, and I’m sorry, but they’re part and parcel of the whole. First, <br />
if you’re not already, you’re going to turn gay. You’ll probably fight it at first, but it’s inevitable. It <br />
might be the first change, it might be the last, but it will come.<br />
<br />
Also, once your change is over, you’ll know because you’ll feel the need to change other men into one of us. <br />
The urge to do this will be stronger than eating or drinking, it’ll be a primal urge, and like other primal <br />
urges you’ll know instinctively how to do it. One change will keep you going for about a month, but after that <br />
you’ll need to change someone else.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but enjoy your new life,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Matthias Coren<br />
<br />
CEO, The New Man Initiative<br />
<br />
PS: fight the ocean and you will drown. Accept that this is who you are now, and everything will be easier’<br />
<br />
David was in shock. He wished he’d never even given Tony the time of day now. But from reading the website if <br />
he hadn’t willingly sucked Tony off he probably would have forced himself on him. He didn’t want to be gay, or <br />
make other guys this way – it wasn’t his place. He turned off the computer and tried to clear his head. Over <br />
the next few days he did his normal routine: he went to work and was glad of busy shifts to occupy himself; he <br />
watched crap on TV, anything to keep him busy. He also decided to send a text to all his friends:<br />
<br />
‘Sry guys, im sick so cant come out, will let u all no when im better, David’<br />
<br />
He could worry about what to tell them later.<br />
<br />
David was hopeful though: maybe he’d only imagined his dick being bigger. And maybe he’d subconsciously slid <br />
the ruler further along his shaft to give a false reading, after all what guy didn’t want to have a bigger <br />
dick? No, he reassured himself: of course it wasn’t real. He distracted himself by sitting down with a <br />
crossword: something else his friends made fun of him for (the crosswords would prompt them to call him either <br />
boring or old), but David liked to keep his brain in check. Since leaving college he didn’t have much in the <br />
way of mental stimulation so he’d taken up crosswords to keep his gray matter working. Quickly he lost himself <br />
in the puzzle and forgot about his situation.<br />
<br />
But the further he got through the week the less able he was to distract himself from his crotch. He found <br />
himself getting hard much more often than usual – by the end of the week he swore we was spending half his <br />
waking life with a stiffy. Trapping it in his boxers was also becoming much more uncomfortable than normal: it <br />
was torture. While before when David got home from work he would lounge around the apartment in sweats, now he <br />
would shuck his boxers and freeball. He knew this wasn’t like him at all, but he tried to pretend that maybe <br />
all this time without a girlfriend was getting to him more than normal.<br />
<br />
David was able to pretend all that week, right up until Friday. He woke up groggily from a deep sleep, and saw <br />
the time on the clock. It took longer than usual for the numbers to come together as an actual time in his <br />
head, there was a one, a three, a two and a one...what did that mean again? Finally his mind snapped back to <br />
reality as he realised it was 21 minutes past 1pm, and that he was late for work by over an hour.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” David shouted as he jumped out of bed, rummaging through piles of clothes on his floor for a clean <br />
uniform. He grabbed the pants and yanked those on (no time for boxers today he told himself, just tucking his <br />
hard dick under the waistline), and looked frantically for a shirt. Finally he found one, and tugged it over <br />
his left arm. As he turned to pull it onto his right, he heard an unexpected sound – rrrriiipppppppp.<br />
<br />
“Oh God what was that?” David thought, “This shirt’s brand new, how has it ripped already?”<br />
<br />
He threw it off, searching for another one, which he found at the bottom of another pile of clothes. This one <br />
was a bit crumpled, and could really have done with an iron, but David had no time so again threw it on, and <br />
again, heard the ripping sound.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” David shouted, “These fucking shirts, I’m gonna-“<br />
<br />
But that was when David saw why the shirts had ripped. He’d been in such a blind rush before he hadn’t <br />
noticed. But poking through the hole in the second shirt was a firm, round bicep. David didn’t believe it at <br />
first: he was almost afraid to touch it, as though it might disappear if he did. But he gingerly put the <br />
fingers of his other hand to it, and felt it flex under his smooth skin.<br />
<br />
“Fuck.....” David was in complete shock. There was no use pretending the New Man Initiative was a joke or a <br />
trick any more. This meant his dick probably had grown after all too. He smiled a little as he realised this, <br />
and suddenly his search for his uniforms lost all urgency. He reached for his cellphone and called his <br />
supervisor.<br />
<br />
“Hello Mrs Somers? It’s David.”<br />
<br />
“David, where the hell have you been? Do you know you’re an hour and a half late for your shift? We’ve been <br />
rammed today as well, it’s been the busiest lunch shift in a long time. You’d better have a good reason!”<br />
<br />
“I know Mrs Somers, I’m sorry. I’ve been really sick, I slept straight through my alarm and only just woke up <br />
now.”<br />
<br />
“Hmmm. Well, I guess I can’t really blame you for that. Alright David, get well soon. Get a doctor’s note, and <br />
let me know when you’ll be back in.” *click*<br />
<br />
“Bitch,” David said. That felt good, he thought, as he smiled and surveyed his room. He never bunked off work, <br />
and figured this was a pretty good day to do it. Actually, thought David, normally he would have gone in <br />
anyway. The shirt would have been a problem, but if he stopped off at Pal-Mart or something on the way he <br />
could have got a bigger size. David may not have liked his job, but he still took pride in doing it well and <br />
being a good employee. He wasn’t sure what had made him stay home today...<br />
<br />
David shrugged, and walked over to the bathroom to survey his new body in the mirror. He flexed his biceps <br />
first, giving a big, bold double bi. Fuck he was stunning. His arms, formerly 12 or 13 inchers, had shot in a <br />
week up to 15 or 16 at least, and his shoulders had broadened to accommodate them and his new pecs – bulging <br />
out slightly over his stomach, now ever so slightly ridged. He still had the pants on, and grinned cockily as <br />
he saw how much they hugged his muscular ass. He dropped them though, letting his dick bounce free as he <br />
sighed with relief, and surveyed his more muscular legs. After a few poses, he decided to measure his prick <br />
again, wandering out of the bathroom to find the ruler. Where had he left that again? Oh yes, on the bedside <br />
table. He brought it back into the bathroom, planted it at the base of his dick in the middle of his pubes <br />
and....fuck.<br />
<br />
9 and a half inches.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me!” David said – he was pretty big before but this was something else. He decided to get some string <br />
and measure his girth, which came out at about 6 inches – not as impressive but he’d always had a bit of a <br />
pencil dick.<br />
<br />
After trying more poses and admiring his new muscular body, David realised he had no idea how much time had <br />
passed. He glanced out the window and saw it was dark. David wandered out and checked the time.<br />
<br />
“Fuck! How the fuck did it get to after 8pm?!” David was confused, surely he hadn’t been admiring his body for 6 and a half hours? But again he shrugged it off, instead putting on the loosest clothes he had so he could go <br />
to Pal-Mart to get some baggier shirts and pants – much as he liked how the ones he had now hugged his ass, if <br />
he got much bigger he wouldn’t be able to wear those either. And that got him thinking: what was going to <br />
happen for the next few weeks? Maybe the first week would be muscle and dick growth, the week after something <br />
else and so on for the rest of the month? I hope so, I like the size I am now, thought David as he squeezed <br />
one of his biceps and grinned.</p>
