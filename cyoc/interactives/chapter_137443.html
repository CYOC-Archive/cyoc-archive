<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This took a while to write but i am thinking that she would want to be a Milkpire hybrid with a drider with a hyper thorax.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Crystal looked around for the book. She smiled as she picked it up. “I’m going to use this for a minute,” She smiled as she held a pen in her hand.<br />
<br />
“Wait what are you going to do?” Josh asked a bit worried.<br />
<br />
She instantly started to write into the book. “Bond us. EXACTLY as I want.”<br />
<br />
Josh’s eyes went wide. He got up to try to grab it from her hands. Went he lunged at he sideways. She jumped and landed on top of his breasts balls. With a great landing she sent a huge smack through the ball. He blushed as he felt her used her feet to rub them. Making the milk stir. “Crystal, can you please give me the book back?” He asked worried.<br />
<br />
“No.” Her cold words made him feel a chill going down his spine. “With this I can actually make our bond the way that I want it to be.” She said and then started to write.<br />
<br />
<em>Crystal and Josh are bonded blood (breast milk) mates on the highest of level vampires bond ritual. This one bonds them in two ways, both as mates, lovers and Master (Josh) and slave/servant (Crystal).<br />
Crystal refers to Josh as her mate, lover or boyfriend depending on who she is talking to. When talking to Josh she calls him darling, honey, sweetie or master. She calls him Darling, honey, sweetie in public and Master in private. The names that she calls him in public can be changed and added to by Josh’s command.<br />
<br />
When talking to other about Josh she will call him Josh, darling, honey. Even calling him her ‘Boyfriend’ to others.<br />
<br />
Crystal is completely in love with Josh and cannot love anyone else. She will let him get more wives. But she will always be his main wife.<br />
Josh will always love Crystal with the strongest of love, but he can still full for another girl. OR make them fall for him.<br />
<br />
This Breast Milk Mate Bond is not able to be broken by any means, including this book. Only slightly altered or added to.</em><br />
<br />
She smiled and watched the writing glow gold before turning black. She smiled and tossed the book and pen to the bed. She grinned and slipped off her shorts and panties and then re rest of her clothes. She slipped down his breast balls and spread her ass open to let his rock-hard dick slide into her clean anus. “Let it truly bond!~” She said.<br />
<br />
“Why what did you do?!” He then gasped as her tight anus held his dick in a vice gripe. But when her yoga ball belly slapped into his body he gasped. There was suddenly a huge pleasure that shot through his body. Milk shot out of his breasts balls up his dick. The cold silky milk shot up through Crystal’s body. She opened her mouth to let the milk shoot out of her mouth like a raging river.<br />
<br />
Then her breasts started to blast out breast milk like a raging river. But the torrents of milk from both of them flew through the air. Curving around like a flying water going through a water slide. Crystal’s milk bended and raced through the air and into his mouth. He had to open his mouth to let the milk in. Then the milk that shot out of Crystal’s mouth. His breast ball milk then flew down to mix with Crystal’s milk and went into his mouth. Both of their milk mixed and blended together as it ran through his body. In just a few seconds the milk shot out of his anus and then split and flew back up into Crystal’s pussy.<br />
<br />
All the while this happened, a breast milk colored crystal tattoos appeared on Josh’s breast balls. Focusing and starting around his nipples. All of the tattoos somehow looked like glass, so you could see his normal skin tone under the tattoos. And the same matching tattoos formed around Crystal’s neck.<br />
<br />
The milk continued to flow around for a while long before it all stopped. The two were left panting as the mixed breast ball milk and breast milk was absorbed into their bodies. “I am you are my Master.” Crystal said with a huge blushing moan. She kissed his lips while her vampire eyes looked deep into his eyes.<br />
<br />
<em>‘Master?!’</em> He thought as they entered a deep kiss. Love entered his mind. His wife and himself continued to kiss while Crystal rocked her anus around his cock. Once they released their locked lips. He panted. “What did you do to yourself?”<br />
<br />
Crystal was pretty stoic as she pulled her anus off of his dick. She stood tall next to him. She opened the book and handed it to him, so he could see what she wrote. “Nothing Darling. I Just wanted to be yours. Forever.” She watched him get pale as he read it. “I will be your wife and you are my husband. I do not care if you find another that you love. But I will never leave your side.” She hugged his right arm to smooth it in her boobs.<br />
<br />
“Crystal… why?” He stammered.<br />
<br />
“I just love you. Unconditionally.” Those words struck a cord in his body. “And this way no one can take me away from you.” She kissed his cheek.<br />
<br />
“You are insane… Crystal.” Josh was still shaking at this. <em>‘It’s not that bad to be honest. Only seems to bond us as lovers… mate…’</em> He blushed at the thoughts. “But… this is how you want to protect me?”<br />
<br />
Crystal nodded. “Yes. Master, it is how I will protect my darling.” At this point Josh noticed that the tattoos they had was gone.<br />
<br />
“This is going to be hard to get use to.” Josh closed the book. “I take it you want to live with me know too.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I would love to. But you should use the book, so I can.” She sat on the bed with her naked body. Her tits jiggled with their milk sloshing loudly.<br />
<br />
“I’ll add that in.” Josh looked down and sighed. Opening the book he wrote in. <em>Crystal lives with Josh, and will always sleep in the same room and bed. Unless there is a huge reason for them to be separate. This is completely normal and no one is able to force them apart.</em> The text flashed gold and he showed it to her. She smiled. <br />
<br />
“Darling. What else do you want to do? Are we going to fuck again? Go watch tv? Do you want me to tell you how the Vampire world works?” She started to ask as Josh took in what she was saying. “Or can we add more races to this world? Or can you grant my second wish to let me be a Milkpire hybrid with another race?”<br />
<br />
Josh had to stop and pause to think about it before he gave his answer.</p>
