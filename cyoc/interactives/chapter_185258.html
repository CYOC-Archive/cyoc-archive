<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That Friday, Ethan&#39;s school team was participating in a swim meet. Before they were due to leave, the coach gathered them round to introduce somebody. Ethan noticed that Jared, who normally just plain ignored him, gave him the evils before situating himself as far away as possible. He laughed to himself -- that douchebag Montgomery had been foiled by his kid brother, and something about that felt poetic to Ethan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright everybody, we have a transfer student joining us.&quot; The coach told them. &quot;He&#39;ll be starting in the top bracket, since he placed well at his previous school. I expect you all to treat him like one of us. So, introduce yourselves, and then get your things in order. Mr Sorensen, do a circuit and learn their names.&quot; He nudged the boy standing next to him, not a man to stand on ceremony nor theatrics, before turning to stride away to continue the meet prep.<br />
<br />
Ethan and Greg were the last in the circle for the greetings, and Ethan had been in a distracted mood for the morning. He was brought out of it by the new guy shaking Greg&#39;s hand, and then reaching for his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucas Sorensen.&quot; He was tall -- taller than Ethan, who was a good 5&#39;10. Not only that, but almost as muscular as Greg, who was the most built on the team, and about the limit of what was normal for a swimmer. With wavy red-blonde hair and soft sea-green eyes, Lucas had a friendly smile and an air of easy confidence. Ethan found himself smiling back while they maintained eye contact for what seemed like a little longer than necessary.<br />
<br />
Involuntarily, Ethan&#39;s heartbeat picked up, and for some reason he felt his mini penis twitch, buried beneath several layers of crotch stuffing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan Morales.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re the star of the team?&quot; His handshake was firm. &quot;I&#39;ve heard good things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Ethan nodded. &quot;Hope you feel at home here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I will. Nice meeting you Greg, Ethan.&quot; Lucas&#39; attention lingered for an extra moment before he was off, trailing after the rest of the team.<br />
<br />
The two guys watched him go, and then Greg turned to Ethan. &quot;I think I recognise him from Westfield High. Wasn&#39;t he their captain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so.&quot; Ethan agreed. &quot;What d&#39;you think of him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh.&quot; Greg shrugged like he didn&#39;t care, but Ethan knew his personality well enough to recognise the apparently unimpressed attitude as being something closer to daunted. Ethan wasn&#39;t sure whether it was because Lucas seemed naturally charismatic, or because he was handsome, but Greg was definitely intimidated. &quot;He&#39;s not bad, but seems a bit stuck up, like he&#39;s hot shit or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuck up? Ethan&#39;s impression was that Lucas seemed cool, maybe even a bit charming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; He smirked, and they began to follow after the others. &quot;I dunno, dude. You sound kinda threatened. If I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d think you were jealous!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jealous?!&quot; Greg&#39;s composure slipped, and he spluttered, giving a huffy answer. &quot;I&#39;m not- ... don&#39;t be stupid! Jealous of HIM? No way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan snickered as they went to get  ready for the meet.<br />
<br />
Greg was TOTALLY jealous.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
All the way to the swim meet, Greg couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Ethan&#39;s perceptive comment, and the more he thought about it, the more he didn&#39;t like it. Lucas seemed annoyingly perfect -- why did he and Ethan instantly get along and appear like they would easily become friends? It was bad enough being rivals with Ethan, he didn&#39;t need ANOTHER Mr Popular to complicate things.<br />
<br />
Maybe ... he could even the odds?<br />
<br />
Perhaps a prank to bring Ethan down to size was needed -- literally.<br />
<br />
Maybe if Ethan was embarrassed in front of some random strangers from another school, and had to explain why he had a little hairless dick instead of something more regular? Greg was sure Ethan had come to the meet with his underwear contents 99% padding and only 1% cock, and that Eric certainly had the ring.<br />
<br />
He put his hastily-conceived prank into action not long after they arrived. Following Ethan as they traversed through the meet&#39;s facilities, he &#39;accidentally&#39; bumped some students from a different school carrying hot food. As they were crossing paths, one of them spilled part of his lunch all over Ethan&#39;s uniform.<br />
<br />
The other students apologised, and though Ethan waved it off as nothing, he was still covered in bits of corn chip and nacho sauce.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap, I gotta go get clean.&quot; He told Greg. &quot;I&#39;m gonna hit the showers quick before the next lot use it, and join you guys soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Greg agreed, trying not to grin. &quot;See you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of following the others though, he trailed Ethan through to the empty changing rooms. Hanging back, he spied on Ethan and waited for him to strip off, and sure enough, there it was. Soft, it looked so delicate and childish, and there was a comical amount of unoccupied extra space around it, between Ethan&#39;s legs. Greg had to bite back his laughter as he watched Ethan walk to the shower, the little nub and tight orbs so easy to see against the smooth hairless groin. Ethan really did look very undeveloped, just like a kid, and for some reason -- Greg didn&#39;t even know why -- he couldn&#39;t help thinking it just suited him.<br />
<br />
As soon as Ethan was gone, he sneaked across and stole his rival&#39;s speedo from where it lay discarded on the bench. Stuffing it in a pocket, Greg walked back out. Some from another team would be in shortly, and Ethan would be stuck without anything to change into. It was perfect! Grinning to himself, he almost walked straight into Lucas coming the other way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Greg!&quot; Lucas shot him that same friendly smile, and Greg struggled not to pull a face. Why did he act so fucking COOL about everything? &quot;Have you seen Ethan? He didn&#39;t catch up with the rest of us, just wanted to make sure he was okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or, maybe this was better! Maybe he could just make this a super awkward encounter between Ethan and the new guy instead, and break up any chance of them being buddy-buddy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I think I did see him. He might have gone to the showers, maybe something&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without any urging, Lucas took the initiative, immediately making for the showers and Greg followed along with him, pretending to NOT be redoubling his steps back the exact same way he&#39;d just come.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should probably let you know though, as Ethan&#39;s friend,&quot; Greg told him as they walked, the duplicity in his voice well hidden, &quot;that he&#39;s kinda sensitive about ... the downstairs area. Always been a bit shy getting changed, you know what I mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Downstairs area?&quot; Lucas queried. He wasn&#39;t flustered, his demeanour basically unflappable. &quot;Why, is there a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; Greg stated with false concern, &quot;I guess he just isn&#39;t so secure in his masculinity, like the rest of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s weird.&quot; The other guy shrugged. &quot;He seemed normal when I met him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg snickered -- boy was THAT illusion about to be shattered ...<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
The shower was just a quick in-and-out for Ethan, and he didn&#39;t spend too long getting cleaned up. As tempting as it was to take a few seconds tickling and caressing the perfection of his tiny juvenile cock, he knew how addictive it felt. The nerves heightened his interest in playing with himself and made him want to try, but his better judgement knew he shouldn&#39;t waste too much time, because the others could soon be in, and his privacy would likely not last too long.<br />
<br />
Shower done, Ethan returned back to his spot.<br />
<br />
Strangely, his speedo wasn&#39;t there.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s odd,&quot; he thought to himself, his heart beginning to pound with anxiety, &quot;I could have sworn I left it here.&quot;<br />
<br />
But, as he looked back and forward along the benches, his concern began to turn into fear, and then into panic. It was gone -- and he was naked, and shrunken, in another school&#39;s changing rooms! Frantic, his search intensified and he visually swept every surface -- until he heard a sound from the entrance.<br />
<br />
Voices! One of them he immediately recognised as Greg, but with fresh added horror he soon identified the other as that of their newest member.<br />
<br />
No! No way! He couldn&#39;t be &#39;outed&#39; like this in front of Lucas!<br />
<br />
Praying for some solution to reveal itself, Ethan almost considered trying to run or hide, but there was no suitable means to get properly out of sight in time. He froze in place, mind blank -- a buck naked 17 year old with a really small cock -- and then he heard them round the corner, and catch sight of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan?&quot; Lucas&#39; voice came from behind, and it was tinged with real worry. &quot;Is everything all good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Right at the moment, like an angel lending him some divine grace in answer to his prayer, Eric&#39;s sense of cosmic timing struck, intervening when it was needed.<br />
<br />
At the finish of Lucas question, he felt the familiar weird pushing sensation at his groin as the ring&#39;s magic did its work. Face flushed from fear disguised as shyness, Ethan slowly turned around, his girth lightly swinging from its sudden increase in mass milliseconds earlier, the added weight and the gentle rotational motion of his body giving it a glorious masculine sway. Water ran across and dripped from where his fat testicles were crowded between his thighs, onto the floor, and he stood totally exposed in front of the other two boys. His heart was thundering with relief and the thrill of his luck, as Ethan was once again the owner of the largest penis at his school.<br />
<br />
Greg&#39;s mouth dropped open in surprised disbelief, and he frowned.<br />
<br />
But Lucas?<br />
<br />
He was just staring, nearly expressionless, his head tilted, lower lip gently bitten in apparent contemplation, though Ethan could swear, through his shattered nerves, that the gleam in his eye seemed to be almost approving, and maybe ... interested.<br />
<br />
That couldn&#39;t be right though, could it?<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um- ... I ... lost my speedo,&quot; Ethan stammered, his naked embarrassment now genuine.<br />
<br />
Lucas turned and raised an eyebrow at Greg.<br />
<br />
&quot;What exactly,&quot; he asked, pulling his attention reluctantly away from the impressively hung Ethan, &quot;does he have to be insecure about? Looks just fine to me.&quot;</p>
