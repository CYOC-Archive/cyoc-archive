<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As awkward as John felt addressing a dwarf buried face-deep in his ass, he gave it a shot. “You um, sure about this, man? I mean, you’re married. To a woman.”<br />
<br />
“Not anymore,” Sanin grunted, rubbing his boner along the back of John’s thighs and wrapping his arms around his torso. He reached up and put pressure on the top of John’s shoulders, prompting him to crouch down. “And what does it matter, anyhow?” He inhaled deeply, breathing in more of John’s intoxicating musk.<br />
<br />
“The...married part or the woman part?”<br />
<br />
“Aye.”<br />
<br />
John opened his mouth to answer, but no words came out. Sanin took the chance to shove John to the ground, leaving him prone. Kneeling between John’s huge green legs, Sanin spread John’s cheeks, exposing his tender anus to the cooling air. “After bein’ bummed by that cow for God knows how long, it’s time for me to put a hurtin’ on someone.” Sanin said lecherously. “And remember, I owe ye one. I’m gonna let ye get yer rocks off.”<br />
<br />
That sounded good to John’s ears, except for the hurting part. His inner orc snapped to attention at the thought of impending sexy time. “Well, if you’re sure, then -- erk!” John yelped as Sanin spit into his open crack and used his fingers to spread the saliva around. “You’re -- enghh -- such a gentleman. You better wash your hands later.” John muttered.<br />
<br />
“It’s more courtesy than that damn bull offered. Shut yer face and get up.” John obediently got on all fours. Without any more ado, Sanin slammed his straining cock into John’s hole. They both moaned at the same time. John’s muscles clamped down on Sanin’s member as his own became fully erect and moist with precum. It dripped down to the dusty ground below.<br />
<br />
“Ungh! Erngh!” John grunted in time with Sanin’s thrusts. Sanin was being rough. John’s orc body could easily handle it, especially considering the spacious accomodations his large body offered the dwarf’s dick. His orc instincts, however, wanted him to put the inferior pink sack of shit in its place. He saw a clear image of himself grabbing Sanin, flipping him end over end, slamming him to the ground, and violating him just like he was currently doing to him. “Sanin, take it -- ahh -- easy!” John warned.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong? Can’t -- ergh -- take it, my green slave?”<br />
<br />
John’s head reeled around. “What did you call me?” He growled, baring his fangs and red eyes glowing.<br />
<br />
Unafraid of the orc he was fucking, Sanin was about to offer another barb. But then, luckily for both of them, his eyes went crossed and he let out a loud moan. About to cum, he thrusted one final time and in the process finally poked John’s prostate. John’s vision went fuzzy as he was overwhelmed by sexual bliss. With shouts that shook the forest, they both came simultaneously. John unleashed a flood of semen onto the forest floor, and Sanin deposited a paltry in comparison amount into John’s gut. John’s legs got weak, and they both collapsed to the ground, Sanin still embedded in John’s rear. <br />
<br />
They were both silent for a minute, heavy breathing the only sound coming from the both of them. Sanin gently squeezed his body against the massive orc’s form. John was the first to break the silence. “Slave?” he demanded.<br />
<br />
Sanin shrugged. “I wanted to be dominant.” he panted.<br />
<br />
John was happy to let Sanin get his rocks off for once, considering the hell he had previously gone through, but his orcness felt incredibly insulted and he wanted to rip the dwarf’s head off and have an appetizer. John clamped down on his instincts. He was about to say something to Sanin, when the previously spooked horse cautiously walked over to them. Approaching John, she stuck her nose into the small of John’s back and took a few deep breaths. Her nostrils quivered, trapping John’s scent in her nasal passages. Her eyes widening, she quickly turned around and raised her tail. <br />
<br />
“Oh hell no!” John spat. “I’m sorry, but that is where I draw the line!” <br />
<br />
Sanin, still in a post-orgasmic daze, slowly looked up. He chuckled, which evolved into uproarious laughter the longer he looked at the horny horse. Sanin’s cock popped out of John’s butt as he shook with laughter. “Sorry, girl,” he was finally able to get out, wiping tears from his eyes. “Ye be on yer own.”<br />
<br />
John stood up and pulled his loincloth up, having no hope of tucking his still-massive penis away, he tucked it against the garment so it laid straight up over his stomach. “We should probably get this back to the princess,” he said quickly. <br />
<br />
John picked up Sanin and placed him into the mare’s saddle. Sanin kicked the horse to try to get her back to the forest’s path, but the horse was only interested in John. Ignoring the dwarf, her long muzzle extended towards John’s visible penis. John jumped away, just avoiding the horse’s tongue. Sanin roared with laughter. “Ye sure ye don’t want anotha’ girl? She’s interested!”<br />
<br />
John shook his head. Why was he having this effect on people? First Brian, then Sanin and this horse. They somehow became infatuated with him after a short time together. <br />
<br />
“C’mon girl,” Sanin called, shaking her reins. <br />
<br />
The mare snorted. John walked in front of the mare. His scent attracted her, spurring her into a slow trot in his direction. He led her back to the path through the forest; back in the direction of Jenny. He walked at a brisk pace, the mare trying to get closer to his scent. John was a better coaxer for the horse than any carrot. “Well, we’re making good time, at least,” John reasoned.<br />
<br />
After walking for a while, however, John noticed that the mare was being spurred on by Sanin, and wasn’t interested in his scent anymore. It finally clicked for John. It was his sweat! Whenever he was sweating, the aroma caused others nearby to get aroused. This information sunk into John’s head. He glanced back at Sanin. He had a blank expression on his face, like a “what did I just do” look. Sanin had eye contact with John and quickly looked away. John frowned. They continued onwards in suddenly uncomfortable silence.<br />
<br />
“You okay?” John finally asked.<br />
<br />
Sanin sighed. “I dunno why I did that,” he said quietly.<br />
<br />
“It’s all right. I enjoyed it,” John said.<br />
<br />
Sanin stared straight ahead, silently shaking his head. John frowned. They continued in silence.</p>
