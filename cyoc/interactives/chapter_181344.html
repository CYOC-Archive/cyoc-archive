<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly lifting himself off the floor, Max returns his gaze to the mirror hanging in his bathroom. His dream was true: He now sports a buzzcut, a far cry from his once long locks, and his body has transformed to that of any other jock at his high school. His pecs push against the fabric of his wife beater, and lifting the tank top up, he runs his burly hand against his set of washboard abs. Lifting a now muscular arm up, he curiously sniffs his hairy armpit. &quot;Ugh! I fucking stink!&quot; Astonished by his new body odor and natural use of foul language, he brings his arm down and continues looking at himself. His shoulders and neck also seem to have grown a good bit, giving him that meathead look that is characteristic of most jocks, including the ones he used to hate. Thinking of Seth, who was also in his dream last night, he is confused as his dick begins to pulsate and harden. Pulling his underwear down and bringing his hand to the tip, he begins to rub it as he explores his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Giving me that jacket, without a care in the world—not that paper, homework, or anything—just football. I want to be like that.&quot; With his dick completely erect and beginning to leak a bit of pre, he begins pumping his hand up and down. As his hips buck and he involuntarily moans with pleasure, he sees flashes of memories he didn&#39;t know he had: He and Seth getting on the football team together, them growing closer over the years, Max having secret feelings for him, and even he and Seth dropping out of advanced classes to join the rest of the jocks in basic courses. Thinking of Seth, he feels his mouth contorting into that trademark jock grin that he&#39;s seen so many times. &quot;Unhhh...&quot; Approaching his climax, Max is suddenly scared by a tangible feeling of intelligence leaving him as his enlarged member begins shooting out streams of warm jock seed all over the bathroom tile. He also feels a part of him slipping away, quickly being replaced by a new, Jock Max that&#39;s douchey and cocky. As his dick spurts out the last bit of cum, Max rips off a piece of toilet paper, dries the tip of his dick, and grabs a notebook from his backpack. Flipping through it, he is horrified to see that his notes on macroeconomics and chemistry are gone, replaced by chicken scratch and sketches for his personal finance and remedial natural science classes.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... What have I done?&quot; Trying to think back to the concepts of his chemistry class he knows he was in, Max is unable to think of anything from that class, instead remembering only basic concepts from his natural science class. Beginning an existential crisis, Max is brought back to reality by his mom yelling from downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Max! Hurry up and get ready! We have to leave in 15!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifteen min-&quot; He&#39;s unable to finish the word minutes as his voice suddenly cracks. &quot;Woah...&quot; Massaging his neck, he tries talking again to find that his voice has dropped an entire octave to better match his new jock status. Additionally, his Adam&#39;s apple now bobs prominently on his muscular neck. &quot;I-I&#39;m almost ready,&quot; Max lies to his mom in his new jock voice. Pulling open the drawers below his sink cabinet, he is relieved to find a stick of deodorant covered in loose, curly armpit hairs. &quot;Gross,&quot; he thinks as he pops the cap off and rubs it over his pits a couple times. Moving to his hair, he quickly remembers that it&#39;s no longer a concern—in fact, the buzzcut is growing on him. After quickly brushing his teeth, Max moves to his closet and sees what he&#39;s got. Gone are his nerdy, X-small clothes, now replaced by tank tops, jerseys, polos, basketball shorts, sneakers, and chains. Knowing he&#39;s running low on time and with a changed sense of fashion from his first jack off session as a jock, he pulls out a pair of mesh basketball shorts, a pair of white Air Force 1s, a pair of white Nike socks, and a thin, silver chain. Throwing these on, he reaches for his football jersey that&#39;s hanging on the back of his desk chair—The football team always wear their jerseys on game-day. Feeling the mesh of the jersey and the printed on number, 73, he throws the jersey over his head and pulls it on. Admiring himself in the full-length mirror tucked in the corner of his room, he confidently smirks at himself and turns to head downstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Max,&quot; His Mom says as he enters the kitchen, &quot;Some of your friends are here to pick you up today!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends?&quot; Max thinks to himself as he looks out the window. Sitting in a car parked in front of his house sit Seth, Brian, and Bryce. Seeing them all with their football jerseys on, too, Max&#39;s new jock mind creates memories of him and this friend group from years past. With the memories in place, Max enthusiastically grabs his backpack and runs outside to meet his friends. &quot;See ya, Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye, Max! Have a good day at school and practice,&quot; she yells after him.<br />
<br />
Hopping in the car with his fellow jocks, Max is hit in the face with a strong, musky smell. &quot;What&#39;s up, Bro?&quot; Seth asks as he reaches to dap Max up. Somehow knowing how to dap, Max reaches over and daps up Seth and the rest of the guys. &quot;You ready for the game tonight?&quot; Brian asks him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah, we&#39;re gonna kill them.&quot; Max says confidently as Brian steps on the gas to head to school.</p>
