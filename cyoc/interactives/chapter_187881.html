<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Quester&quot; was a man who at his group that could roughly be called a guild that enjoyed taking on quests of all kinds. From small insignificant tasks that just helped the merriment of maybe a few kids to intermediate quests where he got in semi-danger, but with good prep he wasn&#39;t ever in much of any trouble. Like everyone else in the guild he had his nickname, and didn&#39;t give out his actual name but it was still a close knit group. They treated their nicknames like their actual names after the apocalypse with all the people having effectively lost their families during the initial chaos. They all shared a large guild house and knew each other very well... Even if about 90% of the members were men. <br />
Quester&#39;s best friend Woody was collapsed on a sofa after having marathon sprinted back and forth from a mine to a kingdom&#39;s forges several times that day to train his mining and smithing skills... Along with getting some sprint xp which always just seemed to be out of his grasp for another level up. Woody had gone from a scrawny guy who played too many games to a very fit individual after having skilled at so many aspects that required top shape fitness. Although his nickname came from the fact that he had just skilled a lot of woodcutting and firemaking when he found the guild. It was getting a little bit late, but often the combat guys would just lose track of time in the dungeons and come back whenever and currently the rest of the skillers were busy with less physically demanding skills and weren&#39;t as tired as Woody was yet. <br />
The Guild doors opened revealing a warrior coating in a greenish blue armor. However based on some indentations at the chest and general height of the warrior Quester had to guess it was one of the guild&#39;s female... combat types? Did they have a female quester? Woody knew that he was one of the better skillers, and he wasn&#39;t even able to wear enchanted armor yet from what little combat he needed to do. The female wearing enchanted armor walked up to Woody and then took off her helmet revealing... a familiar looking face, but it was that of a woman he hadn&#39;t met yet.<br />
The woman said &quot;Hey Woody, I just got knighted!&quot; <br />
&quot;Um... How did-&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh that was simple. Talked to this old dude, he gave me a few trials, passed them, and now I&#39;m a knight of the kingdom... The gear he gave me sucks but I&#39;ve got some prestige.&quot; <br />
&quot;No, I mean how do you know me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh come on Woody, it&#39;s me Quester!&quot; The woman said banging her fist on her boob... breastplate. <br />
&quot;...So... what&#39;s up with the being a woman thing?&quot;<br />
The girl then looked at herself again and said &quot;Shit, forgot to get this thing reversed... You prep something so bodily changingly drastic at the start of a quest, and by the end of the quest you just kinda get used to it. So one of the tasks was to kill this black knight no man could beat.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you just changed your gender?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, he wasn&#39;t hard to beat just literally impervious to attacks men hit him with. Was meaning to change back to normal after the quest, but it slipped me mind.&quot; Quester said chuckling &quot;Well don&#39;t really feel like going out this late... Got dinner ready?&quot; Quester said eyes gleaming with excitement. Quester held out her arm which Woody grabbed as the two went to a table, and Woody produced a large pizza with so many different kinds of meats and a bunch of flagons of ale. Meanwhile Quester got herself into relaxation mode as she took off her armor bit by bit, and then took off her breastplate letting her large breasts rest against the table as she leaned down a bit. &quot;Everything smells great... Nothing like some good food, ale, and a great friend to unwind after a day like this right?&quot;<br />
Woody blushed a little and asked &quot;So... the wizard that did that... did he also change your clothes?&quot;<br />
Quester said  &quot;Well my armor changed to fit... I&#39;m thankfully my platelegs didn&#39;t change into a plateskirt... Technically the stats wouldn&#39;t change but I&#39;d just feel silly you know?&quot;<br />
&quot;So your actual clothes didn&#39;t change.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not much... it fits...&quot; Quester blushed a bit and said &quot;underwear changed a little though...&quot; <br />
During their meal conversation Quester seemed to be paying more attention to some of the small cute critters Woody saw on his sprinting marathons. Also when Woody produced a diamond ring he was planning on selling the next day Quester looked a little surprised.<br />
When she remembered what was going on she joked &quot;Aw, giving your girlfriend a ring already?&quot; <br />
Woody felt his heart skip a beat as well and asked &quot;I know this feels weird, but do you want to try that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Try what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Being a couple... I don&#39;t know... This could just be my lack of contact with girls, and that you&#39;ve mostly been my best bud for a long time... Being some weird combination that makes me attracted to this new you, but... Would you at least like trying to be boyfriend and girlfriend?&quot;<br />
Quester&#39;s heart was beating as she wasn&#39;t sure what to say for the moment. She had been feeling a little nervous around Woody, and she couldn&#39;t help but find his abs and muscles that were shown off quite nicely by his thin tanktop pretty attractive... but she figured that was just her odd hormones and that would change back soon... But while other guild members may find this change weird... Well what did she have that really tied her down to just being a man, and what if becoming  Woody&#39;s girlfriend was actually the right choice for her? &quot;I... I&#39;ll give it a shot.&quot; Quester said unsure of her emotions, but feeling like this may be a good opportunity.</p>
