<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The meeting with Miss Fabina had been quite helpful for Naomi when it came to narrowing down what kind of Animalian to become, and tree squirrels were known for good balance and acrobatic skills as they moved around the forests that they lived in. However, while narrowing down the specific animal group down was relatively easy, going to the various species within that group wasn&#39;t. For squirrels had a global range that had many different species to them. There were even some that lived on the ground and in burrows rather than in trees. And from the list that Horizon provided, they had an extensive list of different squirrel species.<br />
<br />
&quot;So many to choose from,&quot; Naomi mused as she flipped through the pamphlet that Horizon provided which included the list of specific species and with pictures of them.<br />
<br />
Many of them weren&#39;t too different from each other with their small sizes, long fluffy tails, and with similar colorations. Most were some variation of tan brown, tan-orange, tan-gray, or gray colorations, though there were some standouts. There were &quot;giant squirrels &quot; that had some distinctive patterns in how their dorsal side&#39;s color matched with their under-belly&#39;s coloration. There was the &quot;Kaibab Squirrel,&quot; a subspecies of the Abert&#39;s Squirrel from North America with a largely dark brown body with a white tail. It was all interesting and this made Naomi stop and think for a bit on all the various choices that she had. Though, Naomi did settle on one species, and one that was in a way close to home, the Japanese Squirrel. It wasn&#39;t too distinct from many of the other squirrel species, but it was something close to home and with some of the other things going on regard travel and health standards, something from &quot;home&quot; counted for more than flashy coloration.<br />
<br />
With that, she filled out the forms needed and made her way into Horizon for her conversion. She eventually met with a Doctor Stein who came to meet her in one of the waiting rooms in the offices that were there. He smiled to her, and she was a bit relieved that he didn&#39;t shrink from her or look nervous. Her height and size were always something that she&#39;d wrestled with and being reminded of that height was not something she wanted, and thus why she was accepting on becoming a Squirrel Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must thank you for all this,&quot; Naomi said to him, &quot;it may be odd... but doing this... it might let me feel more... normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we try to do our best,&quot; Dr. Stein said politely as he opened the door to one of the conversion rooms and allowed Naomi the room to enter.<br />
<br />
The lights were already on as Naomi entered, and she could clearly see the spartan nature of the room. She sighed as she listened to Doctor Stein follow her in and place a plastic case down on the bed that was in the room. It gave an audible click that was easily detectable and made her look back to him. She could see the syringes in their safety caps and areas inside the case and knew that the doctor was ready and she would get her own new start, and while she didn&#39;t expect to get any smaller, she did have the sense that she wouldn&#39;t get too much larger and then when compared to other Animalians, she wouldn&#39;t feel like the giant that she often felt like because of her height.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready, doctor,&quot; Naomi stated as she moved back to sit on the bed and undoing her shoes, figuring she&#39;d worry about decoration and style for where she&#39;d be while acclimating and worrying over other health issues once she&#39;d finished the conversion.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded as she sat down while readying the first syringe and then said to her, &quot;Very good... Hopefully this will give you the happiness and belonging you desire. Welcome to Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he then administered the shots. They didn&#39;t hurt, but Naomi could feel the room seeming to get a bit warmer as the second shot was delivered. She raised up one hand to wave so as to fan himself while Doctor Stein left the room. As the door clicked shut and Naomi was left alone she felt a slight itching sensation start on her arm and that brought her attention over to it. Growing in was presently a coat of downy fur that was largely a tannish gray running down her arms. On the inside of her bicep there was some white fur growing in as well. Between that there was a very narrow band of tan far that then wrapped around the top of her hand. Meanwhile her fingers had more grayish fur and short, curved, and sharp claws were growing out from her finger tips, perfect for climbing trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ittttttttts happening!&quot; Naomi said happily, her voice taking on a slight &quot;chitter&quot; while saying the word &quot;it,&quot; and that got her up to see more.<br />
<br />
As she stood up, she heard a few cracking sounds as her feet lengthened slightly and as her face began to push forward into short muzzle that most squirrels were known for. Though the thing that worried her a little was the lengthening of her feet. Most Animalians had a digitigrade leg which reflected the fact that nearly every animal walked or ran on its toes, and hoofed animals like horses to that to the extreme where they were essentially standing on their toenail and this trait largely carried over to Animalians to varying degrees. Some didn&#39;t have it as much, and Squirrel Animalians fell within that category, but Naomi knew that as she rose up onto the balls of her feet in her transformation, she would actually get taller. She hoped it wasn&#39;t by too much.<br />
<br />
However, there were a couple of other things that got her attention. As her face pushed forward, and to an outside observer it might look far more painful than it in fact was, Naomi ran her tongue along her teeth, and sure enough the front two teeth on her upper and lower jaws were enlarging and strengthening, becoming the large incisors that all squirrels were known for. Some of her surrounding teeth seemed to melt away and merge with her growing incisors while her molars also gained some size and strength. The other sensation was a general tightness in her pants and shirt. This made her look down to see her breasts swelling forward and outward, growing in size and roundness, and arousing her a bit as they pressed against her shirt.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d known that Animalian females were well known for their voluptuous bodies with their smallest bra cups starting at D and getting progressively larger. She&#39;d thought she&#39;d seen some reports that the Sauropod Dinotopians were in the L to M range, but she was sure that had to be a typo. Regardless, she&#39;d dressed rather loosely and comfortably to give herself &quot;room to grow&quot; in that department and a part of it did feel good as the weight of her growing breasts became more apparent. The other part, though was with her pants, and while they had enough &quot;room&quot; for her growing rear and hips, her tail was coming in too. And it was the confining of her tail that was the most uncomfortable. Naomi had to pull her pants down a bit to free her tail and then pull them back up, but leaving them below her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better,&quot; Naomi said to herself as she looked over her shoulder to see her tail growing out behind her, and now free of her pants he seemed to grow faster with coat color that looked like one had mixed tan-brown, black, and gray together. But her tail was growing out and her fur looked fluffy, and as her ears settled onto points at the top of her head and poked through her hair, she again smiled. She even took some pride in figuring out the muscle groups that controlled the moving of her tail. While she hadn&#39;t gotten a full look at herself in the mirror, she did think she looked good.</p>
