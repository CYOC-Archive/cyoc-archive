<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice sat on the edge of Max&#39;s bed, facing the window with her eyes closed and her hands folded on the top of her belly, enjoying the morning warmth on her skin, and fondly remembering the previous night, then a familiar pair of lips brushed against her neck, and a pair of hands held her belly, one bandaged and one not, Alice smiled sweetly as she let his hands wander her bare skin, letting out a small coo as Max&#39;s hands snaked to her sensetive underbelly, &quot;Don&#39;t start something we don&#39;t have time to finish babe&quot; warned Alice as she peaked one eye open and turned her head to look at Max who had a nervous smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something tells me that Linda and Lina are feeling a bit left out from last night, and I don&#39;t know how to make it up to them&quot; sighed Max as he then sat next to her, before he let out another long sigh and stood up and turned to face Alice, extending his good hand, which Alice gladly accepted as she heaved herself up, arching her back to relive the sudden pressure on her spine from the sudden change in stance, groaning as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think that Sofia is thinking&quot; Asked Alice, raising an eyebrow to Max, who looked away, drumming his fingers against his leg as he walked into his wardrobe &quot;I don&#39;t know babe, but what I door know is that there are four women in this penthouse, three of which are or are on the way to being extremely pregnant, and are all probably hungry&quot; said Max with a smile as he herd Alice stomach growl &quot;you have a point&quot; said Alice as she rolled her eyes and waddled towards the door before turning her head to blow a kiss to Max, who gladly did the same leaving them both chuckling at their corny gesture &quot;ok Romeo, il see you when your dressed&quot; she called as she walked out the door.<br />
<br />
The hallway to the bedroom&#39;s was connected to the kitchen, Max&#39;s room being the door closest to the kitchen, with the other five rooms lining the same wall, with Linda&#39;s next to Max&#39;s, then Alice&#39;s, then linas and now finally Sofia&#39;s who&#39;s door was yet to be given a paint job or nameplate, but if Alice knew Linda, she knew that her wife wouldn&#39;t be able to resist an excuse to decorate for long, the opposite wall to the bedroom doors had a large glass sliding door, with a gym setup inside with the wall facing the door being one large mirror, with weights and yoga mats and exercises balls being set up over the grey padded floor, and next to the gym was the washroom, and judging by the steam that came from under the door, someone had already beaten her to the shower, and finally at the end of the hallway was a sealing high wooden door with a glass rectangle in the center that led to Linas rooftop garden.<br />
<br />
But Alice&#39;s priorities at the moment were finding where her daughter had run, or rather waddled off to, and to feed her babies, who were gradually letting their mother know that they were hungry, and bumps apeared and disappeared on Alice&#39;s belly&#39;s skin, causing Alice to groan whenever one of her wombs occupants scored a well aimed kick to her ribs or her bladder &quot;Oooohhhhh ok babies ok I know, il get you fed as soon as I- nnnngggh, can ok?&quot; Pleaded Alice quietly as she rubbed slow wide circles on her belly to calm her brood as she leaned her back against the wall.<br />
<br />
Once Alice had calmed her babies she began waddling down the hallway towards the kitchen, when all of a sudden she could hear light sobbing, and Sofia&#39;s voice, it sounded like she was talking to someone, but her voice was to muffled, so quietly as she could manage, Alice crept closer to the edge of the hallway and peaked around the corner, to see Sofia sat at the kitchen island, both her elbow on the counter as she held a piece of paper, tears down her cheeks as she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mama, Papa, I should have stayed, I shouldn&#39;t have ran, now il never get to say goodbye, bebe Charlie will have to live without his true Mama, I don&#39;t think I can do what you did Mama, I need help, por favor envíe una señal, cualquier cosa&quot; she said, before finally she could take it no longer and Alice stepped out from behind the corner and waddled as fast as she could over to her daughter, Sofia suddenly looking up at Alice, yet made no attempt to stop or hide her tears, and simply caved into Alice&#39;s embrace, their bellies pressed against eachother as they held eachother, despite their passionate moment last night, Alice had forgotten that the pain of loosing her parents was still fresh, and still painful, she wouldn&#39;t make that mistake again.<br />
<br />
But then Sofia put her arms around Alice&#39;s neck and pressed her lips against Alice&#39;s, a desperate need in her kiss, but Alive simply let her, if this helped her know that her mommy was here for her then so be it, not that Alice was complaining as she returned Sofias kiss before pulling away to look Sofia in the eye before kissing Sofia lightly on her forehead &quot;feeling a little bit better?&quot; Askes Alice, Sofia only nodded as she wiped her tears, her eyes still red from her outburst, but then her face scrunched up as she let out a groan, both of her hands flying to her belly as one of Charlie&#39;s feet kicked out as far as he could manage, making a large bump accross Sofias belly &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into him mom, he&#39;s been like this almost all morning&quot; groaned Sofia as another one of Charlie&#39;s kicks became visible accross Sofias belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up a second honney&quot; said Alice as she sat down on one of the bar stools, spreading her legs to let her swolen womb fall into the gap between, Sofia heaved herself up and waddled over to Alice, who placed her ear against her daughters belly, pressing her fingers into strain places to try and find what was going on, then a loud growling sound echoed through Sofias belly, and once again Charlie let out another kick, poor Sofia unable to do anything else bot rub her belly to try and calm the baby within, but Alice only check and placed a kiss on Sofias popped out naval &quot;don&#39;t worry baby, nothings wrong, you and Charlie are just hungry is all, and apparently he gets cranky when he&#39;s hungry&quot; chuckled Alice as Sofia eased herself back down onto the stool &quot; well you could have found a less painful way to tell me pequeño&quot; said Sofia to her belly, giving it a playful slap.<br />
<br />
Then the sound of multiple people came from down the hallway, then into the kitchen stepped Max, Lina and Linda, lina wearing a towel around her tits and pregnant belly, while Linda much like Sofia and Alice was completely bare, her smooth pale skin on full display, yet something about her seemed different...<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning all!&quot; Called Lina cheerfully as she removed both her towels and threw them perfectly into the laundry shoot, then proceeding to fist pump the air &quot;Someone&#39;s in a good mood this morning&quot; said Max as he walked over to the stove and got out a pan and then proceeded to look in the fridge for the ingredients for pancakes, only to be pulled away by Lina who then proceeded to whisper something in his ear &quot;REALY?&quot; Said Max excitedly as he got down on his knees and placed his ear to Linas baby bump, Lina tilting her hips forward do make it easier for him, Max and Lina then let out a small gasp before Max began nuzzling and kissing Linas belly &quot;hello to you too little ones&quot; he sighed before he stood up and gave Lina a kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was all that about&quot; chuckled Alice as she turned to look at Lina who was holding her belly with a look of pride I her face &quot;the babies have been making their first little movements&quot; sqeeled Lina as she waddled over to Alice and Linda who eagerly leaned in to feel, cooing and fussing over the triplets little flutters of movement before Lina turned to face Sofia, seeing her red eyes and the photo on the counter &quot;would you like to feel as well sweetie?&quot; Asked Lina, watching as Sofias sadness was replaced by excitement and curiosity as she practically hugged around Linas bulge, which caused Lina to regain her ballance, before smiling down at Sofia as she stroked the young girl&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
Alice sighed happily at the sceen infront of her as Linda came up behind her and wrapped her arms around her before she knelt down to whisper on Alice&#39;s ear &quot;Hey babe I have a secret&quot; she whispered nervously, Alice smiled and looked at Linda with a playful smirk &quot;I may have gone into the UGA case last night.....and may or may not have.....ummm..&quot;.<br />
<br />
Alice&#39;s smile fell as a look of shock now covered her face &quot;how many and how old&quot; said Alice quietly, Linda then let out a small groan as her hand covered her belly &quot;seven in total, all 4 weeks old!&quot; Cried Linda as her belly lurched forward.....</p>
