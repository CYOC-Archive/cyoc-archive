<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad was still cleaning up from his experience of watching his formerly out of shape neighbor become a young hot stud.  The doorbell rang and Brad looked out the window.  It was the pizza delivery boy.   As Brad went for his wallet he saw the screen and decided to see if he could do something else.  Checking the options he quickly found the front door and an image of the pizza boy popped up on the screen along with options for change.  <br />
  &quot;Not bad&quot;, Brad muttered as he saw the 17 year old kid standing at the door.  A little bit on the skinny side and a definitely not a jock or one of the popular kids.  His daughters knew all the popular kids and Brad had never seen this kid before.  He noticed that the kid was getting ready to ring the doorbell again so he rushed to the front door before anyone else came to answer.  Brad opened the door and saw the kid - exactly as he appeared on the screen<br />
  &quot;Evening sir, I have two cheese pizzas and an order of bread-sticks, it comes to $18.00 even&quot;<br />
   &quot;Oh sure thing - let me get my wallet okay - didn't expect you so soon.&quot;  Brad took the order from the kids hands and quickly placed the pizzas on the table then he went over to his study and checked the screen.  He clicked on the age, height and physique options and quickly saw the kid's stats appear on the screen - Jim was 17 years old, 5' 8&quot; tall and his weight was showing 165 lbs.  Brad quickly changed some numbers and decided on a few more options.  He hit the enter key and rushed over to the door to see what would happen.<br />
  Jim was still at the front door - pacing a little - he hated when he had to wait for payment like this - didn't people realize he had to make other deliveries.  Brad quickly approached Jim and told him to come on inside.  Jim took a few steps into the house as Brad opened his wallet.<br />
  &quot;You said $18.00 right?&quot; Brad asked Jim<br />
  Jim figured that this guy was going to hand him a $20.00 and tell him to keep the change - another big spender- &quot;That's right sir $18.00&quot;<br />
  As soon as Jim said the words he felt strange.  He couldn't move - he was frozen in place.  Brad looked at Jim and noticed that the kid  had stopped talking and wasn't moving. He then noticed some changes occurring to Jim.  Jim's body started to get bigger.  He went from 5' 8&quot; to close to 6' tall in a matter of seconds.  Jim's height stopped  at 6' 2&quot;.  This jeans were several inches too short on him as was his shirt and shoes.  His really thin body then started to expand.  His chest was filling out, becoming very firm. His shoulders widened as did his legs.  Soon the clothes he was wearing started to tear open.    Brad was staring at the changes that were happening to the kid.  He watched as he noticed the kid's face start to change.  He looked like he was in his early  20's.  Brad watched as the kid's stubble became darker and thicker.  The face became more manly.  In a matter of minutes the former 17 kid was now a 35 year old muscled stud.  Brad quickly went to his study to see if there was anything he could do about the kid's shredded uniform and found an option listed there.  Brad decided to get the kid dressed in a suit and tie - sort of the same thing he was wearing.  Brad pressed enter and quickly went back to check it out.  He saw the torn clothes the kid was wearing gradually change into a business man's clothing. The kid's black boxer briefs changed into blue full cut boxer shorts and his white sport socks become black dress socks that went up and past the kid's now thick and hairy calves.  The torn sneakers became highly polished black lace-ups and the jeans and pizza store shirt turned into a finely cut dark suit, white dress shirt and red tie.  Brad took out a fifty dollar bill from his wallet and watched as the kid finally started to move.<br />
  &quot;sir that will be $18.00 please&quot;  - he told Brad - but his voice sounded different, deeper.<br />
  Brad held out the $50.00 bill to Jim.  As Jim reached for the bill he noticed that he was wearing a suit jacket.<br />
  &quot;What the...  Jim was getting scared he looked down and noticed that he was taller and wearing a suit and black shoes.  He looked over and saw a mirror on the wall but the reflection wasn't his.  He looked like a beefed up version of his father.  Jim held up his hand and noticed how much bigger it was.  He took an uncertain step close to the mirror and noticed that he even had some gray hair.<br />
 &quot; What is going on here?&quot; Jim was getting really scared now.<br />
  &quot;Don't worry Jim everything is going to be fine&quot; Brad tried to calm the scared teen/man.<br />
  &quot;Hey dad did the pizza get here?&quot; Brad's daughter yelled out from the other room.  As she walked over to the front door Brad quickly closed the door and whispered to Jim - &quot;Just play along for a little while okay&quot;<br />
  Jim just shook his head not knowing what was going on.<br />
 Brad's daughter walked up to the front door.  <br />
  &quot;Hey Dad - who's this?&quot;<br />
   Hi hon, this is one of my coworkers, Jim we have to finish up some business tonight so we can't be bothered.  There is pizza on the table&quot;<br />
   &quot;Great - nice meeting you&quot;  she said to Jim as she walked out to get the pizza.<br />
  Brad turned to Jim - &quot; Now let's see what this can do now&quot;  and guided Jim over to the study</p>
