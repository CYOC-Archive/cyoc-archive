<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The book, being the all powerful thing it was, was definitely something Ken wanted to try out even more. It easily was able to change a girl, making her go through various different changes. By this point, Ken wanted to go even more bombastic.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the book, flicking through the pages until it landed on the page of the city that he currently lived in. Besides the history of the city and the floor plan of his city, most of the page wasn&#39;t filled with much detail. That was about to change as Ken got to work on changing his city.<br />
<br />
The first thing he did was put what could effectively be described as a curse on the city. The curse would affect men and women differently, with certain aspects changing based on an individual&#39;s gender.<br />
<br />
For women, they would effectively become bimbos. For any women who enters the the 5 mile radius of the city limits, they would slowly become one of five kinds of bimbos with the process speeding the closer they got to the city centre. A typical bimbo that a woman transforms into would be a super hourglass figure with large child-birthing hips, atleast H cup breasts, an ass bigger then a hatchback etc. Some bimbos would have puffy, cock-sucking lips but not all of them do. The bimbos in the city will have a maximum IQ of 60 at most, so anyone who has an IQ higher then that would lose their intelligence as long as they are in the city.<br />
<br />
Any female born within the city will only start developing features of a Bimbo by age 12, however they will only finish their transformation once they reach 16. The transformation for them won&#39;t increase even if they are close or in the city centre.<br />
<br />
For men, the transformation is similar but also different to women. Men will gain muscles and become more physically fit in appearance. Their penises will enlarge by a significant amount and easily create a bulge in their pants, if they are wearing any. As for men&#39;s IQ, instead of losing intelligence, they will rapidly gain intelligence, with a suggested link that intelligence is transferred from a woman undergoing the transformation, to a man undergoing the transformation. <br />
<br />
As for how the city will be different, the layout will mostly be the same except the city centre. Besides high-rise offices, the city centre will be filled with casinos, strip clubs, prostitution centres, love hotels and many other facilities where the bimbos could work at. Around the city, it isn&#39;t uncommon to find people naked and fucking, even out in the open. This is due to many people being constantly horny due to the over sexualised people around them so people dating or married couples will often fuck in the streets. It isn&#39;t illegal to do it in the city either as indecency isn&#39;t a crime in the city limits.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the bimbos, the five types of bimbos that a woman can end up as will always decide what career they now will take.<br />
<br />
The first type are the &#39;secretitties&#39;. These are the smartest bimbos in the city and have the minimum amount of change possible. They will often speak in a normal way and have the maximum intelligence possible, the 60 IQ limit, which will help with the career they take. Based on their nicknames, Secretitties often end up as secretaries. This is due to the fact that these were often woman in high class positions so they try to keep that high class career. These bimbos are often hesitant to get naked and at first hate their transformation, so the manager who they end up working for, will &#39;teach&#39; them to love the city and embrace the culture their.<br />
<br />
The next type are the &#39;servers&#39;. They only scrape 50 IQ and have slightly larger assets then the secretitties. These bimbos typically work as waitresses or playboy bunnies in casinos, cafes and restraunts. This is because while they are still bimbos, they actually have gained quite good hand-eye coordination that allows them to carry a lot of items while walking in high heels. They are the only other type of bimbo to have a lower libido then the other types, besides secretitties.<br />
<br />
The third type are the housewives. Only having about 40 IQ, only in facts about taking care of a family and house, these bimbos are the 2nd most curvaceous type of bimbo in the city. They all end up as housewives, married to a man who is much larger then them. They only will ever wear aprons and a wedding ring, unless they go outside where they will wear high heels. These bimbos are also much more fertile then other, often giving birth to twins or triplets if they get pregnant. Other bimbos can become housewives if they get married and have kids, so by that point they will quit their previous jobs.<br />
<br />
The fourth type are the cattle. This type of bimbo live in special cages across the city and have the most drastic physical and mental change out of all of the bimbos. Having Q cup breasts at minimum, they are treated as cows by society due to their innate ability to produce gallons of milk. Their nipples have extended and enlarged to be more like cow teats, with the fast majority of the bimbos bodyweight being fat centred around the ass, thighs and breasts. They have barely an IQ, besides eating sleeping, moving and mating. Some men even pay the cattle owners to mate with one of them of their choosing if the cattle hadn&#39;t already mated before. These bimbos can&#39;t end up as housewives so they will end up taking care of their children in a similar way to cows, unless the child is male in which they will have their child taken off them to be taught in a better environment.<br />
<br />
The final type are the depraved. These bimbos are similar in appearance to secretitties but have much higher libido then all over bimbos. They typically have an IQ of around 40, and will work in strip clubs and as prostitutes. Some of the depraved will go around the city to force any unsuspecting citizens to have sex with them. These bimbos often are unmarried, and will have to look after their children on their own, unless they get married where they become housewives with a higher libido level then normal.<br />
<br />
As Jen finished writing, he could feel the changes begin as he saw the map of the city layout begin to alter slightly.</p>
