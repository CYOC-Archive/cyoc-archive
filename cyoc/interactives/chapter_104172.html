<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire lay back on the blanket that Bob had layed out for and felt the sensation of her fur rubbing against it. It itched a little, and actually made Claire think on how much things had changed in her life. She had come to photograph wildlife and had come as a completely normal human being. The &quot;old&quot; Claire would have laughed or disbelieved anyone telling her that she would one day become a nearly nine foot tall weretigress complete with fur, claws, fangs, and a tail to match. In fact, she hadn&#39;t fully believed things when she had first seen the two younger werewolves out in the woods. And now, here she was, a were and basking in the afterglow of &quot;round 3.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire?&quot; came Bob&#39;s voice from beside her, &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire looked back to him and smiled, &quot;Yes. I feel great. I&#39;m just marveling at how things have changed for me in the short time I&#39;ve been here... and just how much I have changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
And she did like it. In fact a good part of her was ready to go for a round four, and figure out just where her sexual stamina had climbed to as a result of her transformation. However, now that her transformation had completed, her mind began to drift back to Ryan. Seeing him transform in front of her to show her what he looked like in his wolven form, seeing his penis grow larger as he changed before it being pulled into a canine sheath. Bob&#39;s was bigger, but then tigers were MUCH larger than wolves in nature  and given the combination of human and animal in weres, it made sense that Bob, a weretiger, would have bigger equipment than Ryan, a werewolf.  <br />
<br />
Yet, while Bob was friendly and had been VERY good at welcoming her into were-society, there wasn&#39;t really that much that made think about Bob as anything more than just a potential friend and pride mate. He was good &quot;in bed&quot; as it were, but that was about it. When she thought of Ryan though, there seemed to not only be major sexual curiosity as to how good he was in his wolven form, there was also something more. More on an emotional and personal level. He had been kind to her when he had no reason to. He had been understanding of her confusion, when he had no reason to. He stood up for her and gave her the opportunity to make her choice when he had no need to. He had befriended her and did a lot to show her the good side of Moon Lake and being a were. Claire didn&#39;t think that she would have even made a choice to be a were without Ryan being there. She might have chosen to be a weretiger, but in his own way, Ryan was the reason for that decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ve become quite marvelous, if I may say so,&quot; Bob said to her, nuzzling his head to Claire&#39;s, &quot;And a part of me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wish I would be yours and not Ryan&#39;s?&quot; Claire asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Bob admitted, &quot;it&#39;s shallow, I know... but it is how I feel...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Claire smiled to him and stood up, &quot;You&#39;re fun... and I must thank you for transforming me... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You love him,&quot; Bob finished as he watched Claire begin to transform back.<br />
<br />
Her fur was pulled inside her, as was her tail. Her ears slid to the sides of her head while her claws rounded and became human fingernails again. Her muscle mass lost some of the additional definition that it had in her were form, but as Claire returned to her human form, she found that she was far more muscular than the &quot;old&quot; her was. It wasn&#39;t quite female body builder definition and that it didn&#39;t take anything away from her enhanced femininity, even in her human form. She was now closer to top level female athlete, like the Williams sisters or Rhonda Rousey. Bob could easily see that Claire was still taller than she was before her transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Claire said as she thought of Ryan, and began to put together how their first sexual encounter would go. She and Ryan would return to his apartment, go to his bedroom, and proceed to make passionate love to each other once they arrived, letting their inner beasts as they did so. &quot;He&#39;s been good to me... friendly to me... and been welcoming to me. I know the town wouldn&#39;t have given me a choice in what to become with out him... for fear that I would have exposed your secret... And he&#39;s been a perfect gentleman... a knight in fuzzy wolf armor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a different way of putting it,&quot; Bob commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... shining armor works too, but I thought it would fit Ryan more the way I had it,&quot; Claire commented, &quot;but I do love him. If it&#39;s alright... I&#39;d love to bring him as a guest at future meetings... and if I can&#39;t or he doesn&#39;t have the time... I&#39;m sure we might be able to work out something... but Ryan is the were I want to spend my next four centuries with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob slowly nodded, &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll make you happy. He&#39;s a good man... I wish it were me, but Ryan is a good catch to. I&#39;m not bi or gay... but I know Ryan is a good man. If I were a straight woman... I might want him to.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a bit of a pause as the two of them looked to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounded a lot better in my head,&quot; Bob said to her as he changed back himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Claire commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Bob then spoke once he&#39;d changed back and began to fold up the blanket, &quot;this would technically be the end of the meeting and you&#39;re quite free to go to him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And see how long we can go before tiring,&quot; Claire smiled, already fantasizing of Ryan&#39;s knot penetrating her and him marveling at her new muscles and curves as they roared and howled into the night. &quot;And he did bring me back from the hospital and should be waiting for us to finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob nodded, &quot;then we can go back to the pavilion, gather your things and go to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that the two of them began walking. Her things were folded and waiting at the pavilion and things were quiet in the immediate area. Of course, she could hear pleasure filled roars echoing from the woods around the area. The others were having a good time, and Claire could understand that now as well. In fact, her nipples were still hard and her clit was more than ready for Ryan. She loved him, wanted him, and with regard to pack versus pride meetings, Claire was finding herself surprisingly open to letting Ryan have time with Barbara at his pack meetings, since Claire wasn&#39;t a werewolf, if Ryan might be okay with her having some fun with Bob at pride meetings since he wasn&#39;t a weretiger. That would be something to work out in the future. For the moment, her plan was to essentially cement her relationship with Ryan and claim him as HERS. <br />
<br />
She loosely put the robe she had been given back on and began to walk back toward the parking area, where she could see Ryan sitting patiently in his car. At the moment he looked like he he was on the phone, and she was amazed at how good her senses had become. Bob walked with her they moved to the car. As they made it back to the parking area, she saw Bob head toward his own vehicle. He gave her a wave as he did so. Claire gave a small smile and waved back and approached Ryan&#39;s car with her things in her hands and with her new E cup breasts sitting proud on her chest. She reached out with one hand while holding the rest of her clothes to her and tapped on the window.<br />
<br />
Ryan had been trying to wait patiently. He wished Claire would have become a werewolf and let him welcome her, but he loved her and it wouldn&#39;t matter what kind of were she was so long as she loved him. It was odd in that sense when he thought about it. When they first met not only was she a Normal, but she was technically on the wrong side of the law with regard to Moon Lake&#39;s secrets. But he could see that seeing the youngest Anderson boy and his new girlfriend together had truly frightened her out of her mind. Technically, the town could have forced Claire to change, but that wouldn&#39;t have helped matters. Sure she might become a were and wouldn&#39;t blab the secret for her own safety, but that wouldn&#39;t have meant she would have fully accepted it or would have been glad about it. And since the town tried to make sure that Normals moving to Moon Lake were given the chance to choose what to become, it made sense for Claire to get the same option and see that Moon Lake&#39;s weres weren&#39;t the mindless monsters from movies  or some dark secret society from conspiracy theories.<br />
<br />
He was so focused on his own thoughts that he almost jumped as a shadow came over his side of the car and there was a tap on the window. He turned and looked over to find that it was Claire, though obviously now different from before. Her base scent was the same. The scent that identified her as Claire was still there, but the normal human scent was gone. Instead, Ryan caught the scent of a very aroused tigress coming from her. Her clothing, purse, and other belongings were in her hands as she looked to Ryan and as she leaned down toward him. She was wearing nothing but a robe that the present leader of the weretigers had given her, but it was also hanging open to give Ryan a good view of the large orbs that were her breasts and the prominent muscles that had developed with them. When they&#39;d first met, Ryan knew that he had the raw power to restrain her easily. Now, Claire was likely physically stronger than him, as she was a tigress, and Ryan&#39;s only advantage was his police training. Though, the sort of wrestling Ryan had actually been think off was more designed to give her orgasms, NOT restrain her. And by the arousal that was in her own scent, it was clear what she had on her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there,&quot; Claire said to him through the window, &quot;thanks for waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I would,&quot; Ryan managed.<br />
<br />
Claire smiled, &quot;I&#39;m a were now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I can smell that,&quot; Ryan answered, &quot;Happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very,&quot; Claire smiled playfully, &quot;but there is something that I would like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Ryan wondered, though again based on her scent, he had a good idea. &quot;Any idea what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That we go &quot;home&quot; and introduce your wolf to my tigress,&quot; Claire gave a very playful smile and gave a shake of her chest, making her bosom bounce and sway in front of him, &quot;and go until we can&#39;t go anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan watched her continued to smile in a way that betrayed confidence, playfulness, and even real love at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can keep up with you now,&quot; Claire smiled, &quot;I can feel it... and you don&#39;t have to worry about hurting me. However you know where your upper limit is. I want to find mine... and get your knot in me as we grow and change together... and by your scent... I&#39;d say your interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan managed a smile back. He knew he loved Claire, found her beautiful, even in her normal form, but now, between her E cup breasts, firm muscles, wide hips, and the obvious scent of arousal, Claire was getting a very firm reaction out of him. He wasn&#39;t in his wolven form, but inside his pants, his penis was erect and trying to push its way out of his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m more than interested,&quot; Ryan gave a smile back, &quot;I love you Claire... It&#39;s odd... given how short we&#39;ve known each other... but I love you and want you to be happy. Happy as a person... as a were, regardless of whether it had been wolf or tiger... and happy with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire smiled and walked around the car opened the back door and placed her clothing and purse in it before climbing into passenger seat beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let us go home,&quot; Claire said to him, &quot;and love each other as much as we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan smiled and started the car.</p>
