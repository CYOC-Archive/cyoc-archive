<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mwahohohoho,&quot; echoed in Jake's ears as he bounced off his bed and through the translucent wall and into <br />
Jeremy's room.<br />
<br />
He landed on all fours.  His hands were in locked leather mitts, he had knee pads on his knees, and the butt <br />
plug tail up his ass really hurt since he had landed on it when he hit his bed and bounced. Next to him there <br />
was big white box with black polka dots and a ribbon around it with a black ribbon with white polka dots. A <br />
tag on it said, &quot;For Jeremy, From Santa&quot;.  There was a similar tag hanging from the spiked leather collar <br />
hanging around Jakey's neck.  He sat there looking expectantly at sleeping Jeremy.  His tongue hung out of his <br />
mouth, he was Jeremy's bitch now, and he knew it. His past prejudices still existed in a corner of his mind, <br />
but they had no control over him.  All they did was exist to torture himself.  Santa's vengeance created a <br />
living hell for Jake.  He could only hope and pray that his afterlife would be better for his reformed <br />
behavior.<br />
<br />
Jeremy's alarm went off at 4:30 am.  He needed to be at the pool by 5:30 am to do his laps.  He practically <br />
freaked when he saw latex covered Jake kneeling by his tiny Christmas tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, where's the hidden camera?&quot; were the first words out of Jeremy's mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Merry Christmas, Master Jeremy!&quot; Jake said brightly. Followed by, &quot;Oops, I mean, bow-wow, bow-wow!&quot; And he <br />
went back to all fours vigorously wagging his tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if you have a hidden camera, Jake, this has got to be worse for you than me.  Did you think this <br />
through?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake nodded vigorously while still shaking his tail. Then he nudged the box toward Jeremy with his forehead.<br />
<br />
Jeremy standing at arm's length carefully pulled the end of the ribbon.  Then he lifted the lid off the box <br />
opening it toward Jake in case a pie was set to launch.  No explosion, no pie, just a bunch of stuff, with a <br />
letter on top.<br />
<br />
He opened the letter and read in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Jeremy,<br />
<br />
Jake has been naughty.<br />
<br />
You have been nice.<br />
<br />
I have shown Jake the error of his ways.  His bad behavior toward you was due to his secret desire to serve <br />
you as your dog slave.  He has been closeted for years, and in love with you since he first met.  You may <br />
choose to keep him as your boyfriend, but he'll always be your dog slave unless you decide to sell him to <br />
someone else. His pink slip is enclosed.<br />
<br />
The stuff in the box should help you train your new puppy.<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas,<br />
<br />
Signed Santa Claus&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeremy looked at Jake and back at the letter. He found the pink slip which was a brief one page &quot;Ownership <br />
Certificate&quot; signed by Jake giving himself totally to Jeremy to use as he saw fit or to sell him.  Inside the <br />
box there were two silver dog bowls (one for water, one for food), a leash, a riding crop, a training manual, <br />
a rolled up newspaper, a collapsible pooper scooper with attached baggie dispenser, a muzzle/hood shaped like <br />
a dog's head in white leather with black spots,  a ball, a frisbee, six bottles of black and white latex, and <br />
two t-shirts.  The first t-shirt was a small and was black and had white letters on it that read &quot;OWNER&quot;.  The <br />
second one was a large white t-shirt with black letters that read, &quot;owned.&quot;  Jeremy was an XS usually, but he <br />
was still growing, Jake wore an XL normally, so the Large would be skintight on him.  There was little <br />
brochure about how to tattoo your dog slave permanently except for his face, neck and hands, so he could still <br />
get a decent job outside the home to pay for its upkeep.  Jeremy laughed. <br />
<br />
He looked down at Jake who was sitting back on his haunches with a major boner between his legs. Inside Jake <br />
was screaming at himself and thinking of sports stats, but to no effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you really do want to be my boyfriend.  I'd love to play with you right now, but I have to get <br />
breakfast, and then go do laps,&quot; Jeremy said patting his new dog's head.<br />
<br />
It was weird.  Jake had made his life hell.  Had he really been just trying to get Jeremy's attention?  He had <br />
succeeded alright.  He frowned. He had mixed feelings. He did find both the situation and Jake hot, but he <br />
secretly feared it was a prank of some sort.  He sighed, and changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stop being my dog, and get dressed, if you want to take me to breakfast for a real date,&quot; Jeremy <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A real date?  Oh, that'd be great. Thank you, Jeremy.  Uh, would you like to go to the iHOP or the Denny's?  <br />
I'd take you somewhere else, but I think they're the only ones open 24 hours,&quot; Jake said getting to his feet <br />
for the first time since Santa had changed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pancakes sounds good and the IHOP's on the way to the gym,&quot; Jeremy said peeling off his t-shirt. He didn't <br />
want to get naked in front of Jake yet.  Jake may have been naked, but the latex paint seemed to make hims <br />
seem less naked even as his red latex covered cock cracked.  The foreskin was black and white, but his cock <br />
head and portion under the foreskin was coated with red latex. <br />
<br />
Jake headed to the door to the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going out there naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right, uh, I don't have any pants here. Do you have some shorts I could borrow, Jeremy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do better than that. How good a swimmer are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Speedo sent me an assortment free swimwear but they didn't verify my size first. Most of it was too big <br />
for me, but I think some of it might fit you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wearing a Speedo one size too big for Jeremy, but two sizes too small for Jake, Jake scampered across the hall <br />
to his room.  Damn, he had locked his door, and Santa hadn't left it unlocked.  Then he remembered that he had <br />
cracked his window next to the fire escape. So he dashed down the hall, and up the stairs to the roof.  He ran <br />
over to the fire escape on his side of the building in the freezing air and shimmied down the fire escape to <br />
his room. He lifted the window and climbed in.<br />
<br />
He opened his closet and blinked. Half his wardrobe had changed. He picked a long-sleeved pink shirt and khaki <br />
pants and white socks and Hush Puppy suede shoes. Then he put his wallet and keys in his pocket, and went <br />
across the hall to pick up Jeremy for his date.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look great, Jeremy,&quot; Jake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look pretty good yourself,&quot; Jeremy said cautiously, &quot;You want to go swimming with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure - but I've still got my latex paint on under this,&quot; Jake said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay. I put one of those full body Speedos in my bag, its a large, so it might fit tight. You know <br />
like Phelps wore at the Olympics?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's great. Let's go get pancakes!&quot; Jake said taking the bag from Jeremy and putting his arm lovingly <br />
over smaller Jeremy's shoulders.<br />
<br />
Jake felt a warm feeling flush through body. It was good to be with Jeremy.  They entered the elevator. Jeremy <br />
put his arm around Jake, and reached down to goose him.  He laughed hysterically.<br />
<br />
&quot;You forgot to remove your butt plug!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my, so I did!&quot; Jake said blushing. He loosened his belt and reached in the back of his waistband, and <br />
pulled it out with a moan. He held it awkwardly in front of him as they exited the elevator. He stopped at his <br />
mailbox and put it inside, and locked it up. He grinned, &quot;Looks like I'll have a special delivery waiting for <br />
me when I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake walked a bit awkwardly out to his car, and let Jeremy into the passenger side holding the BMW's door. He <br />
then went around and drove to the IHOP. Jeremy couldn't help but notice that Jake's pants were tented for most <br />
of the trip, but then so were his own.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, just down the street Tim Zucher was waking up to find the treat Santa had left him.<br />
<br />
Tim was a big dude.  He was a star athlete. He stood 6'3&quot; and weight 290 lb. He was big everywhere except one <br />
place.  Ever since peewee baseball, he had been ridiculed and teased because of his tiny cock.  His nickname <br />
tiny sounded like a joke about his height, but it was a comment about his cock size.  He was only 4 inches <br />
when erect.  He had tried penis pumps. The vacuum did make it seem bigger in the tube, but it shrank back when <br />
removed. He had thought about surgery, but hadn't pursued it. He kept hoping that his cock would grow a bit <br />
more.<br />
<br />
James Hanover was the worst at teasing Tim.  He had known Tim since high school, where they shared a gym <br />
locker one season because the locker room was being renovated and half the lockers were gone. James had been <br />
endowed with a seven incher.  Rubber Santa had also decided that James was on the naughty list.<br />
<br />
Tim stared at James standing naked at the foot of his bed next to the Christmas stocking hanging from the foot  <br />
board.  James was clad only in a big red bow with a tag that read, &quot;FUCK MY ASS HARD.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're serious?&quot; Tiny queried. He frowned.  There was something terribly erotic about the situation which did <br />
make his little cock rock hard. &quot;You know I'm not gay,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither am I,&quot; blurted out James, &quot;But we both have to do this. Santa said so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm serious. Please, Tim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim? Not Tiny Tim?  I think this is the first time since 9th grade that you called me just Tim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that, Tim.  After today, nobody will ever call you Tiny and mean it the way we used to,&quot; James <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're kidding right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I set up the video camera there. You can record this. Just push the red button.  I can see your morning <br />
wood needs attention, so please use me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay? You brought condoms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you won't need any, Tim.  I'm clean, drug free, std free and I gave myself 3 enemas earlier,&quot; James <br />
answered.  He almost said that he didn't think it would work if he used a condom. Fortunately, Tim was really <br />
horny and he didn't have any condoms. Turned out because of his tiny cock, Tim was still a virgin. James <br />
wasn't a virgin when it came to his dick, but when it came to his ass he was one too.<br />
<br />
Against his better judgment, Tim took the plunge. He found sex was incredible. The harder he fucked James' <br />
ass, the bigger his cock felt inside James. It was only when he tried to pull out and found that he couldn't, <br />
did Tim realize that James was changing.<br />
<br />
James had known what to expect and he was terrified. Rubber Santa had explained it all very carefully to him.<br />
<br />
James was going to become a big cock whether or not Tim fucked him.  If no one was fucking him, then he would <br />
simply end up a dildo for sale in a gay adult bookstore.  If Tim fucked him then he would add seven inches to <br />
Tim's 4.5 inches.  If he went had had anyone else fuck him, he'd add 14 inches to their cock turning them into <br />
freaks.  If he was a dildo, he would still be sentient, but he would never feel an orgasm again.  If he was a <br />
living cock, he would experience orgasms whenever his owner did.  Of course a guy with 18 inch or bigger cock <br />
would rarely get any action, so his best chance was being Tiny Tim's cock.<br />
<br />
He braced his hands on his knees and felt fire in his rosebud as Tim penetrated him. The fire intensified as <br />
his flesh melted to fuse with Tim's.  James could feel himself shrinking around Tim's cock. His body hair and <br />
head hair was absorbed into his body.  By the time Tim noticed that something was happening, James was a four <br />
foot tall hairless bald guy with just holes in his head for his nose and earlobes.  The fleshing parts were <br />
all gone.<br />
<br />
Tim couldn't help himself from saying as he saw their reflection in the mirror, &quot;Hey, you know if they ever <br />
make an Austin Powers-Harry Potter crossover movie, James, you can play mini-Voldemort.&quot;  Indeed, that is what <br />
he looked like at that point. By the time Tim bad blown two more loads, James was just his new big cock. Tim <br />
was pleasantly surprised to see his balls swell and drop to be proportional to his new cock.  By the time, Jim <br />
was flaccid, Tim had already stopped thinking of him as James. <br />
<br />
Tim dressed, and decided he needed to invest in underwear with a skoosh more room. He felt a lot more <br />
confident. By noon, he would already have a date with Jim's former girlfriend Kelle, who no longer remembered <br />
that Jim had ever existed.  That night when she said she wanted to see Tiny Tim, and fingered Tim's lap, he <br />
had told her that his cock wasn't Tiny Tim, but was Big Jim.<br />
<br />
She chuckled and went on to give Tiny Tim and Big Jim the best sex either had ever had.  The origin story for <br />
Tiny Tim's name turned into a joke because his cock was so big compared to everyone else's that they called <br />
him Tiny.<br />
<br />
Of course, long before Tiny Tim had awakened to find his gift, Rubber Santa had gone on to another naughty <br />
boy's home to collect him for a nice boy on his list.  Santa paused as he looked at his list.  There were many <br />
more naughties than nice, which boded well for next year, but there were two naughties at this current <br />
address, and the next nice had been especially good this year. So Santa bracketed the names of the two young <br />
men living at Delta Omicron Gamma house, and put a star next to Chris's name he would be getting both Naughty <br />
boys in his Christmas stocking.<br />
<br />
Now Santa stood in front of the frat house sofa on which slumped the two drunken boys who would be Chris' <br />
gift. It had only been moments since he had left Jeremy's bedroom, but time moved differently around Santa <br />
Claus. He stood there and looked at the naughty list. Instantly the ink on the paper shifted to open like a <br />
computer window to display the litany of the miscreants' misdeeds. Santa pursed his lips. Chris could use <br />
several things in pairs, now which would be suitable punishment?  He could turn them into a bitch and stud <br />
breeder dogs, or a pair of socks or a pair of those Vibram Five Toe rubber shoes or maybe a jockstrap with a <br />
cup insert for Karate class or maybe...<br />
<br />
Then he smiled having made his decision, he said loudly, &quot;Mwhohohohoho!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike and Jeff opened their eyes.  They saw the red clad muscled hunk with the huge tented crotch looming over <br />
them. Then they saw that they had fallen asleep in each others arms with their drooling faces pressed <br />
together. They immediately sat upright and moved to opposite ends of the sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're hoping no one saw you like that?  Ho, ho, wait until they see how you're going to be!&quot; Santa <br />
laughed.  The frat house was silent except for Santa's robust voice.<br />
<br />
Mike was the first to notice how wrong the silence was.  He shouted, &quot;Hey who sent the Santa in here?&quot; There <br />
were a lot of guys in the frat house, but no one answered since they were all frozen in time and couldn't <br />
hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two have been very naughty...&quot; Santa began.  He would list the highlights of their recent naughtiness, <br />
and then he would explain what they would become for Chris Stevenson.  Mike would ask who the hell Chris was <br />
and Santa would tell him...</p>
