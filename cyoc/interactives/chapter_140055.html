<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus, Sam and James were still 12 years old although they looked older. They were wearing just diapers and they seemed happy about it. Well, except Marcus who was still adapting to this new reality.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m done.&quot; James said as he came out from the bathroom. &quot;Your turn, Marcus.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh, I think I&#39;m fine.&quot; Marcus hesitated. For some reason, he didn&#39;t want to shave.<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; James replied. &quot;But if you don&#39;t shave you&#39;ll grow a beard like Bob Patinski.&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; Sam replied. &quot;Bob Patinski has that beard because he has never shaved, that&#39;s at least 2 years of growing it!&quot;<br />
&quot;He&#39;s 14...&quot; James said.<br />
&quot;And he has never shaved!&quot; Sam said. &quot;Come on, Marcus. Don&#39;t worry, if you want a beard, that&#39;s ok!&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want a...&quot; Marcus tried to reply but he was interrupted when he heard a trumpet sound. His mind told him it&#39;s the principal&#39;s call. &quot;We should go to the main hall.&quot;<br />
&quot;You could get troubles if the principal sees you didn&#39;t shave.&quot; James said.<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have time.&quot; Sam said. &quot;Just don&#39;t let the principal sees you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three guys left the cabin and after walking a while, Marcus realized that they didn&#39;t use shoes nor clothing. They were walking over ground and rocks but it wasn&#39;t painful. He looked at their feet and they wondered how big they were in this reality.<br />
&quot;I need to piss.&quot; Marcus said as a toddler would say it and he felt ashamed of that.<br />
&quot;And why do you tell us?&quot; Sam replied. &quot;Pee in your diaper!&quot;<br />
Marcus remember he was wearing a diaper nonetheless he&#39;s still ashamed of peeing like a baby. He tried to hold it up but soon he realized he has no control on his bladder and he was pissing all the way to the main hall.<br />
When they arrived, Marcus was surprised to see so many people. On the right, there were just girls, who apparently looked the same as in the other reality. However, the boys who were on the left, looked like college dudes in diapers. They didn&#39;t interact between each other as Marcus realized that they didn&#39;t have interest about the opposite gender.<br />
He, Sam and James joined the boys group and waited for the principal arrival. He wondered how big and hairy some of these guys were abd they&#39;re just between  12 and 14 years old.<br />
&quot;The principal.&quot; Sam said. &quot;Marcus, get behind me.&quot;<br />
Marcus obeyed before he&#39;s seen by the imposing man that was coming in. Marcus was astounded of how big and virile he looked. Muscles on every part of his body and rugs of hair that weren&#39;t hiding under any clothes because he was wearing just diapers, huge diapers which looked obscenely tight on him.<br />
&quot;Good morning, ladies.&quot; His voice boomed like a cannon through the hall. &quot;Good morning, boys. Today we have an expedition to the mountains and we&#39;re going in couples.&quot; The people happily cheered after hearing that but they quickly stopped when the principal kept speaking. &quot;But, we&#39;re going to do it in boy and girl couples.&quot; The kids looked disappointed. &quot;You know that our society relies on cooperation between men and women. Men have the strength to face anything but they can&#39;t take care of themselves, so women have to use their brain and cunning to kept them both safe.&quot;<br />
&quot;Is he implying we&#39;re brutes muscleheads?&quot; Marcus whispered to Sam but he was heard by the principal.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not implying, mr. Johnson. It&#39;s a biological fact.&quot; The principal told him. &quot;But if you feel offended by that, come here and prove me wrong.&quot;<br />
Marcus reluctantly obeyed and went next to the principal. He looked even more imposing at that distance and Marcus can smell a strong musk coming from him.<br />
&quot;If you are so smart. You can solve this.&quot; The principal raised his arms and then... he hid his face behind his hands. &quot;Where I am?&quot;<br />
Marcus thought it was stupid but when he tried to answer he realized that he didn&#39;t know it. The principal wasn&#39;t there, that&#39;s what the only thing that his mind told him. He looked around but he just saw all the other guys concerned and the girls giggling.<br />
&quot;The principal has disappeared!&quot; He panicked. &quot;He was here a second ago!!&quot;<br />
After several seconds, the principal took his hands off and said. &quot;You dumbass! I never left! That&#39;s a little trick that you&#39;ll learn when you&#39;re older. Now, go back to your place. I&#39;ll talk with you later about your shaving...&quot;<br />
Marcus returned with his friends confused. He knew it was stupid but he can&#39;t understand how he didn&#39;t know that the principal was there all the time.<br />
&quot;Ok, guys.&quot; The principal&#39;s voice boomed again. &quot;I&#39;ll define the couples now. David Wilson and Sarah Miller...&quot;<br />
He kept speaking until all the boys and girls were coupled. Sam and James were paired with the Campbell twins and had left the hall. He was the among the last ones.<br />
&quot;And Carlos Mendes with Jessica Murray.&quot; The principal said before that couple left thr hall. Now, Marcus was alone with the principal. &quot;It looks like we have a boy more than girls. It seems you&#39;re going with me, Johnson.&quot; Marcus gulped when he saw the huge man approaching to him. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m skilled to cover the basic woman&#39;s abilities but you would have to change my diapers.&quot; The principal said as he patted Marcus&#39; back. &quot;Now, let&#39;s pack some diapers. I use extra extra large because extra extra extra large are hard to find. What size are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Large.&quot; Marcus replied although he didn&#39;t know he was.<br />
&quot;Hohoho!! You&#39;re still a kid!!&quot; The principal laughed. &quot;I remember when I wore large diapers, but that was decades ago! Don&#39;t worry, boy. You&#39;ll continue growing!! Hahaha!!!&quot;<br />
Marcus was terrified of what he heard. Does that means that he could get as big as this man in this reality? He watched at himself and looked how big he was now. Big sturdy arms and thick hairy legs. But what terrified him even more was how dumb he was now like a toddler in his former reality.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be just muscles with no brain!&quot; Marcus shouted to himself but the principal heard it.<br />
&quot;All the kids say the same at first but they forget about it quickly when they grow older and their muscles develop.&quot; The principal said. &quot;You seem that you can grow a lot yet. So, I won&#39;t surprise if we can share diapers in a few years! Haha!!&quot;</p>
