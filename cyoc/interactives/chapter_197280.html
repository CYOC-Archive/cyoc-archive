<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Neil extricated himself from the sheets as usual. Being a big bodybuilder kind of guy now, he also happened to sweat like fuck when he slept, so he peeled the sheets off the bed to wash and then put some new ones on there. He swore, it seemed like Max and Clara were going at it even when he fell asleep! He wiped the sleep off his face and headed into the bathroom to clean up. A short shower later, and Neil examined himself. Heavily muscled as usual - nowhere near as huge as Brock, but definitely a physique competitor. He flexed a bicep, and remembered himself doing front double bi at a conference just a year ago for an adoring crowd...just the same as he remembered that very same day, he&#39;d been hanging out with Max and commiserating about Matt and company being miserable to know at the time.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it seemed rather than one set of memories slowly replacing the other, like what seemed to happen with the others, he could still maintain his former set of memories, while recalling the new ones just as well. What he needed to remember, going into today, was that he didn&#39;t know if this was intentional or not. So if whoever was responsible for this - and this was too directed to be an incidental effect - didn&#39;t intend it, he might end up getting a mental invasion for his troubles if he should be too forward in his investigations.<br />
<br />
There was also the matter of Neil&#39;s changes so far.<br />
<br />
It seemed like his desires for muscle and fitness shaped how he changed, even when he changed outside the gym when he had sex with someone from it. Even as Neil felt a stirring in his groin, he tried to ignore it - thinking about what happened...while trying to keep from getting too erotic about it. He didn&#39;t want to waste his morning hours in a nonstop wank. &quot;Well, it seems whatever&#39;s going on,&quot; he contemplated outloud, &quot;When I did it with Clarissa, nothing happened. When I did it with Parker, who trained there all of one day, it activated and I changed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking about watching his forearms grow somewhat more muscular still got him chubbed up. Neil groaned and tried to calm himself down, thinking about things like baseball, doing his tax returns, and student loan debt...and that did it. He breathed and got dressed for the day.<br />
<br />
Neil this time found himself dressing in a red stringer tank top, the scoop low and baring the top of his sculpted abs, and the back consisting of only a few strings that ran over his broad shoulders, and one running up the middle of his back. His black shorts were shorter looking than they really were due to his leg development, and hugged his ass at the back.<br />
<br />
As Neil went down to enjoy some food, he wondered if there would be more changed on Max. <br />
<br />
Considering changes seemed to occur when Neil had sex, he pondered if the same token would apply when Max had sex. He could hear the blender going, as it seemed Max had taken up the idea of making protein mix drinks to have with his breakfast. As Neil breathed and headed down, he was greeted by the sight of a shirtless Max wearing only a pair of tight workout pants, idly humming a tune as he made his drink. Neil almost felt himself whistle appreciatively, but held back on that.<br />
<br />
Though it did look like Max hadn&#39;t changed at all there was still much to appreciate.<br />
<br />
Max still somewhat retained his stockier look to a degree, but more in the direction of being a thick set, in training bodybuilder himself. His thick waist was something Neil for some reason had a degree of memory of being a problem for him. Most of Max was impressively muscled and toned, with only his abs being slightly puffy as a sort of reminiscence of his earlier state. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, good morning!&quot; Neil said as he approached, &quot;Smells like some protein this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta get my day started off right,&quot; Max responded, &quot;...by the by, sorry if we kept you up. Fuck, she was insatiable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil and Max both chuckled - the idea they were now one or the other keeping someone up due to sheer volume of sexual experience almost seemed funny. With both able to remember how things were, Neil and Max simply fistbumped and remembered when they could barely maintain any interest from the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;You hitting the gym today, big man?&quot; Max asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today&#39;s mostly a rest day. I&#39;ll be heading down to Brock&#39;s private gym to help him out with a light lift.&quot; Neil shrugged, knowing from experience - at least, the new experience - that not maintaining a rest day schedule was a fast way to pull a muscle with the kind of dietary shifts and requirements he maintained. The lift at Brock&#39;s place would be light, but just good enough to maintain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same, honestly,&quot; Max chuckled, &quot;Clara asked me out today after we got done...uh, last night...&quot; Max ran a hand through his hair, &quot;She wants to go hiking up in the hills. You&#39;re free to come along if you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiking up in the hills with you guys? Count me in!&quot; Neil then looked down. He saw Max&#39;s muscled ass stuck out a bit as he leaned forward, the blender still going with his protein drink. Neil felt tempted...so he went for it, to see how Max might respond. Besides, here he was like this. &quot;Is that how you keep your ass all muscled up like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil playfully smacked Max&#39;s ass with his hand, and owing to the fact Max was going on six days now at the gym, his response kind of thrilled Neil. The moment his hand made contact, Max froze up. His lip quivered, and his muscles tensed up. Neil swore he could just almost hear the &quot;SPROING&quot; as Max&#39;s cock visibly tented in his pants. The less experienced bodybuilder finally could hold it in no longer - he let out a pleased moan as a blush colored his face tomato red for a moment.<br />
<br />
Max visibly quivered from the sensation, but quickly retained his composure. &quot;D-Dude what was THAT?&quot; He chuckled somewhat awkwardly. &quot;You know I&#39;ve been working glutes, that shit gets me way too sensitive!&quot; Max outright openly adjusted the bulge at the front of his pants, gulping and rolling his shoulders forward and then back as his hand made contact with his sensitive cock.<br />
<br />
Before long, Neil was himself thinking about the fact this had all so quickly turned so homoerotic.<br />
<br />
Max glanced at Neil in a curious if somewhat naive way. It was very clear from that that Neil doing that had incited some sort of response, an erotic one, in Max that the lifter wasn&#39;t quite familiar with. Max was definitely turned on by the advance, but he was not exactly aware yet of where his sexuality resided. Just that he quite liked the touch.<br />
<br />
For a moment, both Neil and Max stared at each other. &quot;Dude...&quot; Max murmured, &quot;...Never felt quite like that before...&quot; Max then contemplated, &quot;Could this be something related to like, the gym or something...? All the changes we&#39;re going through. Did it also include like, our sexualities or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
For his part, Neil contemplated what to do next.<br />
<br />
He was very much a bisexual bodybuilder at this rate, and he had the raging libido to match. Max wasn&#39;t quite progressed that far yet, but it was clear by the way Max was moving closer to him that he was at least curious. Neil knew if he made the move from here that likely he and Max would probably end up in a sexual episode. And going by what happened it seemed whenever Neil had sex with a guy from the gym, both would likely end up changing in some physical fashion.<br />
<br />
It was entirely in Neil&#39;s power to just call it off.<br />
<br />
To move back, re-evaluate, and try and control himself. He didn&#39;t want to push Max along further like he&#39;d done with Brock...at least, he didn&#39;t think so. Brock as of now seemed caught between the end point and the beginning point. Max...was much earlier along in this.<br />
<br />
Or... Neil found himself contemplating the idea of an experiment with the kind of physical changes he could incite in himself. It seemed like whatever magic this was, it was influenced by the desires, fixations and self conception of the person affected by it. Matt was so wrapped up in femininity that it seemed to make him more the effete pretty boy less the jock. <br />
<br />
Brock had become an older man, likely because he had some idea in his head about steroids making you look older or something. Enough to incite a fixation...and thus a transformation.<br />
<br />
Lucas was easy enough. He looked up to that black bodybuilder he&#39;d been training with, intensely enough that he was now it seemed starting to turn very readily well...into a black man. Was there no limit to what this magic was capable of...? Well, that last one gave Neil a bit of an idea for his experiment. He wondered how many changes were necessary to affect a transformation in any particular direction. He knew it took a while for Brock to end up like in his late fifties or early sixties physically as he was now. <br />
<br />
So...for the experiment...if Neil went ahead with the experiment at all... he decided to try something. He remembered hearing about some big time Korean bodybuilder that had a pretty insane physique. So that gave him an idea. Should Neil go ahead with this, he&#39;d think about Korea and muscle while going forward with sex. It&#39;d be...kind of weird. But it&#39;d let him know if the changes could go in that direction on someone&#39;s own initiative.<br />
<br />
So thus, Neil...</p>
