<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the day seemed to go by in a flash, and before Alex knew it, the sun was already beginning to set. Of course, the young man knew that his activities with Orion weren’t done just yet. The werewolf had been going on almost all day about how the full moon was tonight, and how he wanted to spend the night celebrating with Alex. The two of them had just stopped at Mythos to pick up some dinner to go, as Orion was insistent on the two of them making it to the cliff the two of them had visited the night prior before the moon rose. Thankfully, they had some time to kill, so the two of them were able to calmly walk there this time. <br />
<br />
“So…about this ‘full moon gathering’ that you’ve been going on about,” Alex said, looking over at Orion as the duo walked down the cobblestone street. “I thought that werewolves weren’t tied to the full moon.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, we aren’t,” Orion replied. “The full moon allows us to become better connected to our emotions and bond as packmates. In the ancient times, these gatherings were very sacred, as they helped prevent werewolves from ‘going feral’, if you will.” <br />
<br />
“What do you mean by ‘going feral’?” Alex asked curiously. <br />
<br />
Orion scratched the back of his head. “It’s…a bit hard to explain…” he said, shifting the bag with the wine bottles he had bought during their visit to Tityroi Winery earlier that day. “Packs help werewolves stay grounded and in sync with their emotions. Without a pack, a werewolf feels incomplete. In ancient times, this loneliness drove some werewolves insane. Nowadays however, werewolves aren’t at much of a risk of going insane like they used to be thanks to them being able to function in modern day society with friends and family. It’s a bit confusing, I know…”<br />
<br />
“Still doesn’t make it any less interesting,” Alex commented, making the other man smile. <br />
<br />
The pair arrived at the cliff a few minutes before the sun set. Orion set down the bag containing the wine and wine glasses before sitting down in the grass. Alex set down the bag he’d been carrying their food in and sat down next to Orion, getting their food out as Orion opened the bottle of wine and began to pour two wine glasses. Alex noticed this and grimaced. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m not old enough to drink yet,” the young man said. <br />
<br />
Orion simply laughed and shook his head. “You’re not old enough to drink <i>in America</i>, &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” the man said. “In Greece, you need to be at least 18 years old to drink alcohol, so you’re able to have a glass! And even if the age limit was higher, we could just keep it between us.” The older man held out a full glass to Alex, and the younger man hesitantly accepted. Orion proceeded to pick up his own glass and hold it up. <br />
<br />
“Cheers!” he said enthusiastically, clinking his glass against Alex’s before the two of them began to drink. As soon as the liquid hit Alex’s tongue, a look of disgust appeared on his face, making Orion laugh. <br />
<br />
“Never had an alcoholic drink before, have you?” he asked, taking another sip of his wine. <br />
<br />
“It’s…uh…much different than what I expected…” Alex said, trying to get the taste out of his mouth. “Guess it just takes some getting used to.”<br />
<br />
“It does,” the other man said with a chuckle. The two of them remained silent for a minute, listening to the sounds of nature around them. Eventually, Alex broke that silence. <br />
<br />
“Orion…today’s been a lot of fun…” the young man said. “I’ve really enjoyed spending time with you.”<br />
<br />
“I have too, &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” Orion responded. “Although it’s only been a day, I feel like there’s a…connection…between us.”<br />
<br />
“A connection?” Alex repeated. <br />
<br />
The older man scratched the back of his head nervously. “I want to get to know you better, Alex,” he said. “I’ve never felt this way about anyone before, human or werewolf. I know that you’ll only be here until the end of the summer, but perhaps we could give this…give <i>us</i>…a try?”<br />
<br />
Alex was quiet for a moment as he processed what Orion had asked him. Did the guy who he’d just met yesterday ask if they could try dating? A part of him wanted to say no and shut all of this down right here, right now. But at the same time, he couldn’t help but think back to what Eric had said a few hours earlier. He had met the love of his life when he was on a vacation just like this one, as well as his brother, father, and mother. Was it really that much of a stretch to think that the same thing could happen to him? <br />
<br />
“This…this is all happening so fast, Orion…” Alex said quietly. “We only just met yesterday, and now you’re asking me if you want to start dating? It’s a bit crazy, don’t you think?”<br />
<br />
“Oh…” Orion broke eye contact and hung his head low. “Yeah…it is a bit crazy. I’m sorry for making things awkward…” The man was suddenly caught off guard by Alex wrapping his arm around him. <br />
<br />
“But…” Alex said softly, resting his head on Orion’s shoulder. “I like a bit of crazy from time to time…”<br />
<br />
Surprised, Orion turned his head towards Alex. “Wait, does that mean you…?” The younger man laughed and planted a kiss on Orion’s cheek, making the older man blush. He proceeded to wrap his arm around Alex, holding the young man close to him. After a few minutes, Orion removed his arm from around Alex and began to stand up, much to Alex’s confusion. <br />
<br />
“Is something wrong, Orion?“ Alex asked, looking at the other man with confusion. Orion shook his head and smiled. <br />
<br />
“No, nothing’s wrong &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” the man said. “I’m just going into the forest behind us to transform real fast. I’ll be right back, okay?” Orion began to stand up, but Alex quickly grabbed his wrist and stopped him. <br />
<br />
“Wait…Orion…” the young man said. “Could you maybe…let me watch you transform?” Orion’s eyes widened and his face turned beet red, which made Alex worried that he shouldn’t have asked that. Was it some unspoken taboo for werewolves to transform in front of humans?<br />
<br />
“You…want me to change…in front of you…?” Orion asked. “You know that I have to get…naked…right?”<br />
<br />
“I-I figured you’d have to…” Alex admitted, his face turning red from embarrassment. “It’s just that…ever since I saw the resort’s PR representative transform on the metro ride, I’ve found myself wanting to see more transformations. Maybe it’s because I’m still nervous about transforming myself and seeing it happen to other people helps to alleviate that nervousness, or maybe it’s because the idea of a human turning into something else has always fascinated me. Whatever the case may be, seeing you transform from human to wolf is something that I want to see with my own eyes.”<br />
<br />
Orion hesitated for a second, but he nodded in understanding. “Alright,” he said, turning around completely to face Alex. “I’ll do it.” The man began to undress, taking off his shoes, socks, and tank top. After setting his shirt to the side, Orion slowly took off his shorts, setting them to the side with the rest of his clothes. <br />
<br />
“Alright…I’m going to start changing now &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” the man said. “Watch carefully.” The man closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths before sliding his underwear down, revealing his semi-erect cock. Alex found himself blushing as he gazed upon the handsome, muscular man in front of him, namely at his growing erection.<br />
<br />
“Orion…” Alex began. “Could I…give you a handjob while you change?”<br />
<br />
Orion’s eyes widened, but he nodded in agreement, much to Alex’s surprise. The young man stood up and moved closer to Orion. Once he was close enough, he dropped to his knees so he was eye level with the man’s cock. Alex grabbed Orion’s cock, earning a slight moan of pleasure from the older man. Seeing that as a sign to start, Alex slowly began to jack off Orion’s cock. <br />
<br />
As Orion moaned in pleasure, his feet began to elongate, growing narrower as his toes fused together into four digits. As black paw pads grew in on the bottoms of his feet, Orion’s heels began to rise off the ground, his feet reshaping into a digitigrade structure. <br />
<br />
White fur soon began to sprout over Orion’s body, quickly covering his paws and legs. His fingernails began to lengthen and darken, turning into claws as black pads grew in on his hands. <br />
<br />
“F-Fuck…you’re doing great &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;…” Orion said, panting. “But get ready…for the best part…” Before Alex could ask what he meant, the transforming male threw his head back and cried out in pleasure. The younger man then felt Orion’s cock begin to grow thicker around the base. Alex watched in awe as Orion’s cock grew longer, and the flesh began to turn a red hue. A rather thick knot grew in at the base of the transforming man’s cock, giving it a distinctly canine appearance. As the head of the cock began to taper out into a point, the young man felt compelled to give it a lick or two.<br />
<br />
Without warning, Alex leaned in and took the canine member in his mouth, earning a loud gasp of surprise and pleasure from Orion. The transforming male curled the digits of his paws as he put a hand on the back of Alex’s head, compelling the younger male to take more. <br />
<br />
The white fur quickly raced up Orion’s chest as Alex slowly ran his tongue up the canine shaft in his mouth, teasing the wolf a bit. Orion let out a whine as his mouth and nose began to push out into a canine muzzle. His ears grew pointed and moved to the top of his head as his eyes took on a golden yellow color. As the fur quickly overtook his face, a thick, furry tail sprouted from the male’s tailbone. <br />
<br />
“So…close…” the werewolf growled, pushing down harder on Alex’s head. “D-Don’t stop…”<br />
<br />
Alex obliged the werewolf’s wish, bobbing his head faster as he sucked Orion’s thick cock. Never in his life had he ever expected to be down on his knees sucking a werewolf’s cock, and yet here he was doing just that. He could feel the wolf’s cock throbbing in his mouth, ready to burst at any second. <br />
<br />
As the tip of the werewolf’s cock began to touch the back of his throat, Alex felt his lips meet the werewolf’s thick knot. The young man knew this next part would be a bit hard, but if he did it right, it would be a night that both he and Orion would remember for years. Clenching his eyes shut, Alex began to push forward. <br />
<br />
“K-K&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;?” Orion panted. “Wh-What are you-AH!” Orion threw his head back and cried out in pleasure as his knot slipped into Alex’s warm mouth, making the first few inches of his cock slide down into the human’s throat. Alex began to gulp out of reflex, his throat muscles squeezing and contracting around Orion’s member. Orion pushed his head down harder, burying Alex’s nose in his crotch fur. The young man inhaled deeply, savoring the powerful, masculine scent that the werewolf exuded. Then, Alex felt Orion’s balls contract right before the wolf threw his head back and let out a loud howl as he shot stream after stream of thick werewolf cum down the human’s throat. Alex kept swallowing and Orion kept cumming, eventually bringing the young man to his own orgasm, straining his boxers. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Orion’s orgasm finally died down. Panting, the wolf gave a slight tug and unknotted his cock from the human’s mouth. As the wolf cock left his mouth, Alex threw his arms around Orion’s chest and tackled the unexpecting werewolf to the ground, landing on top of him. <br />
<br />
“God damn…” Orion panted. “That was…that was <i>incredible</i>…” He ram his clawed fingers through Alex’s hair, tussling it slightly. “I’ve had a blowjob before, but I’ve never had one as good as the one you just gave me.”<br />
<br />
“Would you believe me if I said that was the first blowjob I’ve ever given?” Alex responded, a sly grin on his face. <br />
<br />
“There’s no way that was your first time!” Orion replied, rustling Alex’s hair with a chuckle. He then began to playfully lick the young man’s face, making Alex laugh and playfully try to stop him. After a minute, Orion stopped and wrapped his large, furry arms around Alex, holding him close. <br />
<br />
“I love you &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” Orion said softly. “Tonight has been wonderful. Maybe after a while, we can take things a bit further?”<br />
<br />
“You mean sex?” Alex asked. “Because if you’re talking about sex…” The young man leaned in and passionately kissed the werewolf, gently stroking behind his ears. <br />
<br />
“Why should we wait?”</p>
