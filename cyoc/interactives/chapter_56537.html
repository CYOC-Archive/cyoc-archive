<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four love dolls were named Lionel, Leona, Lionel, and Leona. For Leona had been only <br />
for Lionel, so interact between either would create a new counter part that was how the <br />
cascade nearly unleashed upon the world had worked. <br />
<br />
Now these four had souls had emerged from Eliza through Marie-Eliza as what Eliza <br />
described as 'what might have been.' And thus logically previous in the timeline had no <br />
souls. But Serenity had followed here by sense of the use of the game... a paradox. <br />
<br />
That these four now had souls given to them via Eliza's magical glass womb had the side <br />
effect of resulting in Marie having a collection of dolls and stuffed toys that possessed <br />
immortal spirits all their own, and thus were Marie's responsibility to look after and her <br />
burden to carry. It would be her duty to see they found loving owners after her, and that <br />
they were not neglected. Reality had been sure to extract it's price for cheating. It always <br />
did. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza had to create another Avatar just to return home on the other side of the <br />
planet just to tell them everything was alright and she hadn't abandoned them. <br />
<br />
In another timeline, the leoman love doll curse would go a long, LONG way into relieving <br />
fears about over population. After all, there weren't that many people life in the world after <br />
the love doll cascade had run it's course. And in yet another timeline, the end result was a <br />
silent, peaceful world filled with indestructible still and unmoving love dolls all named <br />
Lionel or Leona telepathically speaking sweet nothings of their love for each other well after <br />
the sun had burned out.  Maybe that was another incarnation of paradise for some, who <br />
was to judge? <br />
<br />
In this timeline meanwhile, the conditions of the old Transform to fate were in effect even <br />
if the game itself within them was now dead and obliterated. This meant that Leona was <br />
only for Lionel. And now that the reality cascade of making more love dolls was gone, this <br />
meant the threads of fate weren't likely to allow the dolls to be used, and would as per the <br />
transformation of fate never be separated, and would end up if not in storage then at least <br />
in some quirky modern art museum.  <br />
<br />
 Of course, Penny's wording of her command phrase made those changed into leoman from <br />
people changed into art had always been leoman, would this grant the four love dolls new <br />
existences as people? Or would reality tolerate that, or would reality encourage it as a <br />
solution as to why Serenity would have come to the four love dolls to begin with from her <br />
Game sense? <br />
<br />
Serenity took the four love dolls with her, not wanting to risk their 'owners' came back for <br />
them, as unlikely as that was. When she returned home with her odd prizes (along with a <br />
phone call to the brothers that she'd been sleeping at home tonight and they could <br />
continue to make the cure without her until she got back), she called out to Trevor only to <br />
remember he wasn't there anymore, the teenage boy turned into a cat never existed, there <br />
was only a young leoman cub who she had kept safe. Madam Serenity sighed, 'I didn't <br />
realize how much of a space he filled until it was gone...' <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Of course the lupmans had no clue about what Marie meant by 'true love powers' of the <br />
leoman, and only about half present knew who Madam Serenity was, but was so upset that <br />
no one thought to even question her about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn't be the last time Mal'akh would visit the hunters. More or less becoming <br />
their spy within Glendale no matter how much Marie kept telling her how foolish it was, <br />
Mal'akh was determined to prove she was a lioness.  Reality would extract it's price for the <br />
witch's obvious cheating. By the sneer natural laws of cause and effect it would.  The <br />
witches however, couldn't comprehend the idea that a child would work against them, they <br />
couldn't even understand the idea! After all, they were doing this for Joella, for all children <br />
of the world to be free from the world of adults.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Aimiliona was visited by her sister again, and again, and Joella greeted her each time eager <br />
to have another friend, the idealized human having more compassion than any other <br />
human had in a thousand years. And each time Aimiliona seemed to barely comprehend <br />
who this strange girl visiting her was, even as she began to easily recognize and <br />
communicate with Joella and the rest of the witch pride. Mal'akh was reduced to using <br />
Joella to speak to her own sister...  <br />
<br />
&quot;The next step in their scheme was logical as it could be from them. With the spell's power <br />
building up, they enacted another piece of their magically sustained utopia. If the witches <br />
had been still sane, they might have realized many people would have willingly and <br />
knowingly flocked to them if they hadn't been forcing this on others and using people as <br />
living shields and pawns. They began to rejuvenate Glendale.  At first it was simply a day <br />
for a day in reverse. Then it was a year for a month in reverse, then a week for a year, by <br />
the time the madness was finally put a rest and their concentration was shattered by a <br />
bone knife into their frontal lobes while they were on the knees and Joella not there to take <br />
the blow for them... it was nearing a year a day. The only exception of course being those <br />
already children, and adults already under their control, which accidently included Mal'akh <br />
due to them not being able to tell her apart from the Witch Pride's own cubs.  Other <br />
exceptions included the human and leoman they had given double sized life-spans to <br />
during their earlier experiments, who barely regressed at all during that time and due to <br />
their earlier experiments were pretty much immune to the haze the witches had over the <br />
town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And nobody questioned or noticed this?&quot; Lawernce had to ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone who came into the town was added to the witch's children, lions, or stewards <br />
remembers? And for the town folk themselves, at first it happened so slowly no one <br />
noticed, then by the time it became painfully obvious the fog they witches had placed over <br />
their minds left them unable to fully comprehend it. A fog that would shatter when their <br />
focus did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a thousand things could go wrong with doing that.&quot; Maddex's heads said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.&quot; Marie nodded, and snapped her fingers making Lilly and Casandra zone out for a <br />
few seconds, &quot;The side effect everyone in Glendale noticed... was that every pregnant <br />
woman in Glendale in a matter of weeks had suffered a miscarriage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lawrence looked sick. <br />
<br />
&quot;...monsters...&quot; Betty whispered.<br />
<br />
The cousins/half-sisters all paled. <br />
<br />
Eliza said nothing only looked down. She began to suspect where the souls of her womb <br />
had come from. <br />
<br />
&quot;The witches didn't know, and if they did they would have ignored it, and if they couldn't <br />
ignore it, they would have roared to themselves how it was all for the greater good of their <br />
magical utopia anarchy.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Present day. Present time. Thousands of miles away in the Caribbean there was a privately <br />
owned island on which sat an absurdly sized mansion. It was inhabited only by the elderly <br />
owner, countless maids and servants with bust lines that ran from impressive to comical, <br />
and one Genie. <br />
<br />
The old old man had helped into bed from his wheel chair he had been bound to for ten <br />
years by his smiling, blindly obedient all female servants. <br />
<br />
'Which one was the guy who always flushed my head? Which one was the girl who turned <br />
me down because my family wasn't rich enough? Which one was the guy who tripped me <br />
up at my shot at soccer try outs?'  The old man couldn't recall anymore, it had been so <br />
long. <br />
<br />
He had been granted a turn at the game, by a bully who after the bully's buddy used to the <br />
game to give the bully the muscles of He-Man decided to use the game to make it so the <br />
geek who kept getting better scores than him on every test they were in the same class of <br />
to empty himself whenever he heard a bell and to never explain why he did it. <br />
<br />
The geek had used his turn at the game to change a random girl into a blindly loyal genie, <br />
with the sub-clause her magic could never directly effect him just to be on the safe side. <br />
<br />
From that one Genie, countless bullies, thugs, and jokes had been made his bustly, blindly <br />
obedient loving servant girls.  Including of course the bully who had cursed him to begin <br />
with. Now with his memory going he couldn't even remember which one of his lovelies had <br />
BEEN that bully. <br />
<br />
Like all turn holders outside of Glendale with Kurse spread herself across the world, the <br />
Genie had finally lost her turn. <br />
<br />
'Too bad...' THe old man thought, 'I figured I'd ask Genie to Transform or Dare me into just <br />
one more happy empty headed busty maid... fitting punishment I think for the crap I've <br />
pulled... oh well... guess I'll have to take my chances in Hell after all...' <br />
<br />
His devoted and willing slaves didn't know how to help their own reason for living, old age <br />
was finally catching up to him... and he welcomed it. An entire lifetime of being surrounded <br />
by slaves he created, everyone agreeing with whatever he said... the sweetness of revenge <br />
had turned flavorless in his mouth years ago.  All that was left now was to wait for the end. <br />
<br />
Genie insisted she could create any number of babbles for him to cheat death... he refused <br />
all of them, and she had no choice but to obey. <br />
<br />
The old old man looked out the window, the maids outside only wearing aprons as they <br />
manned the garden as he had ordered them to when he had been younger, petty, small <br />
minded, and angry at the world he felt had cheated him. <br />
<br />
'Dammit!... What the Hell are they all going to DO with themselves once I kick the bucket?!' <br />
But he was sick of life. He was sick of this tiny little kingdom he had made that his Genie <br />
could provide ANYTHING for him, from treasures to the latest movies before they were <br />
even released in the theaters to exotic pets of extinct species. <br />
<br />
'They'll likely carry on as always, caring happily for a house for a dead owner until some <br />
drug smugger thugs happen on the island, try to cause trouble, and Genie just adds them <br />
to the staff or gallery or zoo... Dammit, what an idiot I've been! What a waste of a person! <br />
You happy with yourself now loser? You got what you wanted. And you're going to be able <br />
to take on iota of it with you!'<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.&quot; Genie brought him out of his thoughts, her and one of the maids, their names all <br />
ran together now along with their origins, &quot;Is there, is there, ANYTHING I can possible get <br />
for you? At all?&quot; Genie asked, scared, worried etched in her every feature.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I'm dead, bury my corpse under an unmark tomb stone in the rose garden.&quot; 'I don't <br />
deserve to be remembered.' <br />
<br />
&quot;M-m-master!&quot; Gasped the maid next to Genie. Had she been his mother or father? After <br />
the small minded git he was had Genie change her too after his parents had begun to give <br />
him a stern talking to over his selfish behavior? Did it matter anymore?<br />
<br />
&quot;I order you all to be happy. Tear down this stupid mansion after I'm gone and try to help <br />
for those whose only crime was being born in countries lead by  dictators who became <br />
dictator by gunning down the previous dictator! Become doctors and teachers as need be. <br />
But I don't you all to just continue like I'm still around! That is an order!&quot; <br />
<br />
After all, what were a few hundred or so immortal Barbie doll figured women on some no <br />
face island in the middle of nowhere doing missionary work?<br />
<br />
'Y-yes, master.&quot; The maid who might have once been his mother nodded between sobs at <br />
the thought of her master dying.<br />
<br />
The old man gave one final set of orders for Genie to play his favorite Beetles record and to <br />
hold him until his heart stopped beating.  The old man died. <br />
<br />
The Genie and Maids, loyal even past the end as they had been made to be, did their <br />
master instructed remaking the island that been devoted to the pleasure seeking of one <br />
man for over seventy years into a sanctuary for the forsaken of third world counties and <br />
military dictatorships.  And it was STILL only ONE tale of the many, MANY lives ruined or <br />
lost or stolen by the selfish desire inspired and encouraged by the Game of Transform or <br />
Dare. <br />
<br />

<br />
1689 Last Day of Spring <br />
<br />
Kathrine was hoping her hair would be back soon, she had shaven it and kept it extremely <br />
short as part of her vows as a nun. But she didn't like being mistaken for a leoman, nothing <br />
wrong with them in the least, she just liked being seen for what she was. <br />
<br />
Marie had noted how Mal'akh hadn't reacted greatly to see Draco, then again, with all the <br />
bandages he covered himself with, she perhaps wasn't able to tell his species of man. Not <br />
that Mal'akh would have recognized a dragon as anything more than that the feral four <br />
legged horrors like St. George had to put out of it's misery. <br />
<br />
The letters Linus got back were discouraging for Vatican.  Marie's sixth sense told her that <br />
first gargoyles in mass to be 'shipped' to the new world wouldn't be over a hundred and <br />
ten years. This made things increasingly bleak and discouraging for the male gargoyle. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to torture the information out of him are you?&quot; Draco asked Marie Cruz <br />
as if she was going outside in a pair of socks that did not match. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Marie Cruz asked in a similar off handed tone. After all, she had tortured people <br />
before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Linus.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;An Inquisitor can't go doing that without the presence of a priest.&quot; Marie said as if paper <br />
work prevented her from getting a day off, &quot;And I'll remind you the Inquisition has an <br />
'innocent until proven guilty' policy. Those who had said different are bigots who hate <br />
Spaniards.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz started, in spite of having been born in Spain, she had never really considered <br />
herself Spanish.  &quot;I guess.  ... And no I'm not. Him keeping secrets from us after you strong <br />
armed secrets out of him does feel rather aggravating, and I question WHY he needs to <br />
keep it a secret from us. But we are very short on allies and very large on enemies and even <br />
larger on potential enemies. I won't throw away a teammate whose prove himself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Draco thought for a moment, &quot;There is another option. What about that tricky of yours? <br />
With that eye of yours that's no longer there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz admitted, she hadn't considered that, then again, she had been using her sixth <br />
sense to mostly detect what the witches' sphere of influence currently was and how to <br />
avoid it. But it's power had been increasing as the mana drained from the rest of the world <br />
flowed into Glendale. &quot;Maybe I shall... &quot;</p>
