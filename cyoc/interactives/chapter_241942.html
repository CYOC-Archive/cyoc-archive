<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How’d you find the place, Jess?” River asked, stuffing their face with their lack of manors (Nisha cringing, obviously),<br />
“Me and Andre have been here before, we came here for our anniversary last year…” she looked at her watch,<br />
“A colleague recommended it to me.” Andre said, appearing suddenly. Jess rolled her eyes, “sorry, babe.”<br />
“I’ve been hearing a lot of that tonight.” He commented. Andre’s expression dropped,<br />
“I-I… it won’t be happening anymore. No more fuck-ups.”<br />
“You should really buy him a watch, Jess.” Nisha said, Jess smirked. Andre couldn’t help but feel bad… this app has screwed him over twice today.<br />
Doesn’t matter. He’s done with it… until they got home.<br />
<br />
The group continued eating and chatting. The vibes were pleasant, and all of them were having a good time. Although, Andre was feeling Jess’ stare once in a while.<br />
They were all done with their starters, and they continued their conversations, River talking about their newest project, Nisha about the job she was looking at as a teaching assistant, hoping to be a teacher soon. Jess was talking about her boss and how much she hated her, and Andre was trying his best to stay engaged… but his mind was still elsewhere. It was taking all his willpower now to open his phone and look at the app again.<br />
<br />
“Andre?” Jess tapped his foot,<br />
“Hm?” He replied, then looked at Nisha, who asked him where he was working now, “oh, uhm… still between jobs at the moment. But got an interview the other day, another Financial Analyst job, y’know. Pretty boring.” He chuckled to himself,<br />
“That’s sweet, how did it go?” She asked,<br />
“Good, honestly. Pretty good.” He smiled, he caught Jess’ eye, she wasn’t giving him death-stares anymore, which was an always good.<br />
<br />
Within a few more minutes, Jess excused herself to head to the bathroom. She looked at Andre, “will be about five minutes.” She teased, Andre cringed a little. It was a really bad mistake to piss off Jess, knowing how brutal she could be. He was lucky she was being so soft.<br />
As she walked off, he looked at River and Nisha, and they were talking to one-another about something.<br />
Andre couldn’t help himself. He opened the app again.<br />
<br />
He was still selected on himself, but decided to see if he could find Jess. Maybe the app could tell him something he could do to make it up to her. He found the women’s bathroom, and selected one of the dots:<br />
<br />
‘Megan Davis is worried about her husband’s eating habits’<br />
<br />
Wrong person… he clicked the next one.<br />
<br />
‘Jessica Bennet is talking with a lady in the bathroom about her boyfriend being late’<br />
<br />
“Shit…” Andre whispered to himself. But maybe… he could fix this. He tapped on ‘Late’ and replaced it with ‘Early’. Then he just sat there, not sure if it had worked or not… but maybe, if he asked River or Nisha.<br />
“Hey, guys?” He started, “can I just ask… what time did I get here?”<br />
River looked a little puzzled, “you okay, bud?” They asked,<br />
“N-no— yes! Just humor me for a minute,”<br />
“We came together, but you were already here when we got here.” Nisha said,<br />
Andre had to hold himself back from looking shocked. But he was astounded by what he just did. He just changed time itself.<br />
“Thanks, sorry for asking. Just… it’s…” he shrugged, “don’t worry about it.”<br />
“You look a bit distant, everything okay?” River asked,<br />
“Oh it’s nothing. Seriously.”<br />
“Dude.” River said, they looked at Nisha and then back at Andre, “we’ve got a minute to talk, you wanna take a minute?”<br />
“You’re too kind for your own good, River. I’m fine— I’m good actually, really good!” Andre smiled,<br />
“Okaaaaaay, whatever you say.” River winked at Andre.<br />
Andre looked towards the bathroom… still no Jess. He opened his phone, and decided to refresh the prompt again.<br />
<br />
‘Jessica Bennet is talking with a woman in the bathroom’<br />
<br />
He chuckled. Of course she’d make friends in a random restaurant. But why not… change something. Something a little more selfish… he bit his lip before changing the word ‘Woman’ with ‘Bimbo’.<br />
He pressed enter, then refreshed again.<br />
<br />
‘Jessica Bennet is trying to keep eye-contact with a Bimbo’<br />
<br />
Andre is amazed. He changed ‘Trying’ to ‘Failing’.<br />
Within a few moments, he saw the women’s bathroom door swing open, and out walked what could only be described as a true Bimbo. Jess followed behind her, and the two waved to each other as they parted ways.<br />
He quickly walked back to the table, a big grin on her face.<br />
“Babe, did you see that?” She asked, smiling wide,<br />
“See what?” Andre asked,<br />
“That woman! With fucking HUGE tits.” She turned to the rest of the table, “did you guys see her?”<br />
“What, her?” River said, pointing across the room, perfectly in view.<br />
“Yeah!” She giggled, “oh my god, she’s like… a perfect bimbo. With the talk and everything.” She giggled again.<br />
Andre noticed how much of a better mood Jess was in now. Being late must’ve really pissed her off.<br />
“Wow, she’s really got huge boobs.” Nisha said, eyes widening, taking a sip from her drink.<br />
“Her names Naomi, I think. I was just talking to her in the bathroom of ages. She’s a doctor… which is a little crazy.” She said.<br />
The group joked and chatted, Andre feeling a lot more wanted and seen now. Him and Jess were sharing several moments, relaxing. And for the most of it, they were holding hands over the table. Andre was smiling.<br />
<br />
While Jess was talking to River and Nisha, Andre couldn’t help but pull out his phone again. He wanted to play with this app so badly. It was addictive.<br />
He decided he wanted to change something about the table. He looked at the map, and clicked on one of the dots.<br />
<br />
‘Nisha Rao can’t stop thinking about Naomi’s huge fake breasts’</p>
