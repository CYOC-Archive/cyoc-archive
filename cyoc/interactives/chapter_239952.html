<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How long have I been using the Chronivac?&quot; Damon wondered as he sat before the laptop which had at one time belonged to Jack.<br />
<br />
There was so much, he was coming to realise, he didn&#39;t know about the programme, such as why the timer option did what it did. Thinking about it, he mulled over how every time he made the switch to become a pure-breed Siamese with a lion&#39;s dick, he&#39;d always set the timer for anywhere from seventy-two hours to, lately, as much as four months. And every time, when he&#39;d reverted back, it was always on the exact time and date he&#39;d originally set the timer. Wanting to know why this was, thinking there had to be some auto internal feature, or he had something turned on he didn&#39;t know how to disengage, he scrolled through his profile and the options available.<br />
<br />
Not finding what he was searching for, he toyed with the idea of making himself a cat once amore. Mind drifting to Jack, now Lily, he wondered where she was. Each time he&#39;d reverted back to his human form, and learned it was best to be back at Jack&#39;s place when he did, unless he wished to find himself naked in a strange place, as had happened the first handful of times, Lily had been there. Sometimes she was dressed, always in the garments he&#39;d programmed her to prefer, sometimes she was as naked as the day she&#39;d been born. Always unreceptive to his advances when he was human, Damon wished she was and he didn&#39;t have to make himself become a cat for him to live out his fantasies of making it with a female cat. Unwilling to make himself like her, a humanoid-cat, he often considered if maybe he ought to rescan her and force her to be more accepting of his advances.<br />
<br />
Curious to know where she was, as he seriously thought he might do this, Damon recalled how, lately, she hadn&#39;t been around when he turned back. Wanting to know why this was, itching to have another go with her, &quot;Even if I have to turn myself into a feline,&quot; he muttered to himself, he absently tapped a key and watched as his human profile shifted to his saved cat profile.<br />
<br />
He knew, if he changed himself, his beast form could find easily Lily. Something about being a cat drew him to her, as well as other felines, especially females. Thinking of all the times he&#39;d done it with a cat of the opposite sex, the way he&#39;d forced himself atop them, bit their neck, positioned himself so he could better plunge his lion cock into them, the way they yowled when he withdrew, their vulva slick whilst his own dick dribbled a smidge, he felt himself start to grow hard. Tapping out commands, he set the timer for a month, but didn&#39;t send the information to the emitter.<br />
<br />
Instead, he went back to re-search his profile, looking for anything which might explain why it was he always changed and reverted back on the same day at the same time, no matter how much time had passed. Seeing nothing which may prove an answer, Damon huffed in frustration. Deciding it wasn&#39;t something he&#39;d likely ever understand, he sent the information to the emitter. Standing, he shucked off the shirt he had on and activated the remote.<br />
<br />
The transformation happened just like it had every other time, it wasn&#39;t long before Damon was back down on all fours. Sitting down, he took a moment to check out his feline body, make sure everything was still the way he&#39;d programmed the Chronivac to make it, with his attention drawn mostly to his prepuce and the lion cock he now had. Seeing everything was in order, he proceeded to bath himself. Finishing this task, he wandered about, sniffing at things, searching for a clue as to where Lily might be. Discovering a faint scent after some time, Damon followed it through the open door and outside. Letting his instincts and tomcat knowledge guide him, he moved through the now larger world around him in an aimless manner as he followed Lily&#39;s trail, which sometimes was too faint to make out, or disappeared altogether, though he did manage to pick it up after some time and some trial and error.<br />
<br />
His ranging taking him further and further away from Jack&#39;s place, it was almost six hours later before he located her. Crouching low beneath a large, square trash bin on wheels, Damon blinked as he stared out at the female humanoid-cat. Wearing a tattered dress which was a size or two too big, there was something different about her. Watching as her tail switched back and forth as she worked to tip over a round trach can which was larger than she was, he observed the way she dropped to all fours when she&#39;d succeeded and began to nose through the trash, looking for something to eat. Her sex on full display, Damon was tempted to go to her, but he held himself in place as he struggled to work out what had changed about Lily.<br />
<br />
After some time, when she&#39;d had her fill of the choice morsels of food available, Lily stood back up on two legs. Wandering some ways away, she squatted down. Legs spread, tail up, she voided first her bladder, then her bowels. From where he was, Damon watched all of this, and as she finished, stepped away, he noticed the way her dress shifted to reveal something about her body. Seeing the way her abdomen pushed outward, it came as a start to Damon what was different was she was pregnant. Losing immediate interest in her, as he told himself she couldn&#39;t have become so from him and she must have been cavorting about with another cat, Damon slunk away. Prowling back alleyways, his roaming him taking him sometimes almost back to where he started, it wasn&#39;t long before he discovered a female cat. Listening to her plaintive calls, he soon answered as he crept nearer. Looking at the white-furred, short-haired, blue-eyed creature, he sniffed the air. Smelling her, and her need, he thought, &quot;This&#39;ll teach Lily for not being faithful to me,&quot; as nuzzled the female cat, meowed, and began a courtship ritual.<br />
<br />
The other feline not receptive to him at first, it was sometime before biological needs won her over and she raised her hind quarters, bent her forelegs as she brought her chest down and held her tail to the side, exposing her sex. Going to her, he mounted and nipped at her as his cock slid from his prepuce, and working himself into a better position, he nipped at her a bit more until he was able to thrust his erect lion shaft inside. Pumping, thrusting, feeling her beneath him, living out once again his fantasy to do it with a female cat, it wasn&#39;t long before he felt himself release his load into her. Finishing, he withdrew himself, and as the spines of his cock rubbed against her, and she yowled, Damon stepped back to first sniff at her privates, then sit down to wash and preen himself.<br />
<br />
Interest in the female waning, he soon moved on to find another female, where upon he repeated his actions all over again. Moving about, always returning to Jack&#39;s place when he needed to sleep, he never saw Lily again, and after some time, discovered he didn&#39;t care if she ever turned up. Month slipping by, it was with some difficulty he managed to recall this was the amount of time he&#39;d granted himself, and making his way back to Jack&#39;s, making it just before his transformation back to a human occurred, he was again wondering how many times he&#39;d done what he&#39;d done. Pulling on his clothes, he sat back down at the laptop and pulled up his profile. Looking at it, thinking he&#39;d had to have transformed somewhere over a hundred times, he wondered if maybe ought to take a break, see what else he could do with the Chronivac. Leaning back in the chair, Damon mulled over his options.</p>
