<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as the sun was setting Barbara, Elizabeth and Stacy where walking across the college green heading toward one of their favorite bars/restaurants. They had planned to eat and then go see a movie around 11. The green had multiple large trees with multiple private areas with benches surrounded by medium/high shrubs. The green was full with people but most where heading the other direction from the two of them, heading toward the home football game which would be kicking off in a few minutes. The two of them could hear the band playing even more then a mile away from the stadium. <br />
<br />
“I am just glad we reserved our table.” Stated Elizabeth as they reached their location. It was a small little garden area with a bench and a couple of flower beds and a small pound/water feature with some large koi fish. A hedge surrounded the area providing some privatize even though it was near the middle of the green. It was a favorite place for couples to meet up and more then a few people had proposed in that spot.<br />
<br />
Sitting on a bench waiting for them was James and amazing the rest of the area was actually abounded which was rare but considering the football game about to start wasn’t too surprising.<br />
<br />
“Evening I was hoping you weren’t running late.” Said James as he stood up and gave his girlfriend a kiss.<br />
<br />
“Not at all, parking was a little bit of an issue with the game on but…” started Barbara as she felt a tingle on the back of her neck. It felt so weird and was it suddenly hotter. <br />
<br />
She looked around, was it brighter then before? Everything looked clearer and she could smell things she did not a few second before. For a brief second, she thought she saw a glow on the back of James’s neck and from under the ponytail that Elizabeth had, then just as it appeared the glow was gone. <br />
<br />
“Do you guys feel strange?” inquired Stacy <br />
<br />
“Yah…” confirmed James as he grabbed his stomach, when he stood back up he was noticeably taller. He wasn’t short by any means, but he was shorter than Barbara who was extremely tall for a women and now he was almost her equal in height. That was their clue that something was wrong, and it was not just in their heads.<br />
<br />
They began to take a step out of the little hidden area only to stop, something deep within them was commanding them to stay hidden to stay out of view to protect themselves. Their new bodies and instincts told them that while transforming they where vulnerable and therefor they must protect themselves by remaining hidden. <br />
<br />
Barbara stumbled a bit as she fell onto a flowerbed, her breathing was rapid as she began to pull off her leather jacket as she did claws began to form from her nails. She did not mess with her top or her pants as she used her claws to rip them off. She was breathing heavily as she got back to her feet, she was now only wearing her orange sports bra which was straining against her already large and now growing bust and her bikini style bottoms. She focused on what was going on around her.<br />
<br />
James was across from her; his blonde hair was growing rapidly and his shirt had busted open as his body grew not only in size but in muscle. He was never built but he was now, Barbara was a lesbian, but she was impressed and attracted to his now six pack body and his tone arms. <br />
<br />
One the side of the pound closer to James, Elizabeth was on her hands and knees pulling off her clothes as dark blonde fur began to spread across her body. She seamed to have grown as well but had a much leaner look.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the pound closer to her was her girlfriend Stacy, she moved toward her and got on top of her. Stacy was in the process of taking off her cloths as well, but she was feeling herself up as she did. The sight of her girlfriend pleasuring herself was a bigger turn on then the muscles on James, she didn’t even care that Stacy’s face had pushed out into a short muzzle and two large black cat ears where now poking out of her jet-black hair. She straddled her girlfriend before leaning forward, lost in her pleasure Stacy didn’t notice at first but when she opened her eyes she pulled her down into a deep kiss as her hand which had been stroking herself went for her girlfriends pussy. Barbara was lost as well as so much in fact she failed to notice that she was bigger then she had been earlier and a long tail which was orange blonde with black strips had grew out of her tail bone. <br />
<br />
James was starting to get a hold of himself, he had grown in every way possible. He could feel his manhood harden to a level it never had before, to the point that he had to use his new claws to rip off his jeans and boxers. His eyes turned toward the larger source of movement, what he saw was a large muscular woman who looked like a professional boxer or the like with breasts that would have been too large on anyone else but worked great for her going to town with another women. What took him a moment to realize was that the women had a long tail, powerful claws, a short muzzle which was kissing other women with a muzzle and cat ears poking out of long blonde hair. Her body was rapidly being covered with orange blonde fur and she had multiple black strips across her body. Only her chest seamed to be clear of the strips with pure white fur. <br />
<br />
“Tiger…Barbara’s a tiger.” Said James his voice deeper, that meant the other women had to be Stacy and so it was. She had grown as well but her frame was thinner but still powerful and was jet black across almost her entire body. Dark tan fur covered her larger but still not nearly as large as her girlfriend’s breasts and she was purring so load that James could hear it. “Panther…Stacy is a black panther.”<br />
<br />
Movement heading toward him caused him to look closer to him and what he saw was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. A goddess on all fours was heading toward him, her back was covered with grayish fur with dark spots with lighter spots within those spots. An extra long tail which was puffy moved behind her perfect ass. Her head looked up at him and he saw the blue eyes of his girlfriend Elizabeth in a cat/human face with black ears poking out of her long blonde hair which was still in a ponytail. Her breasts hadn’t grown in size either, but she was strong looking and flexible. She never said a word but instead took his member in her mouth and began to give him a blow job, the addition of her new cat like tongue making it all the better as she went to town on him.<br />
<br />
“My…snow leopard.” He moaned as he himself was transformed, short blonde/tan fur began to cover his new much more muscular body as his blonde hair grew rapidly both on top of his head and around his neck. If he had seen that he would have known instantly what he was becoming, a lion man. He reached his climatic and let out a roar. <br />
<br />
That seamed to be the sign to everyone as all four of them began to regain control of themselves as they got to their feet and looked at each other. Barbara a large and powerful tigress, Stacy a quiet and deadly panther, Elizabeth an elegant and silent Snow Leopard and James a large and strong lion man.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” inquired Barbara</p>
