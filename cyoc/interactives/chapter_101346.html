+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Martha, Nate, and Alex left shortly after Eric returned home from walking Julie back to her own home. That left Eric home alone with his father, who he heard rummaging through something in the kitchen. It wasn&#39;t super loud, and with a were&#39;s sensitive ears, Eric could only just barely hear it, but it was enough to make him head into the kitchen. As he came in from the living room, he could see his father checking a few things in the fridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want dinner, Eric?&quot; William asked, &quot;we have some left overs that should be fine and I can warm them up easily. If you want something fresh... we have a little frozen meat that I could barbecue... though you&#39;d need to wait awhile for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, left overs will be fine,&quot; Eric answered, at first puzzled as to how his father knew it was him without looked. Though after a moment he realized that his father probably caught his scent and knew it. That made him wonder what would happen with his own senses when he became a weremer. He was certain they&#39;d work better under water than the rest of his family&#39;s senses would be under water, but out of the water, he wondered on how his senses would work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to eat now?&quot; William asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind,&quot; Eric spoke, &quot;but I have some questions... and it might be best to talk a bit before eating.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a moment, as his father stopped rummaging through the fridge for a moment, though Eric could see that he was still leaning into the fridge. After a few moments, William backed away from the fridge and let the door slide shut. He then looked down to his son for a few moments. William nodded a moment later and waved a hand out toward the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, lead the way,&quot; William said softly and let his son lead him back into the living room, and privately wondering what his son wished to talk about. He wondered if Eric was aware of what was happening to him and that he sensed that his own first transformation with Julie was coming. The two of them sat down together on the couch and William looked calmly to his son, &quot;So... Eric... what did you wish to talk about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;ve had a lot on my mind lately...&quot; Eric began, &quot;... about me and Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The two of you have a very &quot;story-book&quot; style romance going, so I&#39;m not surprised there,&quot; William commented with a smile and patting Eric on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of what&#39;s been on my mind hasn&#39;t been romance... it&#39;s...&quot; Eric began slowly, his voice growing weaker and softer as he went, though William heard him plain as day. &quot;It&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been thinking about sex and having sex with her,&quot; William finished for him.<br />
<br />
Eric blinked and blushed at the same time. He had been having some thoughts on that nature, especially as so many of his dreams of Julie had involved having sex with her and turning into her weremerman. However, what had really gotten him thinking about it was that Julie&#39;s plans for tomorrow seemed likely that she had had plans to have sex with him. Her commentary about him being &quot;good for her&quot; made him worried that he might not be good for her and she&#39;d dump him for it. As he walked back to the house, he&#39;d come to the idea to talk with his father privately, as based on the handbook that he&#39;d read in the library, werefoxes were known not only for their firm bonds to those they loved, very open about their sexual lives, but seemed to instinctively know every possible trick to please their partners. He figured that his father might be able to give him a few pointers for whenever the &quot;moment&quot; came for him and Julie, be it tomorrow or later on.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s blush only confirmed to William what the answer was. If he didn&#39;t know about what Melissa Stovall had told him about Julie&#39;s and Eric&#39;s loving bonds being strong enough that they were reaching a point where the specialized manner of mer-courtship put his son and the Stovall daughter in a place where neither of them would be able to fight, he might try to urge Eric to wait. As while he had enjoyed the sex that he&#39;d had been having with Martha since their respective transformations, both in human and in were form, and he privately loved the rise in his wife&#39;s libido since she became a werecat, he didn&#39;t want his sons to end up in a situation like the one he had put his family in with his affairs in the past. It was why he talked with Nate to make sure that Nate knew where his relationship with Alex was headed and looked to more than just the sex that came from having a were&#39;s libido. And if the situation with Julie was different, he&#39;d want to urge Eric to wait until he was sure that Julie was the one, as if they had sex and then things didn&#39;t work out... it&#39;d be tougher for them to go back to being friends afterward.<br />
<br />
However, from what Melissa Stovall had told him, their relationship had progressed to a point where Julie, at least, was sure that Eric was the only one for her. With that, things were progressing so fast and so strong that even if they resisted, eventually the need to show the other how much they loved one another would grow to the point that neither of them would be able to fight it for long. There, the only thing William could really hope for was that WHEN the moment came, it came in a private and romantic moment that didn&#39;t alarm anyone, not like how his transformation began with a burning need for Yvette and wandering into the woods after her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, son,&quot; William said softly, putting aside his entrance into were society for the moment, &quot;From everything I&#39;ve heard... from you, your mother, from the Stovalls, and from Julie... it would seem that the two of you are very much in love... and I suppose that isn&#39;t a bad thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be bad for her...&quot; Eric said nervously, &quot;when the time comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s rather normal,&quot; William commented, &quot;most couples generally aren&#39;t great lovers the first time they have sex... in fact much of the myth of sex being painful for women the first time probably comes from the fact that both are inexperienced at sex. It leads to them into making certain... mistakes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would I avoid that?&quot; Eric asked, unable to hid the blush in his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the big thing is to always be gentle,&quot; William advised, &quot;you can always get rougher if it turns out that Julie likes that... but to start with, at least... be gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next is a bit of an anatomy lesson,&quot; William said calmly, &quot;first of all... there are some three points to remember between a woman&#39;s legs. First is the clitoris, a small and sensitive nub that&#39;s at the front of the outer sexual folds. Moving toward her back... next is a woman&#39;s urethra, which is what a woman will pee out of when she has to go. You don&#39;t put fingers or anything else there as it serves no sexual purpose. After the urethra comes the vagina, which is the main sexual organ for a woman. This is where your... you... you-know-what goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The vagina is rather elastic and can stretch around a man&#39;s penis, but when beginning any sexual encounter, it is best to make sure that a woman is sufficiently aroused... or wet,&quot; William continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wet?&quot; Eric asked, &quot;I dump a bucket of water on her?&quot;<br />
<br />
William gave a nervous chuckle at that, &quot;No... it&#39;s a term that refers to a woman&#39;s arousal. A man gets a hard-on as his penis grows erect... a woman gets wet as her clitoris is aroused and stimulated and helps naturally lubricate her vagina and allowing it to more easily stretch around a man&#39;s erection. That&#39;s also a point where a woman may experience pain in her first time. Her partner hasn&#39;t adequately stimulated her enough and that while her vagina can stretch it isn&#39;t ready to do so, yet. The pain she feels is the man&#39;s penis forcibly stretching her vagina before it is ready... it may get better once they continue her arousal catches up... but the fact remains that if she isn&#39;t sufficiently wet beforehand... sex could be painful for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how do I do that?&quot; Eric asked nervously. His voice often started strong but grew weaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;The big thing there will be with good foreplay,&quot; William said slowly, &quot;there are places on a woman&#39;s body that will be sensitive and valuable to sexual intercourse... though some are more sensitive than others. Some may even be more sensitive for some women and less so for others. And in these cases, this is where you&#39;ll need to be gentle... because if they are sensitive, if you&#39;re gentle... you can give a woman tremendous pleasure. If you&#39;re rough... you could give a woman tremendous pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nervously blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... the places that will be the most sensitive on a woman will include her breasts and nipples, her clitoris, vagina, and her vulva, the outer folds that cover the vagina and clitoris, and her lips,&quot; William continued, &quot;the rest can be very sensitive but not as sensitive as the the first set... with a woman&#39;s ears, neck and shoulders, her upper chest, her sides, her back, lower abdomen, her buttocks, the perineum, which is a point between a woman&#39;s vagina and anus, her inner thighs, her feet and toes, and any place where a woman&#39;s skin folds... behind the knees, the outside of the elbows, her eyes, or under her breasts... and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that&#39;s a... that&#39;s a lot of places,&quot; Eric said slowly and nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes... but again, how sensitive some of these areas are will probably vary with the woman,&quot; William spoke, &quot;some may be VERY sensitive there... others not so much... for some the area of sensitivity could be large while being small with others. You&#39;ll only find out where those areas are with Julie when your time comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric only gave a nervous gulp.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last points will be at a woman&#39;s scalp, her arms, and her hands,&quot; William finished, &quot;though these areas will be the least sensitive sexually and it might be easier for you to focus on the other areas that are more sensitive. If you can rub those points gently enough... you will be able to fully arouse your partner to the point where she will be wet enough to take your... your penis without pain. From there... it can progress into thrusting your erection into your partner&#39;s vagina. You can rub some of the erogenous zones while you thrust into your partner... but as I&#39;ve stressed... be gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... how... how will I know I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve done it right?&quot; Eric asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally your partner will let you know,&quot; William gave a soft smirk, &quot;Just remember to be gentle and the areas where you can or might give Julie pleasure and do your best make sure she is ready...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... I want you try and wait as long as you can,&quot; William advised, &quot;I know you love Julie... but both of you are still very young. Don&#39;t just rush to it. If the right moment comes... that&#39;s one thing... but don&#39;t let yourself be lead by your penis as I had back in Minnesota.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Eric spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; William commented, &quot;now, why don&#39;t we warm up some dinner, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Eric answered quietly and walked toward the kitchen.<br />
<br />
William watched him as he walked. At part of him was nervous over sharing so much sexual information with his son, but he knew Eric loved Julie and he knew that their courtship had grown so serious so fast that they might not be able to stop themselves when it happened. He figured it best to make sure that at least Eric and Julie wouldn&#39;t have an awkward first time together. Urging Eric to wait before becoming truly sexually active could wait until after his transformation was completed and his hormones were back under his control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be happy with her, son,&quot; William gave a sigh as he then got up and began to follow Eric into the kitchen.</p>
