<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next couple days Bradley slowly learned to deal with his new problem, mostly because when the farmhands did see that he didn't have feet they said nothing about his hooves, treating them as something normal. And if that wasn't enough, one of the help discovered him eating grass and grains. But instead of saying anything about, the man just sat down next to Bradley and began to eat his own lunch, making idle conversation as the two ate.<br />
<br />
Unsure how to take this, sure that the farmhands were having him on and did notice something wrong Bradley listened and kept and eye out. But to his surprise, none of the help acted as if anything was out of the ordinary and Bradley did in fact have hooves and did eat like a horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening?&quot; Bradley asked himself one day as he sat under a tree out in one pastures, absently plucking grass and eating it as he attempted to sort out his problems.<br />
<br />
Somewhere nearby he heard a horse calling out and gazing down at his hooves, he thought, &quot;The problem, it seems, is that I am turning into a horse,&quot; but immediately thought this was the most ridiculous thing he'd ever thought and that it wasn't possible.<br />
<br />
But something in his mind refused to accept this as clearly his strange appetite, the fine white hair covering his ankles and the fact that he had horse hooves instead of feet clearly dissuaded such a notion. Somewhere he could hear a couple horses neighing and suddenly wanting to forget his problems, failing to remember that a lot of his problems came from what he was about to do, Bradley decided that what he needed was a way to relax. &quot;And the best way to relax,&quot; he thought as he leaned down and tore a tuft of grass from the ground with his teeth. &quot;Is to do what makes you happy and relaxes you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing, he gazed around the pasture and seeing nobody present, sure that the farmhands were off working on something or another up in the stables, Bradley took a deep breath and slowly began to strip. Leaving his clothes under the tree, he stretched and after a moment, took off running.<br />
<br />
He'd never felt so free before as he ran naked across the pasture, his feet carrying him easily and when he came to a Mare he knew to be named Gala, Bradley lay down next to her. As he did this, he glanced about and made sure there were no other horses nearby and none of the farmhands were present. Positive that he was alone, Bradley shifted about until he was lying on top of the Mare.<br />
<br />
Beneath him Gala nickered and gazed up from where she was lying and swished her tail. Making noises to keep her calm, Bradley shifted his position and attempted to lift her tail. With a grunt, Gala stood with Bradley still atop her. Struggling to stay atop the Mare and still be able to get at the area beneath her tail, Bradley grunted and shifted himself. Suddenly, he heard something behind him and worried, he attempted to slide off of Gala.<br />
<br />
As he slowly slide off the horse, Bradley heard a snort and felt something wet press into butt. Alarmed, knowing it was a horse muzzle, Bradley tried to pull away but found himself both unwilling and unable. And than, with a grunt, the horse pinned him to the ground and began to have his way with Bradley.<br />
<br />
Wanting to scream out in panic as he felt the horse's penis thrusting into his body, almost as if he had a vagina, Bradley instead let out a squeal of pleasure. Next to the Bradley and his horse lover, Gala watched for a moment before letting out a nicker and trotting away. After what seemed like an eternity the horse atop Bradley let up just as Bradley felt something shooting into his body. With a snort, the horse that was atop him shifted and pulled away. As he did this, Bradley rolled over and blinked up, finding the sun was keeping him from seeing properly.<br />
<br />
As he lay there, blinking, he absently ran a hand down his body and touched his penis, testicles and the area between his legs. Finding no vagina entrance, he wondered how it was the horse had been able to blow his wand into Bradley and after a couple seconds he decided that what had happened was that the horse had somehow blown its spunk into his anus.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been anally raped by a horse,&quot; Bradley thought.<br />
<br />
Rolling over, he heaved himself up and began looking about for the horse. Not seeing it, only spying Gala, Bradley wondered where the horse that had had its way with him went. Taking a step, he paused as he realised that something was off and glancing down as he absently ran a hand over his body again he definitely decided something was wrong as he appeared way to large.<br />
<br />
Terrified, Bradley glanced about and after a moment, forgetting that he was naked he took across the pasture, heading for the stable. Inside, he headed toward the grimy mirror that somebody had mounted on the wall years before Bradley's parents had owned the ranch. Peering into the reflective surface, Bradley moaned as he took in his eleven-foot height and the fact that he now clearly looked like he weighed one thousand two hundred and forty three pounds. And than it came to him how easily he moved weighing so much. Glancing down, he let out neigh of terror, unaware that he'd done so, as he noticed that the white horse hair that had been covering his ankles now covered his shins.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is happening,&quot; Bradley thought as he looked about wildly.<br />
<br />
Scared, wondering if he was being punished, Bradley moved away from the mirror and after a moment, found a clean stall with fresh straw spread across the floor. Wandering in, he lay down on the straw and finding it comfortable, not caring if one of the farmhands saw him, he stared at the wall and let his mind drift.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not my fault,&quot; Bradley thought after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did nothing to deserve this,&quot; he reasoned as he lay on his side and stared at the wall. After a bit, he heard somebody coming in and not really caring, he just continued to lie there.<br />
<br />
A voice issued a command and realising that the farmhand were bringing in the horses for the evening, Bradley wondered if he should help. Instead, Bradley decided that he would rather just lie there. But than his thoughts were jarred as he heard a gate being closed and somebody called out, &quot;Bradley's in,&quot; which was followed by another noise of another stall being secured by another horse being announced as being secured.<br />
<br />
Struggling up, Bradley made his way over to the gate and rattling the door, he called out, &quot;Hey! What gives?&quot;<br />
<br />
To his surprise, one of the farmhands approached and running a hand over Bradley's nose, much in the same way he would run it over a horse's muzzle, the help said, &quot;What's up Bradley? Something got you spooked, girl? Don't worry and relax. You're fine.&quot; and turning away, the help walked away.<br />
<br />
Unsure what had just happened, Bradley stood there for a moment, staring out at the stable. Than the farmhand was back, holding a feedbag. Wanting to repeat himself, Bradley was cut off as the help fitted the nosebag on Bradley and commented, &quot;There's a good girl,&quot; and turning away, the help walked away, returned, fitted another feedbag on another horse and repeated this until all the horses were feed.<br />
<br />
Eating the contents of the nosebag, Bradley once again wondered if he was being punished, but found himself unsure as to what. After the feedbag had been removed he lay down on the straw and after a moment decided that it must be a gift of some weird kind. &quot;After all,&quot; he reasoned. &quot;I love everything about horses, so this must be a gift.&quot; But something in his mind refused to believe this and letting out a snort, Bradley continued to lay on the straw, staring at the wall, his mind drifting from one possible suggestion to the next.</p>
