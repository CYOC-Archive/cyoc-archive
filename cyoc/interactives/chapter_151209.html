<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Horrified at the aspect of further physical changes, a black furred satyr made his escape from the transitioning cell where Lusious ordered the man kept. He had lived for two months in a virtual hell, more often made sickly due to the injections given him. He had puked until he saw it come out as mixed with blood. He often urinated a deep orange colored stream, denoting blood in his urine. His poop-chute often had blood traces, suggesting how his guts were changing, becoming similar to being in part a goat and man, he becoming a satyr.<br />
<br />
A determined individualist when working, his sense of determination remained vigil. As his body showed the manner of his physical changes, it angered him, causing fit of rage directed toward the persons coming to give injections or serve him rations of food.<br />
<br />
When Lusious brought Lynn to see his handiwork, as the sight of the satyr seemed to arouse her, Lusious left Lynn to a possible raped fate. Lynn was scared, but the seemingly lusty satyr changed his demeanor when Lusious left them two alone. His manners returned and he asked Lynn to be calm, as he was not insane as he had Lusious thinking, that his created satyr was a sex fiend.<br />
<br />
Lynn and the satyr became as friends, and later, by her choice as lovers. Lynn took her chances and visited the satyr often, enjoying the length and girth of his cock. They would frolic for hours during a night time visiting. Lynn often wondered if the satyr was in some manner infectious. Her wonderment based on the serum injections given to make him transform, she thought might be merged, blended with his semen. As such not that she might become pregnant, he being by then more a goat than a human, they were of differing species.<br />
<br />
What worried Lynn some was if the serum in his bodily fluids would infect her, causing her body to begin showing signs of becoming a female goat. She was careful to wash thoroughly after a nightly satyr sex session.  As much she felt sad when she heard the news he had overpowered a newbie technician and made an escape from the security barn. Lusious was furious about the escape of his satyr, and in his fashion of ruling the business with an iron hand, he deemed the technician to become his first female satyr creation.<br />
<br />
Working there at the research department of Sunrise Research, animal husbandry division, came with a great deal of tension and general fears of some horrid reprisal by Lusious, Sarah, or most anybody in upper management. Lynn felt the wish to run, but not run away, just exercise by taking an evening time jogging or run out along the rural roads.<br />
<br />
As on one quiet evening as Lynn jogged the traffic along the main road caused her some concern. She turned to run along a side road, a gravel road not often traveled because of the dust. About three miles out on her run and from near her she heard, &quot;Baaloo, ahloo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynn stopped and stood listening, as looking around her, the sun setting made shadows longer, what was shadowed as darkened.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAALOO...!&quot; Again she heard the odd sounding cry, as almost if someone where slurring a hello for to meet her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baaloo..., Me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Lynn then saw what she did not believe could be real, as standing along a pasture fence, stood a large, almost a big as a pony, a male goat with his herd of fifty plus doe goats.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAAloo,&quot; the big goat bleated, his manner of bleating seemed to include a phrase what sounded as a hello.<br />
<br />
Sweaty, tired, so Lynn thought to stop and go pet the big goat. She walked off the road and through the chest high weeds to the pasture fence. Her coming closer seemed to delight  the big buck, as he turned his rump for her to get the view of his cock as aroused, stiff, but with something she recognized. The big black furry buck was as she recalled from her satiric lover, as still circumcised. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you became as almost all a goat, and kept somehow your intelligence. Lusious said you would continue to change, but after a while lose your knowledge, becoming an ignorant animal. How long now since you escaped, two, three months? Yet here you are, being a very large buck goat, and able to form words when you bleat.<br />
<br />
Wow, I see you recall well how we frolicked, you are very aroused. Indeed, your cock is like a goat with the interesting exception of it retaining your circumcision. As the circumcision on a male goat cock suggests of a heighten sensual experience; I bet your goat harem loves you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynn then leaped the pasture fence and knelt beside her male friend turned goat, as she fondled his cock and felt the increased weight of his furry big balls.<br />
<br />
Neither she or him was capable of doing vaginal sex pleasuring there in the pasture, so Lynn pleasured her friend by suckling him to an orgasmic ejaculating the like he never did with her before. His bigger, mature sized balls spent an increased volume of semen when he got really aroused, and after seeing, meeting again Lynn, this buck goat became highly aroused.<br />
<br />
The two friends frolicked for a couple of wondrous hours, or until a few of the doe goats became highly jealous of Lynn, and took to pissing at as on, dousing her to being soaked in goat piss.<br />
<br />
Oddly Lynn did not mind the aggressive attentions from the doe goats, even if her lover did, as he took to chasing his harem away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks my friend, as now I know where you call as home, I shall come to visit you often!&quot; Lynn said, and wet with doe goat piss, she returned to the rural road and ran back to the research compound and a needed shower.</p>
