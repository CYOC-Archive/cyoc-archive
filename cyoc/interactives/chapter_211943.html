<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana next decided to have a look at the Clown Club. She always found them so annoying, the way they capered about campus with their pranks and antics, peppering their speech with giggles, and honking their noses. When she&#39;d been Dylann Diana hadn&#39;t cared about clowns one way or the other but now, she positively hated clowns of any sort. Even the ones she&#39;d known before they joined the Clown Club. Haylee disliked them too, ever since the last homecoming game when several clowns had come up in a little clown car and pelted her with pies as she finished the halftime cheer. <br />
<br />
The building the Clown Club used looked like an ordinary faculty house on the outside. On the inside, Diana knew from the few times she&#39;d been inside it was painted in bright and vibrant colors like a circus tent. It still was, only now there was no lively circus calliope music playing, and the floor was now covered with spongy foam, rubber, or plastic clown noses. <br />
<br />
Not to mention standing or sitting on couches or chairs were nearly thirty of the most depressed-looking former clowns anyone had ever seen or imagined. Some even had their faces in their hands and were sobbing. <br />
<br />
They were still dressed in the colorful clothes they normally wore, and some were even still wearing oversized clown shoes. Judging by the ones who were barefoot, Diana could see their feet had shrunk back to their original size. <br />
<br />
The ex-clowns hadn’t completely changed back to their original appearance. Sure, their feet had shrunk, the clown noses had fallen off and their ‘make-up’ had reverted to their old skin tones. But they had kept whatever weight they’d gained, which made them look much older than the young adults they truly were. That, and while the former clowns’ hair reverted to their ‘pre-clown’ color, the style remained. Half the guys who joined the clown club had become at least partially bald when they changed.  <br />
<br />
And they were still bald now. <br />
<br />
Diana saw a rather depressed girl with a blond ‘afro’ wearing a flashy colored baby doll dress sitting on a chair nearby. She recognized Carol Feins, a girl that Dylann had frequently hit on before joining their respective clubs. In one hand she held a can of beer, another a red foam clown nose. Like the others she had gained some weight but only a little, and mostly in her bosom and hip, giving Carol a full lush figure. <br />
<br />
Diana walked over to where Carol was sitting; all the former clowns were so absorbed in their depression and misery they took no notice of the cheerleader. “Hello, Carol. <br />
<br />
Carol looked up and her eyes widened. “What are you doing here?” she asked, her voice dull and weary.  <br />
<br />
“Thought I would check up on you after seeing what’s happened to the mermaids and the furrys.” <br />
<br />
“What-whatever happened to us,” Carol stammered, “it’s happened to other clubs too?” <br />
<br />
Diana grinned as she nodded. “We think it’s happening to those with the most radical transformations. Smaller changes, like hair or weight gain, evidently, aren&#39;t affected as much. Neither is gender.” She looked around the room. “They weren&#39;t too happy about it, but none seemed as down as you buffoons.” <br />
<br />
Carol let out a long sigh. “When I became a clown-I felt this euphoria of joy unlike anything before.  <br />
We all felt it I was happy and carefree, food tasted better, booze was more intoxicating, weed got me higher than ever. And it never wore off. We all felt it. And now that feeling’s gone, like a the low after a really blissful high, or a hangover after a wild night of drinking.” She took a sip of her beer and made a face. “Ugh. This was my favorite beer, and now it tastes like vinegar.”  <br />
<br />
Carol set down her beer and reached for her nose before catching herself. “God, it’s really gotten to be a habit. I loved honking my nose; the euphoria only intensified whenever I did.” She looked at the foam ball she still held in her other hand. “This doesn’t even honk when I squeeze it; it’s just an ordinary clown nose.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I never got how that worked. Or how you bozos peppered your words with those weird chuckles and giggles.” <br />
<br />
“It was all impulse,” Carol replied. “I don’t know why I’m bothering trying to explain; it’s like trying to describe the Mona Lisa to someone who was born blind. Oh, and sex was amazing too. My clit would inflate into a red ball whenever I got horny; clownguys’ cum would squirt out like silly string-,” <br />
<br />
“Okay,” Diana replied, hoping to cut Carol off before getting a crash course in Clown Sex Ed. “I just wanna tell all of you that, since you all are no longer clowns, there are openings in the Cheer Squad Club.” Of course, most of the girls wouldn’t be built for it, ranging from chubby to plump; a couple were even outright obese. Carol had only gained a little weight from before and it was mostly in her breasts and hips. A little full-figured for a cheerleader, but not too much.  <br />
<br />
‘And what a figure,’ Diana thought. Carol’s colorful dress was low cut at the neck, revealing the top of her full, lush bosom; Diana felt her own nipples go hard at the sight. ‘Too bad she’s only into guys.’  <br />
<br />
The former clowngirl only gave out a wry chuckle. “Really?” She stood up from her chair, took a couple of steps-, <br />
<br />
-and then fell flat on her face. “Could you help me up?” <br />
<br />
“Sure,” the cheerleader said with a smirk. With Diana’s help, Carol got back on her feet, who the collapsed back in her chair. <br />
<br />
“It’s this.” Carol held up her left bare foot. “My feet only an hour ago were three times as long and the toes were a lot wider-and now it’s lot harder to walk in them.” <br />
<br />
‘No wonder all of them are sitting down,’ Diana thought gleefully. <br />
<br />
“Excuse me?” Diana turned and saw three girls, rather thin and petite especially for this group, wearing the colorful ‘clownesque’[ style of clothes standing behind her-and they had no trouble walking unlike the others. And unlike anyone else, they wore shoes that were normal sized albeit clownish looking. <br />
<br />
It was an Indian looking girl with two curly ponytails and dressed in orange coverall and a tie-died shirt who spoke. “I’m Lakshmi Urundabaelli, and this is Ruthie Emmett-,” a Caucasian girl wearing a pink tutu and leotard with puffy sleeves nodded, “and Khia Jones.” The last was a black girl in a puffy yellow blouse and a purple apron dress. “You said there were openings in the Cheer Squad club?” <br />
<br />
“Of course,” Diana said. “You not having any trouble walking?” <br />
<br />
Ruthie shrugged. “Unlike most, the three of us didn’t gain any weight and our feet remained normal when we got ‘clowned.’” She sighed. “I miss my nose, and the joyful feeling we got, but we can’t just sit around wallowing in self-pity.” <br />
<br />
“I guess.” Diana smirked. “Of course, the ‘half-fro’ style isn’t exactly the best look for a cheerleader.” <br />
<br />
Ruthie rubbed her scalp, like nearly half the guys but unusual even for a girl clown it was bald and smooth with a thick mass of auburn curls stretching from her ears to the back of her head. “I can get a wig or toupee,” she said. “I took gymnastics before joining the Clown Club, Lakshmi and Khia had both done ballet. Cheerleading shouldn’t be too hard for us.” <br />
<br />
“That’s it?” Carol looked at the three. “You are gonna give up on the Clown Club?” <br />
<br />
“Look around you.” Khia waved her hand. “There is no more Clown Club. Just a bunch of sad, mostly overweight teenagers, sitting around and acting gloomy. You want to mope, go right ahead. The three of us want to belong to a club that means something.” <br />
<br />
“I don’t want to mope,” Carol retorted. “I want to be a clown again. I want to act silly and be silly. I want to honk my nose and have big feet, to giggle, caper about and pull pranks on the other students and faculty with impunity because that’s what clowns do!” She glanced back at Diana. “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” <br />
<br />
“Every minute of it.” <br />
<br />
Carol’s face screwed up in anger. “When I heard you joined the Genderbender club and became a girl, I thought it might make you a better person. But you went from being a son of a bitch to a full blown bitch. <br />
<br />
Diana’s smirk grew wider. “I’m so flattered.</p>
