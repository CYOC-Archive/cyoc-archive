<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You’re sure it’s the same Keith? You looked into who he was on the other side?” Stripes asked curiously, wrinkling his brow with concern.<br />
<br />
“As much as I can. Obviously there aren’t any records leftover now that he’s come to stay on this side, but I asked a few people who knew him last year and they could still remember a tiny bit about what Keith had talked about during his freshman year,” Max sighed. “The high school he went to matched the one on the application Dare’s family submitted, so they went to school together.”<br />
<br />
“…But this still shouldn’t happen,” Stripes immediately pointed out. “Once Keith decided to stay, people who knew him on the human side shouldn’t really remember him that clearly…”<br />
<br />
“I mean, it’s Dare, so he didn’t exactly give me too many details about what happened between him and Keith. But it sounded like it was more than just a little bullying,” Max said. “And if it was something traumatic enough to turn Dare into… well, the kid’s a hot mess, right? I doubt that kind of stuff is so easily erased.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, fine. So, what am I supposed to do, then? Somehow keep those two from interacting or risk a fight?” Stripes groaned, falling backwards onto his bed and staring at the ceiling. “Ugh, why did they stick all the complete nutcases onto my floor… Last year wasn’t this bad, was it?”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, you’re such a mom,” Max giggled, jumping onto the bed and pinning his boyfriend down. “You just want all your little baby boys to get along, huh?” He let out one of his trademark hyena cackles before leaning down and locking lips with Stripes, trying to settle the zebra’s nerves a bit.<br />
<br />
“No, I just know that Dare’s already a goddamn wreck, and I <i>don’t</i> know what he’ll do when he finds out his high school bully is living on campus!” Stripes replied as soon as he was able to pull away from Max.<br />
<br />
“So what if he finds out? So Dare throws a punch or two, big deal. You said Dare trimmed his claws, and Keith’s built like a fucking wall, so nobody&#39;s getting hurt. Let ‘em let off a little steam, then they’ll be good ‘til graduation,” Max smirked, then he gently tugged at the waistband of Stripes’s jeans, undoing the fly and slowly pulling the zipper. “And speaking of letting of steam…”<br />
<br />
“Max, this is important, so could we-“ Stripes started to say, only to give up halfway through. When Max got like this, there was no stopping him, and Stripes was sort of in the mood for some fun as well. “Did you do your homework, at least?”<br />
<br />
“Sure did, <i>‘mom’</i>… Eww, that felt really gross to say,” Max frowned, then he shook his head to get the image of Stripes in a floral dress and high heels out of his head. Luckily, the image wasn’t enough to chase away Max’s arousal in the least, and he finally pulled his boyfriend’s pants all the way down and began to drool as Stripes thick, equine cock flopped right into his face. He wasted no time in running his long tongue up and down its warm length, soaking it in drool and getting it nice and wet before clumsily yanking off his own shorts.<br />
<br />
“T-there’s some lube… in the drawer…” Stripes grunted, holding back a moan as Max resumed his foreplay. Whenever Max really got going, it was enough to make Stripes nearly melt into the bed, especially since he knew exactly what the hyena had up his sleeve.<br />
<br />
“Stripes, darling, you know I don’t need any lube. You’ve already fucked this hole into the perfect shape for your biiiiig, <i>thiiiiick</i> horsecock~,” Max moaned, drawing out every word and feeling Stripes’ dick throb with every syllable. “Now, just sit back and let me handle things down here, huh?”<br />
<br />
“God, I fucking love you, man,” Stripes sighed, laying his head back on the pillow and feeling Max’s muscular ass grind against his cock before slowly lowering down to ride him. Max let out the quietest gasp as his well-stretched asshole engulfed the wide tip of Stripes’ cock, and Stripes relished ever second as his boyfriend carefully took every single inch of it into his body.<br />
<br />
At the moment, the last thing on Stripes’ mind were the problems of all the skunks, boars, dogs, and sheep on his floor. After all, he deserved to let off a little steam once in a while too, right?<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Dare looked up from his textbook as the door to the room opened and Milo trudged in. “Hey, Milo. I just got back and was wondering where you were…” he said, pulling off the new headphones he had bought once his ears started changing. “I finally found a streaming app for my phone since all the old ones didn’t work on this side. Found a nice playlist too, not that I know any of the bands, but-… Jesus. You look like shit.”<br />
<br />
Milo felt like shit. Immediately after the photo shoot earlier that morning, Ollie had pulled him off to a corner of the common room and told him his idea to leave the college and try to find a way back to the human side again. And although Milo couldn’t get Ollie to say it, he knew that the sheep was going to ask Curtis to come along. Milo had tried saying everything he could, pleading with Ollie to just give things until the end of the semester to make his decision, but Ollie just kept on smiling his usual big grin and reassuring Milo that he’d be just fine. His smile had only cracked when a tear came to Milo’s eye and the big boar nearly broke down completely. <i>Please. You’re one of the only friends I’ve got. Not just here, but anywhere!</i> Milo had begged. <i>Things can’t ever be the same if you go, Ollie.</i><br />
<br />
In the end, Milo had no idea if what he said had any effect. Ollie still seemed a bit unsure, at least, and he had asked Milo not to tell anyone about what they had discussed. <i>I’m still decidin’, I guess. Please, just don’t tell nobody, okay? Barnyard buddies, right?</i>, Ollie had said, trying to sound positive but failing miserably. However, against his better judgment, Milo had agreed to keep his silence.<br />
<br />
And now…<br />
<br />
“Milo, what the hell’s the matter?” Dare asked, rising up from the bed and giving the boar’s shoulder a shake. “Don’t tell me… You found out you’ve got a sister, too? Or Will’s got a twin? What is it?”<br />
<br />
Milo kept silent, just as he had agreed. He pulled Dare into a tight hug, pressing the skunk’s nose right into his soft chest fur. “I can’t tell you. I’m so sorry, Dare…” Milo said sadly.<br />
<br />
“Umm… I mean, I’m the last guy that’ll get on your case for being cagey about shit, but are you sure?” Dare replied, his voice muffled by Milo’s fur. “Can’t you even tell Stripes about it?”<br />
<br />
“I wanted to, but he sounded… busy,” Milo said, blushing a bit as he remembered the rhythmic pounding he had heard and the intense scent of sex he’d smelled seeping out from behind their RAs door earlier. It really was hard to keep that sort of thing secret, but Milo still knew better than to interrupt the two of them.<br />
<br />
“…Okay, if you don’t want to say, I understand,” Dare said slowly. He walked back to his bed and sat down, patting the bed and smiling at Milo. It was one of the few times Milo had ever seen Dare smile; the sarcastic skunk tended to sneer, grin, and smirk, but very rarely smile genuinely. Just seeing his skunk’s beautiful smile was enough to calm Milo down just a bit. Milo followed Dare over to the bed and sat down alongside him, leaning over onto the skunk’s shoulder. “Dude, you weigh like 50 pounds more than me, you’re gonna knock me over,” Dare joked, leaning his head against Milo’s.<br />
<br />
“Dare… I think I love-“ Milo started to say, making Dare’s eyes go wide and his ears twitch. “…I love the way you smell. It always makes me feel better, for some reason.”<br />
<br />
Dare burst into laughter at that, having almost gotten his hopes up for a moment. <i>If he did say ‘it’, what would I have said?</i> Dare wondered to himself. <i>Probably something asinine, to be honest.</i><br />
<br />
“Well, you still look like shit, pig. So if it’ll make you feel better, take as big a whiff as you want,” Dare teased, putting his paw on Milo’s leg and gently stroking the boar’s thigh playfully. “…Want a blowjob? I mean, if huffing my pits is enough to make you feel better, getting sucked off’s gotta be enough to cure cancer or something.”<br />
<br />
Even with everything going on, Milo couldn’t help but chuckle at that and shove Dare over onto the bed. “Dare, I blasted about a gallon of boar cum down your throat last night,” Milo bragged, a slight smile creeping back onto his face. “You gotta give me at least 24 hours to replenish my fluids…”<br />
<br />
“You mean we can’t just have non-stop sex?” Dare replied in mock horror. “Fuck it then, this relationship is over. I was just interested in you for your dick, but if I gotta wait <i>that</i> long…”<br />
<br />
<i>God, I really do love this little asshole</i>, Milo thought. As much as he was worried about Ollie and Curtis, at least he had his favorite skunk in the world to help cheer him up. Silence fell back over the two of them as Milo lay down next to Dare on the bed, letting the gentle scent of his roommate’s blankets settle his nerves and help to prepare for whatever was coming next…</p>
