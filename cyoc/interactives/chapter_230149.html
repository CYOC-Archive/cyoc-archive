<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tucker was stuffed inside a machine that to his horror looked like an oven. He wanted to scream, slap the alien&#39;s face and run away. Of course, he was unable to do any of that because the carefully-developed sedative that made him unable to move yet able to feel everything was still in effect.<br />
<br />
Xyllabus the alien pushed and rearranged Tucker&#39;s cumbersome limbs, kicking and squishing them together so the whole puny animal would fit inside the limited space. When he was more or less satisfied with the human flesh&#39;s placement the alien closed the contraption&#39;s lid and made some adjustments on a display.<br />
<br />
When he turned a dial, the inside of the machine began to feel warmer, which only cemented Tucker&#39;s theory that he was inside an oven. He didn&#39;t want to die!<br />
<br />
But to the human&#39;s relief the temperature never rose within unacceptable levels. It actually felt kinda nice... Or at least it would be if it wasn&#39;t so cramped!<br />
<br />
Xyllabus checked his digital watch. &quot;Hmm, it should be done about... Now!&quot; He pressed a button and the lid opened. A lot of white smoke emanated from the machine. The alien crept closer and when he saw what was inside he raised his arms up in the air in joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been a total success! Oh, just look at you, you&#39;re the perfect Sucker!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker blinked in confusion. Wait, blinked? That meant that the sedative had worn off! Now it was his chance to escape! He quickly rose up and jumped away from the strange machine. However, the moment he landed on the floor his leg felt weird. In fact he could only feel one leg and it was very sensitive! The moment he realized this Tucker lost his balance and collapsed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow, you&#39;re an eager little guy, aren&#39;t ya? Just look at you!&quot; Xyllabus took out his cellphone and called someone. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s me. I&#39;m done with the repurposing. No humanity left on it! Yeah, you&#39;ll be able to collect it as soon as possible...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker tried to use his arms to stand back up, but they weren&#39;t responding. The whole clinic looked much bigger. What was happening? Tucker was afraid to move his gaze down... To look down and confirm his fears was a daunting task... But he felt really different and he couldn&#39;t delay the inevitable for long.<br />
<br />
He looked down. He saw a yellow round and bright rubber ball and nothing more... Wait, it wasn&#39;t a ball, it was his torso! Why was it so brightly yellow and rubber-like? Why was it so much rounder and pudgier than before? And most importantly... Why weren&#39;t any arms connected to it?!<br />
<br />
There was another appendage below his yellow torso. He could only assume it was the leg he had tried to stand up on. He shifted his torso and yep, there was his leg... But why instead of a foot he was seeing what looked like a mushroom tip? Oh no.<br />
<br />
Tucker no longer had any legs, either! His penis, however, had been elongated into a leg-sized appendage that was prehensible and he could move and twist at will. It felt really strange, how every single movement of the only &#39;limb&#39; that remained on him felt so arousingly sensitive. His dickhead was oozing precum just by swaying his cock around like a snake&#39;s tail.<br />
<br />
Tucker&#39;s eyes were still looking down in fear and bewilderment at the strangeness of it all when the alien veterinarian smiled a self-sufficient grin at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love it, right? You&#39;re lighter, smaller, and much more resource-efficient than before.&quot; He said as if he were describing a new, fashionable product. &quot;I can tell by the way you&#39;re twisting your genitalia that you&#39;ll love being a Pogonia-9 Sucker, it&#39;s a humble species but it&#39;s growing in demand!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker wanted to tell the alien doctor to go fuck himself. But Tucker&#39;s mouth felt different. It was stretched forward, not unlike a muzzle or a ugly duck&#39;s beak... Well, except his fleshy lips were permanently puckered outwards in a kissing position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suck, suuuck, suck!&quot; Tucker said against his will. His lips were unable to pronounce any intelligible words except for sucking and kissing sounds like those. &quot;Suuuuuuck, suuuuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tucker&#39;s yellow head was comical. While his eyes retained his expression of pure terror for what kind of life awaited him, his ears and nose were simple, unassuming holes, he no longer had any hair on top of his head, his cartoony, colorful form looked like a bad caricature of what an alien was supposed to look like... And there was one more peculiar facial feature: a hollow space where his forehead used to be. It felt like his head ended on a donut, which no doubt could and will be used as a handle to lift his small frame as much as superior alien species needed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suck! Suck!&quot; Tucker pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know you&#39;re eager to give a good sucking!&quot; The alien doctor said, rubbing his crotch through his tight pants. &quot;But that would lessen your value for your new owner... Oh, I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Xyllabus grabbed Tucker by the donut-shaped handle on his head, then used his other hand to grab Tucker&#39;s swaying penis and stuff it down his own throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;SUCK! SUCK! SUCK!&quot; Tucker complained as his big lips tasted his very own cock. However, he was unable to spit out his own penis and the more his mouth complained or his prehensile penis attempted to move, the more Tucker gagged on his own semen.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, that should make you shut up...&quot; The alien doctor said, satisfied that this portable sextoy of a species included a mute function. The ridiculous thing was rubbery, stretchable and pliable, too. And not like it could go anywhere with his only useless limb being a long penis that it only allowed it to jump around like a silly pogo stick or fucking his own mouth. Now wonder that wild Suckers were the most helpless species of wildlife in Pogonia-9 and only their cocksucking skills saved them from being completely demolished from the food chain.<br />
<br />
Tucker was horrorized. His life dream had always been one and the same: revealing the truth about alien life to the world. But now there he was, transformed into a goofy-looking alien himself, trapped in a strange new world ruled by the smug and prideful aliens he had been working so relentlessly to expose.<br />
<br />
Xyllabus placed Tucker upright on the floor, using the long pliable penis he was self-sucking as the base. But the newly-conceived yellow alien couldn&#39;t balance itself, so he fell sideways. Sucking his own penis like that, Tucker looked like a yellow, cartoony rendition of the ancient ouroboros.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t look more pitiful.<br />
<br />
Tears fell down Tucker&#39;s eyes. He was so scared, but he could only sob in silence except for when he literally shat a puddle of wet poop against the wall in such an unmanly spectacle that even the Birdcrappers from Avilar-5 would find thoroughly amusing.<br />
<br />
...Right, turns out he could look even more pitiful.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a mess, maybe I should&#39;ve plugged your penis into your anus instead...&quot; Xyllabus lamented. He took a wipe and cleaned Tucker&#39;s mess. It was at this specific point in time, with the doc sliding his gloved middle finger up the self-sucking alien&#39;s butthole, that the door to the lab opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEY! What are you doing playing around with MY Sucker?&quot; A voice said.<br />
<br />
The alien doctor recognized who the voice belonged to. It was, after all, the one he had talked to on his cellphone just minutes ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chill out, I was just making sure the specimen was in perfect condition for you.&quot; Xyllabus said to...</p>
