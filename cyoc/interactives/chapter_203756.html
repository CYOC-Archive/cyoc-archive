<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Bull, sir,&quot; Grant answered with a smile, &quot;You could say I&#39;m as big and strong as one. I jus&#39; feel a bit of the kinship, you know?&quot; Grant guffawed at his little joke. Though for some reason it seemed Erich wasn&#39;t exactly laughing.<br />
<br />
To tell the truth, this was far from Grant&#39;s first job as a farmhand.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d worked on about four farms before this, and so, he had no reason to attach any suspicion to the actions of the farmer in charge, Erich Reed. Grant Cline was a six foot three inches tall, southern fed lad indeed - all of 21 years old and 225 pounds of mostly muscle. His hair was ruddy dark brown, his skin naturally tanned looking and only more deeply tan and impressive for his work on the farms before. His body had been built up well from the farm work, and only further enhanced by working out in the rudimentary small town gyms that he drifted to. It helped they were pretty cheap!<br />
<br />
His long sleeved t-shirt poorly disguised his powerfully built body and his six pack even showed a bit through the cheap cotton of his shirt. His jeans were specifically chosen for how tight they were over his rear. A pair of tighty-whitey boxers poked out a little from his jeans. Honestly, Grant was despite a front of folksy &quot;ah shucks&quot; wholesomeness keenly aware of how handsome and alluring he was. Quite a few times before, he&#39;d gotten daughters and female farmhands to derelict their duties when the farm head wasn&#39;t home in favor of a fine roll in the hay with Grant.<br />
<br />
He was just thankful he always used protection. He had no desire to end up having to commit to anything. Stopping his trip around the countryside for a kid that just happened to show up as a result of carelessness was not in his agenda.<br />
<br />
Mr. Reed seemed to look Grant over as he led the young man around the farm location, &quot;You are indeed remarkably physically impressive, Mr. Cline. I confess none of my farmhands have quite had your presence of form.&quot; He gave off the impression of being more than impressed. Almost like he was glad in a certain way.<br />
<br />
Grant tilted his head a little as he registered that. He started to wonder if this slim and tall, vaguely German accented figure might well be a little gay. The experienced farmhand surely didn&#39;t swing that way at all - his preferences were with the female persuasion - but he figured if someone was attracted to him he could make use of that. &quot;Few men are willin&#39; to put in the time &#39;n&#39; effort to look this good.&quot; Grant rolled up a sleeve and <i>flexed</i>. <br />
<br />
<i>Eat that up, man</i>, Grant thought with a suppressed cocky sneer as he saw Erich examining his vain display.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes...&quot; Erich nodded as they swung over by the stables, &quot;You are more or less exactly what I needed for the work in and among my bulls. It is my effort to produce larger, stronger cattle. My forebears, the Heck brothers, had their own efforts in father country, and you---you seem like someone who has interest in these sorts of ideas...can I ask that you help me with my plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grant was nowhere near studied enough to know who those two were, but he heard about an effort to produce larger, stronger cattle and his mind went right to the possible end result. If this guy was trying to make some sort of breakthrough, there was money involved. And money that might, if he could charm his way into the confidences of this weirdo, trickle down into the farmhand&#39;s pockets. &quot;You&#39;re the one a&#39;hirin me. I&#39;m good with whatever you need me to do. Breed em, feed em, water em, anythin&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile lit up the wizened and somewhat thin features of the German Rancher, &quot;Yes...yes, I believe this is the beginning of a vundabar friendship.&quot; Looking around as the two of them shook hands on it, Erich motioned at one particular area, &quot;Back here is where I keep my cattle. You&#39;ll be reporting here for your feeding, watering and occasionally, breeding duties. Ensure that everything develops well, Mr. Cline.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can count on me,&quot; Grant smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, I will have you begin tomorrow with your duties,&quot; Erich looked back to the farmhouse he personally lived in, &quot;I would have you join me for dinner and drinks. I would not demand that you work here without any reward, ja?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds agreeable, boss!&quot; Grant shortly followed Erich back inside the house. Not even noticing a few of the cows and bulls inside the building he&#39;d soon be working in making as much of a fuss as possible as Erich led him away. As if they were trying to disrupt things - trying to impart some sort of desperate warning.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
By the time the seemingly neverending feast was done, replete with fine German wines, Grant was left stumbling up to his room per their arrangement - feeling woozy and the best kind of fulfilled. <br />
<br />
If Erich fed him that well every day he&#39;d be happy to keep on working here as long as it took for...whatever the fuck this plan he was working on to be completed. Grant didn&#39;t care what happened at the end of it, nor what he needed to do - so long as he could keep getting meals of that kind of caliber. Though he would need to visit the local gym more regularly to work off the calories.<br />
<br />
Due to the buzz from the wine, Grant didn&#39;t even notice the tingling that would precipitate what was to come over the course of his stay on the farm. Indeed, he wrote off the brief tingling feeling as just the effect of the wine. The room that was allotted to Grant was spacious, with a proper if spartan bed and a window looking out toward the holding stable for the cows. Grant for his part didn&#39;t even bother closing the windows at all.<br />
<br />
He even outright started stripping naked right in front of the window, the buzz making him not even note the fact he&#39;d left the door open. If some lovely lady happened to watch him undressing...well...all the better. As soon as his clothes were off, Grant sensually dragged his hands over his abs - swollen a bit outward from the food intake - and his meaty pectorals. &quot;Can&#39;t wait---can&#39;t wait to find someone to fuck around here. Some lady to take my nice southern eight incher.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning licentiously, Grant pressed his hand against his groin. He was thinking about getting in a nice little wank before bed - properly cum in this new place. Just enjoy himself properly. But due to the alcohol coursing through his body, despite his best efforts he couldn&#39;t maintain a workable erection. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, fuck it,&quot; Grant groaned as he gave up on masturbation that night, &quot;I&#39;ll just jerk off tomorrow morning before the work here starts...&quot; He didn&#39;t even think about the conspicuously generous accommodations and comparatively late start time at 9:30 AM. As far as he was concerned, Erich liked him - was charmed by him - and that just meant the guy was being nice and accommodating toward him.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take Grant long to fall asleep on top of the covers, completely naked. Not even noticing Erich Reed pausing by the door. Looking inside, seeing the denuded Grant snoring away - and shortly after, the German man smiled, and slowly / quietly closed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
By the time the next morning had come...</p>
