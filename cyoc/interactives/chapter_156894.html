<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Several pleasant, sex filled days, have passed since your confrontation with your former master and your acquisition of his tower and all its contents. Your Watchers have reported little activity along the forest borders, and the fawns are settling into their lives quite well. You had shaped the forest before your palace to form a small village for them to call home, complete with canopy roofed lanes and glowing spores to light the way. Already you were thinking up more ways to turn your domain into a real nation.<br />
<br />
Honey had woken, and after a long conversation you were able to put aside your fears that you had inadvertently wiped her mind with a copy of your own. She simply viewed your memories the same way you viewed the memories of the ancient dryads, as if you were watching a play, or reading a story but not as something you had experienced yourself. You had not told her of the mage’s claims that they weren’t your memories at all, but instead had been stolen from a dead man. You weren’t ready to explore that just yet.<br />
<br />
Liana had taken on the task of exploring the mage’s tower and disarming any traps that remained. You are wary of her finding some weapon or spell to use against you, but after your display of power in moving the tower she has been nothing but obedient and even affectionate towards you.<br />
<br />
The babies had grown quite a lot on Karla’s rich milk and already looked six months old. You’d seen them crawling in their playroom just this morning while their motherly minotaur watched over. At this rate they’d be adults in a few months.<br />
<br />
Now, you are in your bed chambers, on your hands and knees, being thoroughly fucked by your loyal fawn buck. You moan blissfully as his long cock pistons in and out of you from behind, his front pair of deer legs clenching against your sides like another of his does. The fragrant aroma of sweet flowers fills the room. You feel his cock thicken and pulse before he cries out and paints your insides with his cum. Immediately you are filled with the familiar tingling as your body absorbs his seed, and you have your own orgasm. Exhausted, the buck climbs from your back and stumbles aside.<br />
<br />
“No more, my Queen, I beg of you,” he pleads. “My orbs are empty!”<br />
<br />
You laugh musically. Delighted and glowing. Eight times was probably enough for one morning, you suppose. “Very well, my beautiful buck,” you say. “Go, rest. Then visit with your herd. I expect to see those does of yours swollen with foals soon.”<br />
<br />
The buck nods, too worn out to speak further, and staggers from your rooms, passing Honey on her way in.<br />
<br />
You greet your daughter and walk over to a pitcher of wine sitting on your table. It wasn’t real wine. Not like your former master used to bring back from his trips. It was a kind of fermented berry juice you’d managed to make. But real or not, it was deliciously sweet and intoxicatingly strong. You pour a cup for Honey as well as one for yourself.<br />
<br />
Honey sips at the wine, then sets the wooden cup aside. “My Queen, the Watchers report intruders heading this way,” she says. You frown and reach out to make a mental connection with your Watcher trees. Distracted by your pleasure you hadn’t been listening to their warnings.<br />
<br />
“I see them,” you say. “Elves? Just two of them?”<br />
<br />
Honey nods. “I can’t detect any others either,” she says. “Is it possible they are hiding themselves somehow?”<br />
<br />
“Possible,” you say. You send a mental command to the fawns to escort the elves to your castle. “But I don’t think that’s the case. Come, let’s greet these visitors in my audience chambers.” <br />
<br />
A short time later, just long enough for you give Honey a body quivering orgasm sucking on her massive, honey filled breasts, a group of fawns bearing wooden spears escorts the two elves before your thorn covered throne. You examine the pair before speaking. A male and a female. Like all elves, they are pale skinned and slender, their fine boned faces framed by manes of thick black hair, their eyes jet black without pupil or whites. <br />
<br />
The male is tall and, while not as large or broad as a human man, his arms and chest are corded with lean muscles beneath his simple white linen shirt. His brown buckskin pants do nothing to conceal his powerful legs or the bulge between them. You decide he must be a hunter, or a warrior, perhaps.<br />
<br />
The female is shorter, and as beautiful as the male is gorgeous. A well-made dress of brown and gold clings to slender shoulders and small, pert tits, ending just above creamy thighs that end in dainty, sandaled feet. You think she might be from a wealthy family, based on that dress, until you notice the short finger nails and callused toes.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to my domain,” you greet them, rising from your throne and opening your arms wide. You can feel both their eyes on your naked body. “I am curious what brings two stunningly beautiful elves to my castle.”<br />
<br />
The female steps forward and bows low. “Your majesty,” she says. You smile. So, the last group of trespassers have been spreading their story. Good. “We have come on behalf of the elves of Nor’darish to beg an alliance of our peoples.”<br />
<br />
Her answer stuns you for a moment. An alliance? Between the elves and the dryads? And Nor’darish? Was that the name of the village on the other side of the forest? Karla had never mentioned it and now you were kicking yourself for not asking her when you had the chance.<br />
<br />
“My name is Enna,” she continues. “And this is my companion and bodyguard, Guntmar. We have travelled from the human village beyond your borders in the hopes that our goals may align.”<br />
<br />
“Be welcome, Enna, Guntmar,” you say, nodding to each. “I must say, I am surprised by your words. I had expected my next visitors to come bearing torches and swords, not offers of alliance.”<br />
<br />
“Your majesty, the humans indeed plan an attack on your forest, but they have not yet gathered enough men brave enough,” Enna says. “But a rider has been sent to the city of Kef, requesting the lords’ assistance.”<br />
<br />
You laugh at the thought of the humans sitting in some tavern pissing themselves with fear as your story spreads. Excellent, things were going just as you had planned. Kef was several days ride away, based on the maps you had studied as an apprentice mage, and the local lord would be slow to send soldiers to a distant village. You had plenty of time to put the next stage of your plans in motion.<br />
<br />
“This is welcome news,” you say. Then, at Enna’s confused look, “It will take weeks for any soldiers to arrive from Kef. By then I plan to be in complete control of the forest and the lands surrounding it. But tell me, what is it exactly you hope we can offer to one another?”<br />
<br />
Enna tells her story. A story of how the elves once resided, immortal, in a realm they called the Fey, crossing into this world and others for fun. But on one such crossing they encountered humans. The humans had gifted the elves with treasures and feasts, then begged the elves return the pleasure by inviting them back to the Fey. The elves had greatly enjoyed their time with the humans, so they agreed. But on arriving in the Fey the humans stole the secret of the realm’s magic for themselves, causing it collapse and forcing the elves to flee back to this world. Then, trapped and bereft of magic, the elves found themselves at the mercy of the humans who treated them like garbage. So began generations of elves living as servants to the humans.<br />
<br />
When she is finished, she takes a step back and waits for you to speak. You consider her story. It is true that elves can’t use magic, but it doesn’t line up with the history you were taught. Your history books had stated that elves and humans had long shared the continent, either in harmony or conflict depending on the age but nothing about magical fairy realms or stolen magics though.<br />
<br />
“So, you want me to help you over throw the humans and restore your realm?” you ask. There are a lot of elves living on the continent. Gaining their alliance would be a huge boon but you don’t know the first thing about crossing between worlds.<br />
<br />
Enna shakes her head. “The Fey and our magic is gone. We gave up on ever regaining either one long ago. We merely want to be free of our human oppressors.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I can absolutely give you magic,” you say. “But I have no problem with the humans so long as they stay out of my forest.”<br />
<br />
“Your majesty, don’t you see the best way to protect your forest is – wait, did you just say you can give us our magic back?” Enna asks, her mouth agape.<br />
<br />
“Not your magic,” you clarify. “But I can give you some of mine. You wouldn’t be immortal fairies or whatever, but you’d at least be on par with any human mage. You’d have to pledge yourself to me first, of course”<br />
<br />
“I… your maj-“ Enna starts.<br />
<br />
Guntmar steps forward and kneels before you, cutting Enna off. “Your majesty,” he says. His voice is deep and rich. “If you can grant me the magic of my ancestors than I will give you my life until my dying breath.”<br />
<br />
You sigh, slump down in your throne and cross one long leg over the other. “As I said. I cannot give you your ancestral magic. What I can offer you is something different even from what the humans use. My magic is ancient and wild. Primal.”<br />
<br />
“Guntmar!” cries Enna. “What are you doing? What of Nor’darish? You can’t forsake your people!”<br />
<br />
“I am not forsaking my people, Princess Enna. With magic I can stand up to the humans and their mages,” he says loudly, almost shouting.<br />
<br />
“Princess is it?” you ask, raising an eyebrow at Enna. “Now that is interesting. I wasn’t aware the elves had any royalty.”<br />
<br />
“We-we don’t!” says Enna. Guntmar’s actions have left her flustered. “It’s an old title, from the days of Fey.”<br />
<br />
“Enna is of the royal line, my Queen,” says Guntmar. “Her family has ruled the Nor’darish in secret for a thousand years.”<br />
<br />
“Guntmar!” Enna cries.<br />
<br />
“Very well, Guntmar. If you are serious about acquiring my magic, you must agree to two conditions,” you say. “First, you must pledge your loyalty to me as your Queen and vow to obey my every command. Second, you must be willing to pay a cost. This cost will change you, make you able to use my magic. In exchange I will allow you to use your magic how you see fit, so long as it does not go against any of my commands. Do you agree?”<br />
<br />
“I agree, my Queen. I pledge myself to you and accept any cost,” he says, still kneeling on the floor before your throne.<br />
<br />
“And what of you, Princess Enna?” you ask. “Will you accept my offer? Will you gain the power you so desperately desire to free your people?”<br />
<br />
“What you ask is too much!” Enna says. She is distraught. All her plans are falling apart around her. “You ask me to betray my people!”<br />
<br />
“Yes!” you shout. “So you can save them!”<br />
<br />
With a strangled wail, Enna throws herself to the floor before you. She looks up at you and you see tears streaming from her eyes. “I agree!” she cries. “I give myself to you, Queen of the forest.”</p>
