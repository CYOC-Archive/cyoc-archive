<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate thinking on what his father said; decides to leave the issue with his paw prints alone. His father was right; Nate wasn’t the only were to be out at night. Several were&#39;s were walking about as he drove home. Heading to the kitchen to eat some of the lamb leftover for him; Nate looks out the window to see Eric, Spencer and Frieda use the exterior entrance of the basement to slip away into the woods.<br />
“Now what could those three be up to,” Nate wonders.<br />
<br />
Running deep into the woods; Eric, Frieda and Spencer stop in a small clearing. Enjoying the cold crisp air and the clear night sky; Eric was half tempted to start fondling his girlfriends. Spencer sensing Eric’s lust puts up a paw to stop him.<br />
“Let the night air fill your lungs,” Spencer calmly stating; “focus on what you smell.”<br />
“I smell you and Frieda,” Eric answers.<br />
“Focus past that Eric,” Spencer speaking; “let the wind speak to you. What does it say?”<br />
Eric inhaling deeply as Frieda and Spencer are now behind him; “I smell a deer? Is that what I smell?”<br />
“Yes,” Spencer answering; “but I can smell it is pregnant, we won’t hunt it as it has life swelling in its belly. Smell the wind again.”<br />
“An Elk! No,” Eric sniffing again; “Moose?”<br />
“No,” Spencer grinning; “it’s another deer. But this one is a buck.”<br />
“Oh,” Eric sniffing again; “the scent is getting stronger!”<br />
“It’s coming to us,” Frieda speaking?<br />
“Yes,” Spencer whispers; “into the brush, we’ll pounce and ambush it.”<br />
<br />
As the three hide, the male deer entered into the clearing; Eric getting a good look at the animal, sees that it had four points on its antlers. Tensing as the deer comes closer; Eric could smell its breathe as it exhales. Inhaling the buck stops; twitching his ears the buck looks nervous. Eric staring at it intently; he pounces as the buck turns around. Landing on top of the animal he holds on with his claws already bared and digging into the flesh. The four point buck in full flight mode, struggles to run off with the predator weighing it down; Trying to kick and buck Eric off; Eric manages to quickly get a better grip, allowing him to remain on top, just as Spencer and Frieda also strike. While Frieda baring her claws and fangs as the deer ran into her; Spencer struck, wrapping her arms around the buck’s neck and snapping it in an instant.<br />
<br />
The buck slumps over lifeless as Eric jumps off; Feeling a rush of power as he stares at the animals lifeless eyes, Spencer rips into the animals flesh exposing internal organs and spilling blood.<br />
“It’s a young one,” Spencer ripping out the liver and taking a bite and looking at Eric and Frieda, “don’t just stand there, enjoy the fruits of your first hunt.”<br />
“Spencer,” Frieda looking stunned; “you weren’t kidding on hunting.”<br />
“Well I did remember you bringing up hunting in the woods last night at the gathering,” Spencer taking another bite of the liver; “I figured you’d wanted to do one.”<br />
“I was trying to get a rise out of father,” Frieda exclaiming; “besides, the biggest game I ever bagged was a rabbit.”<br />
Spencer chuckles; “now you helped take down a young buck. Now come on, try this liver its good.”<br />
“I got the heart,” Eric standing back up; his fur covered in blood as he bite down, splashing blood on Spencer and Frieda.<br />
<br />
“And you made a mess,” Nate in his werewolf fursona approaching the three. “Have to admit though, I was surprised to see you three take down the animal so quickly.”<br />
“You hunted,” Eric looking at his brother?<br />
“With my pack,” Nate chuckling; “yes, but we always reported our kills to Moon Lake’s animal control.”<br />
“Why do that;” Spencer looking at the werewolf before them?<br />
“So they can keep an accurate count of the wildlife in and around the area,” Nate is smiling; “believe it or not, what you three did isn’t illegal, despite hunting season being over. As weres, we do hunt from time to time. Most do catch and release,” Nate looking at the dead buck before him; “But it looks like you three were looking for more than just a bit of exercise.”<br />
“I won’t deny,” Eric munching on the heart his white fur deeply stained in blood; “we did get hungry after having a good rut in the basement.”<br />
Nate laughs; “that tends to do it. But do you plan on eating the entire carcass or just a few select pieces?”<br />
 “We could always take it back home,” Eric finishing off the heart.<br />
“Dad would be thrilled with that,” Nate answers sarcastically; “with you three having such robust appetites, I’d wager you would eat roughly half of the meat off this animal before feeling sated.”<br />
“Not if we rut some more,” Eric grinning; with his fur stained blood, he looked meanicing; “that should build up our appetite again.”<br />
Nate laughs; “nope, you would pass out feeling exhausted. Content but exhausted.”<br />
“Your brother is not wrong,” Spencer ripping some more flesh from the carcass; “take it from me, this is not the first time I hunted game and had sex afterwards.”<br />
“Plus remember last night,” Frieda also ripping off a hunch of meat and devouring it; after we had that post nap snack, we all fell asleep after another round. Despite only having six hours sleep; it was restful and fulfilling.”<br />
<br />
Eric; digesting the information as well as more of the animal he helped take down had to nod with what his brother Nate and his girlfriend’s Spencer and Frieda mentioned. With only being a were for a little over a week; he was still adjusting to his enhanced senses and increased libido. The increase in strength, stamina and agility was a plus. But what Eric did notice was his confidence; coming out of his shell after becoming a were, he stopped being the introverted nerd.<br />
“So brother,” Eric asking; “you hungry?”<br />
Nate laughs, “first Elk, than lamb and now some venison; sure I’ll join you for a bit.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
A full thirty minute later; Eric Spencer and Frieda were feeling full from their impromptu snack. Getting up they stare at the carcass that was once the four point buck they claimed; with Nate also joining in on the feast, they managed to consume a little over half of the animal. Walking back home Eric speaks up.<br />
“Just out of curiosity; how quickly would your pack finish eating that deer we got?”<br />
“While my pack isn’t freakishly large like the were-panther pride you belong to Eric,” Nate speaking; “we number around twenty werewolves. We would have had that animal down to bare bones and still be hungry in the time it took for you three to have your fill.”<br />
“What’s the biggest buck you hunted then,” Spencer asking?<br />
Nate smiles; “fourteen point. But it was a catch and release hunt with Ben and Alex. We did catch a few rabbits snaked on those after.” Nate grinning; “but with the full pack; we took down a grizzly.”<br />
“When was that,” Eric asking?<br />
“A couple weeks after I became a werewolf,” Nate smiling; “it was my first hunt and it was a rush.”<br />
“I felt thrilled after the hunt I just had,” Eric patting his belly; “despite Spencer dealing the killing blow.”<br />
“Unlike you Eric,” Spencer grinning; “I’ve had experience hunting. My first kill was a fourteen point buck; but I had help with my father and grandfather.”<br />
<br />
Approaching the back yard Nate looks the three young were’s all bloodied but clearly happy; “I give you the number for Moon Lake’s animal control, you need to report to them the animal you three took down, where the kill took place and your were-species.”<br />
“What about the rest of the carcass,” Frieda asking; “is it collected by animal control?”<br />
“No,” Nate answers; “by now the coyote pack and some foxes that live in and around town will scavenge the rest of the carcass. Nature will claim the rest.”<br />
“Were-coyote,” Eric asking?<br />
“No,” Nate chuckling; “regular coyotes. Oh and before you three go sleep after rutting; you might want to shower first. Wash all that blood off, especially you Eric. With white fur, any stain is going to show like a pimple on the nose.”</p>
