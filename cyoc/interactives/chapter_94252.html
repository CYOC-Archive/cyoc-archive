<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As May considered what activity they might enjoy first, a funny little thought entered into her head: her mother had turned herself into a 17 year old girl, so why shouldn&#39;t she become a 40 year old woman? While it might be great to enjoy the company of a friend her age, May figured she could do that pretty much every school day and weekend when meeting with her friends. This resort was a once in a lifetime opportunity and she should make the most of it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, mom?&quot;, May began to ask. But Morgan quickly corrected her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, May, call me Morgan. Right now I&#39;m not your mom, I&#39;m your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, okay then, Morgan. I was wondering: how would you feel if I became your age?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Morgan blinked in confusion. &quot;But, why would you want to be old like me?&quot; Ordinarily, Morgan would not have considered herself old, but her new youthful form somewhat affected her perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; May explained, &quot;it&#39;s just that I&#39;m used to hanging out with teens like myself, just like you&#39;re used to hanging out with ladies your age. But I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be an adult, and you probably barely remember what it was like to be a teen. I figure a little age swap might help us get to understand each other&#39;s point of view a little better, y&#39;know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan mulled the proposal over and concluded that May did have a point: they may have been very close, but they were still worlds apart, which is completely understandable. Morgan did her best to be to all of May&#39;s soccer, softball and hockey games, but couldn&#39;t always make them like she used to. May was also a well-behaved child and always listened to her mother, and shockingly, Morgan never had to lay her hands on May to discipline her. For some reason or another, May just got it. Perhaps it was how Morgan carried herself, wanting her daughter to learn and make sure she didn&#39;t mess up. May always helped out around the house, but like most teens, May was forgetful, but always did her best to please her mother. May was always modest and self-conscious about her body, not wanting to show much skin if she could help it. Most of the girls wore skanky clothes, shirts and even thongs, while she had always worn plain whites, but oddly never got mocked for it. That wasn&#39;t May at all. Sure, some were her friends but she knew the looks guys would give them, none of which genuine and made sure not to be like that.  She liked being able to go out on her own, but had no issue if her mother wanted to tag along or if her mother wanted her to accompany her. They were distant from most, if not, their other family members so the other was mostly all they had. Still, May was going to be a senior this year in high school and this wasn&#39;t gonna be an easy transition for either one. They SELDOM argued and if they did, it was always very minor, nothing ever came of it and they quickly made up. Maybe this would get them both to understand the life event that would take place for them next summer. Unknown to both of them, as Morgan considered these things, underneath her shirt her navel became the bearer of a brand new piercing. Morgan only noticed that now that she was a teenager, she was indeed able to look at things with a fresh perspective. Who knows what it might do for May then! This could drastically improve their relationship!<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay May, you win. Let&#39;s do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
May&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;EEE! Thanks sis!&quot;<br />
<br />
She closed her eyes and concentrated like she had seen her mother do. Her only thoughts were about becoming 40 years old.<br />
<br />
The effect was immediately visible: May raced through adulthood. For a minute, her chest and hips filled out, she had a quick growth spurt and her face became prettier than ever. Then things began to deteriorate: fat started piling up here and there, muscles reduced, her breasts began to sag somewhat, her face started showing wrinkles and her hair grey streaks as it settled in a haircut that could only be described as &quot;mom hair&quot;. Her secret navel piercing, at the moment invisible to both, vanished into thin air. Her clothing too, changed to match and became more like what Morgan had been wearing before her regression. Gone was the short sleeved shirt, replaced with a more conservative long-sleeved shirt. The skirt made way for some comfy long pants, and the sneakers and anklet socks disappeared in favor of a simple pair of slippers, perfect for walking around the resort in. Morgan was speechless. Just like she had turned out an almost exact copy of her daughter, so too did her daughter make it seem like Morgan was looking in a mirror. Then May opened her eyes again and their most distinct difference became obvious again. To the world, it would have looked as if they had swapped eye colors, when in fact this was pretty much the only thing they hadn&#39;t swapped!<br />
<br />
May quickly turned toward a mirror to see the result. &quot;Oh my gosh! I look almost exactly like you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that you do. Funny how genetics work, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say.&quot;<br />
<br />
May looked at her younger mother who was now a few inches smaller than her. As she noticed Morgans attire, it very much reflected how May was, in a way. May was quite modest, and never wore tank tops or some of the shorts that some girls these days liked flaunting. May seldom wore jeans as well, preferring athletic pants and basketball shorts, along with shirts a size or so too big, so her waistline wasn&#39;t exposed. May was very different from Morgan as a teen. Morgan had zero to no parental influence and while Morgan usually didn&#39;t butt into May&#39;s personal life, she at the very least knew her daughter, and very well at that. It was then that May knew she had made the right choice in aging to a 40 year old. She never really knew how her mom felt, until now. This was definitely going to improve their relationship.<br />
<br />
&quot;So May, you ready to hit the town now?&quot;, Morgan asked with noticable anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Morgan, I was thinking: since I&#39;m older now and you&#39;re younger, how about you just call me Mom for the duration of our vacation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... Well, I suppose it could help us learn about walking a mile in each others shoes... Yeah, sure, okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, WHO?&quot;, May emphasized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... Mom&quot;, Morgan answered with only a hint of uncertainty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Maybe it&#39;s best too if I hang on to the purse...&quot;, May continued. However, Morgans purse seemed to have somehow moved itself to Mays bedside. A quick look inside also revealed that, judging by the documents, the purse and its contents belonged to May Schroeder, age 40. When they went to look in their suitcases, their clothes turned out to also have changed. They had been told this would happen, but it seemed more like May and Morgans outfits had literally been swapped rather than adapted to their current form.<br />
<br />
The new mother-and-daughter pair picked out an evening outfit and proceeded towards the door, ready to go out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you looking forward to this &quot;Morgan&quot;?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet, &quot;Mom&quot;!&quot;</p>
