<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was slowly starting to think about where he was and where his time had gone. He&#39;d...hibernated. He&#39;d broken the ice on the pond and swam to the bottom and slept for the winter! He never knew that the Chronivac would be able to do something like that. But here he was. Swimming around after instinctively eating some bird that had been flitting around like that. He had to get a better look at how he was---<br />
<br />
Groaning and pulling himself out of the pond, Jeff waited for the water to settle before trying to get a look at how he looked now.<br />
<br />
And what he saw made him pull back a little bit. He saw himself, not bald and with ears flush to his head, eyes apparently given a transparent eyelid to help adjust to the sunlight. His skin was a very light green coloration, and Jeff could see that his muscles even after the hibernation were in great shape. Better even than what he remembered getting from that initial change. His stomach was bright yellow in contrast to the light green of the rest of his body, and he ran a hand across his abs, noting it seemed he definitely still had the musculature of a human guy.<br />
<br />
His face though was slightly wider, and there was something off about his neck. If he had to guess that was something that&#39;d let him croak or something. Jeff had no interest in pursuing that end of his biology at the time. He examined his hands and feet, noting the humanoid structure seemed to be maintained, but with noticeable webbing and a slight deformation at the finger and toe tips.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed when he realized his hair really truly was probably gone for good. Ah well, he figured, this meant he could probably save on costs for getting haircuts and stuff like that. Also seemed the hair on his body and his eyebrows was also gone. Kinda left him looking a little odd. Jeff felt an inclination to get back into the pond...but for now he ignored it.<br />
<br />
The changed teen felt like he needed to get a look around and see if anything else changed.<br />
<br />
What he wasn&#39;t expecting was to see a car driving up to the front of his house from his perspective back near the pond, and his girlfriend getting out and immediately heading over to see him. He blushed a little bit, realizing that he was only wearing a speedo at the present. However as she approached him, she didn&#39;t seem to find that all that unusual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jeff! A bit late this year, you sleep well?&quot; Everyone always thought the pairing of Lily and Jeff was kind of odd. Beautiful, rich girl Lily and awkward loner Jeff just didn&#39;t seem like a likely pairing. But now...well, at least Jeff was in better shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh yeah, I guess.&quot; So this was now normal, Jeff figured. He didn&#39;t want to freak anyone out, so he decided to just run with it for the time, &quot;Sorry about that, Lil. I guess the mud down there was pretty nice. Missed you, though. Had so many dreams about what we were gonna do once I got up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, thanks Jeffy,&quot; Lily said, and then the two started walking back toward Jeff&#39;s house, away from the pond, &quot;Would you be up to bring in the Spring with a date today?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck, Jeff thought, how would a date work with my new body? Just the idea of going out... would he be dressed or would it be normal for him to walk around in this speedo? And how would he handle a frog&#39;s need to be wet at certain intervals? Jeff decided to figure this out on his own, but he was really looking forward to dating Lily now with his new and improved body. Sure it was kind of odd, but now he actually looked muscular and strong. Probably the best swimmer in the state too!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, a date sounds great, Lily.&quot; Jeff responded after his pause, and then said, &quot;You up for a swim later, maybe after the date?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds amazing, Jeffy.&quot; Lily said and then kissed him on the lips, making Jeff grin a little bit and feel like a prince in the moment. She then started to head off, back toward her car, &quot;I&#39;ll get ready for our date! Looking forward to it, big guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
As she drove off, Jeff decided to head back into the house and see how much else had changed. As he entered he saw his mother was still fully human, and he guessed that the device just changed him. She said to him, &quot;Remember to keep yourself hydrated, Jeff. I don&#39;t want to hear about you straining yourself out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes, figuring he needed to keep that in mind but deciding he could probably get away with a long romantic date with Lily and maybe even some...late night fun with her too. He&#39;d need to check and see if Lil Jeff still worked the same. He shrugged, &quot;Sure thing mom. I&#39;ll keep it in mind. Thanks for the reminder.&quot; And with that Jeff headed to his room.<br />
<br />
He was pleased to see his clothes were still in there, but it looked like they were made of different fabric. Probably for the sake of handling continued wetness. It seemed most of his underwear was replaced with sleek speedos, and Jeff also noted there was now a shower room connected to his bedroom. He guessed for the sake of making sure he could have access to water quickly. The window in his room was also modified to let him easily head out through it to get to the backyard pond.<br />
<br />
Jeff took a seat on his bed and thought about where to go from here...</p>
