<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh decided to save the idea of becoming a tiny mouse woman for later.  For now, it was Yuki&#39;s human body that he had been interested in.  How ironic that it would now become <i>his</i> body, rather than one he&#39;d get to grab and hold in his arms.  Not only would it allow him to get closer to Andrew&#39;s friends, but he&#39;d get to enjoy Yuki&#39;s body in ways he wouldn&#39;t be able to as a separate person.<br />
<br />
Having changed the new Yuki back into a human, he was about to confirm the changes, but paused for thought.  He was already altering reality and everyone&#39;s memories, for the sake of creating a Josh-flavored Yuki.  Why not make Yuki into Andrew&#39;s second non-human friend?<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want to change too much.  Josh was attracted to Yuki&#39;s face and body, and didn&#39;t want to change those.  Inspired by art he&#39;d seen lately, he decided to change her into a demi-human.  Change Yuki&#39;s ears into mouse ears, give her a mouse tail, and clawed hands and feet.  Done!<br />
<br />
Josh was briefly disoriented as he exited the transformation void, shaking his head as he tried to sort through two sets of memories.  He looked around, expecting to find himself next to Andrew.  But neither Andrew nor her friends were there.  In fact, he realized that he wasn&#39;t even the reception area.  Then, something clicked, and she recognized where she was.  This was where she wound up after fleeing from Andrew.  Of course, thanks to Josh&#39;s memories, she now knew that the white tiger was Andrew.<br />
<br />
Away from her friends and fiancé, she decided to look over herself.  First looking at her hands, they were petite as always, though now her fingers were tipped with claws.  Maybe now she could help Maya claw the faces of anyone who bothers them.  Though neither Josh nor herself were the confrontational types.<br />
<br />
Looking down to her chest, she saw her small breasts, now covered by a plain T-shirt instead of the butterfly print shirt she had arrived in.  Seems she now shared Josh&#39;s tastes in clothing.  She cupped her breasts in her hands.  They felt somewhat normal to her, as they were the same breasts she had since her teenage years.  Though she also now remembered life as a flat-chested male.  That side of her brought an odd joy at having her own pair of breasts to freely grab, and her tail twitched in excitement.<br />
<br />
That reflex brought attention to her brand new appendage.  She reached back to grab it, noting how her jeans now were tailor-made for it.  Holding her tail out in front in her hands, she admired how it looked, and how it felt.  Not only feeling it with her hands, but the feeling of it being held in her hands.  This was <i>her</i> tail.  Not Andrew&#39;s, but hers.  It was strange to think how much she enjoyed having one, as she never considered it much before, even being around Maya.  But it seemed like she had a newfound love for transformation.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered the other change made by Josh.  Letting go of her tail (it tugged at its base slightly as it dangled), she reached up to rub her enlarged ears.  She had no way of looking at them until she found a mirror, but their size was ever-apparent, as the crowd around her was quite audible, now.<br />
<br />
It was then that she realized her current situation.  She was away from her friends and fiancé, lost in a crowd of resort guests, many of whom were taller than her.  And she felt... fine.  Normally, she hates crowds.  But now that she has Josh&#39;s personality, it was like her anxieties had been washed away.  In a way, they actually were.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, something dawned on Yuki.  Replaying the past few minutes in her mind, she realized that she had been thinking of herself as Yuki, not Josh.  It made sense, since this <i>was</i> her body (alterations aside), and heck, she even still has the same name.  But the entire point of overwriting her personality with his was so that he could become her while mentally remaining himself.<br />
<br />
Yuki chuckled as she realized what this meant.  Despite Josh&#39;s best efforts, he had indeed become a different person.  In a way, she felt like she had just thwarted his plans to take over her life.  Granted, she knew that she and Josh were now the same person, but she liked the idea of Josh&#39;s life being changed like that.  Even better that she was aware of both lives to enjoy it.  She supposed her enjoyment was due to her now having Josh&#39;s personality.  She remembered how Josh had changed a few people earlier in the day, and how fun that was.  She herself will likewise continue to do so.<br />
<br />
She briefly considered going into the transformation void and undoing Josh&#39;s personality change, so Josh would wholly become her.  But something in the back of her mind prevented her from attempting that.  Though she felt fine with her new self, a part of her was still afraid to become a different person, even if it was a personality she had before.  And she really was fine with her new self.  She may have Josh&#39;s personality instead of her own, but she felt so much better not being the shy girl she was before.<br />
<br />
It was then that her phone dinged.  She reached for her purse to pull it out, only to realize that her purse was gone.  Then she remembered that Josh usually kept his phone in his left pocket.  Sure enough, there it was.<br />
<br />
On it was a message from Sasha.  &quot;K, see you when you get here.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was an odd response considering Yuki had just sent a message asking if they were okay.  Looking at her own message, though, she saw that reality had changed it.  &quot;I&#39;ll join y&#39;all soon.  Right now I&#39;m in the...</p>
