<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Balloon Goon gleefully floated around his three enormous, bloated naked prisoners, his laughter echoing through the air as the giant, inflated Cyber Space Warriors bobbed helplessly. Alex, Luke, and Carl swayed in the breeze like oversized blimps, their round, swollen bodies wobbling with each gust of wind. Their attempts to move were futile; their stubby, wobbling limbs had puffed up so much that they could barely twitch, let alone escape.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you three are perfect!” the Balloon Goon tickled their erections and squealed with delight. “I’ve never had balloon pals as big and bouncy as you three!”<br />
<br />
Just as he was about to start bouncing them in the air like beach balls, a shadow loomed over the scene. The Badboy Baboon strode forward, his arms crossed and an annoyed scowl on his face. Kenny, still by his side, flicked his toothpick and sneered, mimicking the Baboon’s bad attitude.<br />
<br />
“Hey! What do you think you’re doing, Balloon Brain?” the Baboon snarled, pointing an accusatory finger. “These little pests are my prisoners, not yours! I had them all teeny tiny in my gym bag where they belong!”<br />
<br />
The Balloon Goon, taken aback, floated down to face the Baboon. “Yours? I don’t think so, fuzzball! I found them, and now they’re mine! We had a deal. They agreed to be my balloon pals.”<br />
<br />
“They agreed because you tricked ‘em,” the Baboon growled, stepping closer. His chest puffed out as he loomed over the smaller Balloon Goon. “And even if they did, I caught them first, fair and square. Besides, what are you gonna do with them, huh? You gonna float them around for fun? I had real plans for these losers.”<br />
<br />
Kenny piped in, leaning on the Baboon’s side with a smirk. “Yeah, man. Let’s not forget, these punks are ours to mess with. I was thinkin’ we could, like, make ‘em clean my room or somethin’. Maybe get them to do my chores for once.”<br />
<br />
Alex, still inflated and floating helplessly nearby, tried to shout something in protest, but all that came out was a pathetic squeak of helium.<br />
<br />
The Balloon Goon scoffed, ignoring the warriors’ feeble noises. “Please! Cleaning your room? That’s so lame! With my balloon pals, we could go soaring across the city, bouncing off rooftops! We’d have way more fun than making them do your dumb chores.”<br />
<br />
The Baboon bristled, his temper flaring. “Fun?! Who cares about fun? You think Lord Skullface’s gonna be happy with you goofin’ around while I had these guys right where I wanted ‘em?”<br />
<br />
The Balloon Goon floated back slightly, his cheeks puffing up in frustration. “Oh, you think Lord Skullface cares about some boring gym bag plan? Come on! He’d love the idea of these guys being humiliated as balloon freaks!”<br />
<br />
The argument escalated, both monsters bickering and shoving each other. The Badboy Baboon grabbed at the transformation remote, waving it threateningly. “I’m in charge here, Balloon Goon. Hand ‘em over, or I’ll deflate you right where you float!”<br />
<br />
The Balloon Goon gasped, his round body trembling. “You wouldn’t dare!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I would.” The Baboon’s eyes gleamed with menace as his finger hovered over the remote’s button.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alex, Luke, and Carl were caught in the middle of the heated confrontation. They bobbed awkwardly in the air, their bodies so swollen they couldn’t do much more than watch helplessly. Their oversized forms wobbled with every movement the monsters made, and the faint smell of the Baboon’s dirty laundry still clung to them, making the whole experience even more unbearable.<br />
<br />
Luke, his voice now a high-pitched squeak, at last managed to mutter, “We’ve got to get that remote back…”<br />
<br />
Carl, struggling to keep his balance as his giant, round body swayed and rotated, wheezed, “Easier said… than done…”<br />
<br />
As the Balloon Goon and Badboy Baboon’s argument reached a fever pitch, Kenny crossed his arms, a bored look on his face. “Why don’t we just split ‘em up, huh? I’ll take Alex, and you two can fight over the other dorks.”<br />
<br />
Both the Baboon and the Balloon Goon turned to Kenny, considering the suggestion. For a moment, it seemed like the argument might calm down, but then both monsters spoke at once: “No way!” they shouted, each pulling at the remote in a tug-of-war.<br />
<br />
The remote sparked as the two creatures wrestled over it, their tugging growing more frantic. Sparks of energy shot out, hitting random objects and nearby bystanders—a nearby car inflated like a balloon itself, floating off into the sky. A traffic cop shrank into a little boy.<br />
<br />
“Give it to me!” the Baboon roared, jerking the remote.<br />
<br />
“It’s mine!” the Balloon Goon screeched, refusing to let go.<br />
<br />
Amidst the chaos, the Cyber Space Warriors could only watch as the two monsters’ squabble threatened to get even worse. They knew that if they didn’t act soon, they might be stuck as helpless, bloated balloons forever—or worse, end up as pawns in one of the villains’ ridiculous schemes.<br />
<br />
“Guys,” Alex wheezed, “we’ve got to do something…before they destroy us and the whole city…” He flapped his useless flubbery arms and legs but couldn&#39;t seem to get any traction.<br />
<br />
As the Badboy Baboon and Balloon Goon wrestled over the transformation remote, their tug-of-war grew more chaotic, sending wild sparks of energy flying through the air. One stray bolt of energy shot toward the three inflated warriors, striking Alex, Luke, and Carl directly.<br />
<br />
“Uh-oh…” Alex squeaked, his bloated, balloon-like body trembling as the energy crackled over him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a loud, unexpected sound erupted from Carl’s over-inflated body. PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT!<br />
<br />
Carl’s eyes widened in shock as he felt his puffy butt cheeks vibrate with a loud, obnoxious balloon fart. His body began to deflate like a leaky balloon. &quot;Oh man, this is not how I imagined this would go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before long, Luke and Alex followed suit, the embarrassing sounds filling the air as their enormous, swollen bodies began to deflate rapidly to their long, loud farts. Their cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and disbelief as they felt themselves shrinking, the farting noises echoing as their round, balloon-like forms shrank back to normal. Ffffttt… pfffft!<br />
<br />
The sounds continued as the warriors wobbled in mid-air, their bodies quickly losing their puffed-up, round shapes. They spun helplessly for a moment, caught in a whirlwind of deflation, their bodies getting more taut and toned with every comical blast of air. The warriors flailed their arms and legs, but soon found themselves shrinking back down to their original sizes. <br />
<br />
“Dude, I think we’re getting our bods back!” Carl said, a mix of relief and disbelief in his voice as he felt his limbs return to their normal proportions.<br />
<br />
Luke, now back to his regular self, sighed as he stretched out his arms, grateful to feel solid muscle instead of the squishy, overinflated form he had moments earlier. “That was the weirdest thing ever…” He glanced down and bobbed his still raging erection. &quot;Man, I still feel so horny. When&#39;s that going to wear off?&quot;<br />
<br />
His buddies too were still ridgidly aroused. Alex, now fully back to his original athletic body, shook his head and looked around. “We&#39;ll have to worry about that later. At least we&#39;re not blimps anymore!”<br />
<br />
The three warriors, now standing in the middle of the chaos, exchanged relieved glances. They were back to their normal selves at last. But before they could celebrate, they realized the argument between the Badboy Baboon and the Balloon Goon was still raging on nearby.<br />
<br />
“We need to get that remote!” Alex said, now focused and ready for action. &quot;But we lost our transformation watches. We&#39;ll have to be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
With their bodies back to normal and a new determination in their eyes, the Teenage Cyber Space Warriors knew it was time to take down their bickering enemies and retrieve the device before any more embarrassing or bizarre transformations could happen again.</p>
