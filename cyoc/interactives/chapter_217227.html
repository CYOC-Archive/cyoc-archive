<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ernie & Tim can&#39;t believe they really did what they wished for. Sure their underpants shrunk with them, so they are still decent. <br />
<br />
(Ernie) Hey Tim, what do you think we&#39;d explore a bit about our new surroundings? <br />
<br />
(Tim) Sure thing, sounds like fun!<br />
<br />
They estimate they are maybe around 10 inches tall. Walking together in the living room. they can see some stuff under the couch such as candy wrappers, some dust, and dead flies. Yeah deep cleaning sounds not to be the household priority there.  Suddenly,  somebody knocks at the door. They have no idea who&#39;s there, not expecting anyone that day.  But the door was not locked and the person gets inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Guys, it&#39;s Kevin. Hum mm... sorry if I entered... well  I&#39;ve been told to come over to borrow your GoPro camera for my school film project.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Ernie) It rings a bell, I totally forgot about it, let stay hidden under the couch, he may leave eventually, «whispering to Tim»  <br />
<br />
Kevin is a very smart 12 years old boy, but also very cute, has semi-long dirty blond hair and beautiful blue eyes oh, and very athletic as he is also part of a swimming team. Many girls dream to go out with him, but he rather focuses on his school, part-time job, and hanging on with his pals.  <br />
<br />
(Tim) Gee Ernie, we cannot just ignore him even though we are just 10 inches tall now. He is a good kid, he won&#39;t hurt us!<br />
<br />
Tim leaves his hiding place, but Ernie hesitates a little before he finally crawls back out. The adorable kid sees them and cannot believe it. He first thinks it&#39;s some kind of toys, maybe animatronics. But they walked toward him to say:<br />
<br />
(Ernie) Sorry Kevin, we forgot about the video camera thing, please don&#39;t be alarmed by our size, it&#39;s a little experiment we tried to see how it is to be at a doll size. About the GoPro, just help yourself, it&#39;s inside the upper right drawer of my computer desk in my home office. You know where it is, right? <br />
<br />
The poor boy was a little petrified, unsettled by that vision of those two grown-ups who voluntarily reduced their size.  Not saying a word, he went to the office and found the video camera with its accessories, he then shoved it inside his back-sac.  Back in the living room, he wanted to know more about the shrinking experiment. He put a knee down to see those two men closer and talk to them.<br />
<br />
(Kevin) I do not understand why you wished to be tiny guys. You are now weaker and more vulnerable. Somebody could take advantage of you. <br />
<br />
(Tim) Yeah, we are aware of that, it&#39;s why we tried it first at home. But we are both fascinated by shrinking, growing, giant stuff for so long.  It is so exhilarating to be in the adventure or survive among giants.  But tell us, Kevin, are you not curious to know how it feels to hold real living action figures, sized men? So let&#39;s play a game if you have some spare time. We will run in all directions and you will try to catch us to play with us.<br />
<br />
The handsome preteen giggled and played the game. Ernie and Tim ran away as fast they could, trying to find shelter under the couch, but were stopped by Kevin&#39;s foot who was enjoying himself a lot. At a moment, Tim, as he tried to run in another direction, stumbled on a pen that was on the floor.  In no time, Kevin grabbed him and did a little triumph dance.<br />
<br />
(Tim) Help, help, I&#39;ve been caught! « he said giggling and squirming a little.» <br />
<br />
Ernie ran toward Kevin&#39;s feet, and looking up at him he yelled. &quot;Hey leave him alone, or else!&quot; Squatting, Kevin grabbed the other tiny man with his free hand.<br />
<br />
(Kevin) I&#39;ve got you both, you are mine now!<br />
<br />
The boy loved the sensation to hold those two men who were almost naked beside them still wearing their underwear. As those guys were such freaks for willingly wanting to be tiny, he decides to give them what they wished for.  He went to where he put his back sac, sat on the floor, and squeezed the two tiny men between his thighs as he was opening the bag.  The two living toys began to think it was not a so good idea after all to play that game with the boy. But, still, they has been gently shoved inside and saw it being closed. It was dark and smelled like chocolate candy bars. They felt lifted and guessed the boy has put the sac on his back and left. It was a bit of shaking all the way back to Kevin&#39;s place. <br />
<br />
Finally, they felt the boy was walking slower, he stopped, and then they heard a door being unlocked.  They found out has been carried to the second floor from the typical sensation of someone climbing the stairs. Then they felt a bit dizzy when Kevin put off the back sac from his back a little too fast to put it on a hard surface. Suddenly the light flooded the interior. They have been blinded as their eyes needed time to adjust.  Without any warning, the boy grabbed Tim first, he laid him on his back on his desk surface, spread his tiny legs wide, and used some scotch tape to restrain them, the same thing for his arms and waist.<br />
<br />
(Tim) No please Kevin, I&#39;m not a lab rat!<br />
<br />
But he was really enjoying being treated like that, it was his fantasy. He witness Kevin grabbing Ernie he held in his left fist. With his free hands, he grabbed the tiny left leg between his thumb and index finger to feel the tiny quadriceps, he did the same with all the limbs. The shrunken man knew he was not in danger and was happy that Kevin loved holding him. <br />
<br />
(Ernie) Oh that is so nice Kevin, I am your toy to play with&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy was not really rough after all. His hands are actually warm and soft. Now and then, to Ernie&#39;s surprise, the boy rubbed his tiny body against his face, Yeah a warm snuggle like he was a pet. After a while, he laid the tiny man beside Tim in the same way. He used a measuring tape to take a record of their size, but he loves stroking those tiny men&#39;s bodies with his fingertips, not forgetting any parts. <br />
<br />
(Kevin) It&#39;s so cool to play with you, you are awesome guys! Do ou think  I could be a nice tiny guys to play with too?  What do you think? I&#39;ve been nice with you to give you want you wished for. What about I carry you back to your place, you grow back and you shrink me? <br />
<br />
(So what do you think they will do if they shrink him)</p>
