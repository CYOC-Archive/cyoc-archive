<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt took stock of everything that Abby just said. Some of it was harmless like loving her cooking, but now he doesn’t want to wear shoes and, as he looks around the gym, feels a need to work out. <br />
Looking around the gym, it wasn’t set up like a normal gym. Instead of the machines being grouped together, there looked like there were stations that guys stayed at that had one of each machine that guy needed for the day. Matt approached the counter to sign in, feeling excited to work out. The man at the counter was about a foot shorter than Matt, but had incredibly broad shoulders. Matt could have sworn this man’s totes was wider than it was tall. He was only wearing a red collar and a matching pair of posers, putting his tattoo-covered chest on display. “‘Sup man.” The guy at the counter said. He looked at a clipboard, clearly struggling to read the names on it. He eventually found Matt’s name and put a check next to it. “Your girlfriend said you should do upper body workouts today, so go to one of those stations. Have fun, bro!” Matt turned to leave, making quick strides to the nearest upper body station. As he walked past, he saw some of the guys were naked, changing into their gym clothes right there at the station. Matt supposed that since gyms were only for men, there was nothing wrong with it. <br />
Matt finally reached an open upper body station and almost tore his clothes off, his excitement to work out (as created by Abby) only increasing as he got closer. He opened the gym bag to see what Abby had packed him for his workout and found a black jockstrap, body oil, and a pair of worn gloves. He quickly put on the jockstrap and gloves and sat himself down at the bench press machine. Without hesitation, he grabbed the bar and began his first set.<br />
He felt the pain of the workout. But more than that, the pleasure of it was overwhelming. The pain of straining his muscles burned, but that burn felt so good that Matt craved more. Between each set, he’s add 5 lbs to the bar, feeling pleasure as the burn increased. Matt eventually looked at the clock and didn’t realize two hours had gone by since he started. He got up, figuring he should switch machines every now and then. As he walked to the next machine, he looked at himself in the mirror. He was dripping with sweat, so much that i’m the lights of the gym, he almost looked like his skin was glowing, even underneath the tick coating of soaked hair. He also wore the biggest smile he had ever seen in his face. You could easily tell he was enjoying himself. He turned to the next machine and saw another guy staring at him, with his mouth open.<br />
This guy was taller that Matt, standing almost 8’ tall. A Japanese man, with his hair tied up in a bun. He was clean shaven, and had no body hair. Also unlike most other guys, who looked like they had thick muscular bodies with some fat to fill themselves out, this man had almost no body fat, putting his 10-pack abs and thick pecs on full display. On his chest was a Japanese kanji character, and on his lower stomach was another. He also had a character on the back of each of his hands. He was wearing a brown cotton loincloth, which was too short to fully hide his massive dick. <br />
Matt was annoyed by the interruption. “Can I help you?” The man closed his mouth, trying to regain his composure. “Matt, is that you?” He said, with a slight Japanese accent. “Yeah? Do I know you?” <br />
It’s me, Ben Hamada! Are you… you know, did you just get here?” <br />
Ben was one of Matt’s friends from his world. They were good buddies, frequently going to bars together for drinks. Matt usually would try to wingman for Ben too, who was still single. It usually didn’t turn out well, since Ben was gay and trying to wingman for him sometimes looked like they were dating. “Ben? Wait, do you mean you’re not normally… you know, that?” Matt felt unsure what to say, in case he was wrong.<br />
“If you mean tall, tatted, insanely hot, and surrounded by my definition of the world’s hottest men, then yeah, that’s not normal.” They we’re both relieved to discover that they were not alone any more. Matt’s eyes darted between Ben and the bicep curl machine. “Hey do you mind if I work out while we talk? I kinda need to…” Ben looked confused but agreed.<br />
Ben recounted his day so far as Matt grunted from the workout. He woke up, just as startled as Matt was, but started his day off masturbating to himself in the mirror. Unlike Matt, this was Ben’s ideal self. As he was coming down from the high of it all, his sister barged in and yelled at him to get dressed and go to the gym, since he was late. As ordered by his sister,  he put on the closest piece of clothing, the loincloth, and sprinted all the way to the gym without breaking a sweat. Apparently he was scheduled for an upper body day too, so he had the next station over.<br />
“I don’t get it though, why did I do that? And why were my posters of my favorite porno guys replaced with naked women?” Matt replied between reps. “I’m pretty sure… that everyone here… is straight.” Ben gasped, surprised. Matt then explained everything he learned.<br />
“So that’s why you can’t stop working out, huh? Almost like you’re addicted.” “Of course I’m addicted. This feels… amazing.” <br />
The two were interrupted by an announcement on the speakers. “ATTENTION BROS. WOMEN WILL BE HERE IN A COUPLE MINUTES FOR LUNCH AND SEX. GET READY!!”<br />
Matt felt his stomach fall. “Time for more changes… damn it.”</p>
