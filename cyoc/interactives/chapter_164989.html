<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A towel wrapped tightly around his torso, another around his head, Edgar sat on his bed and stared at the Amulet of Zulo. Thinking about what he&#39;d done, what he had convinced Abby to do, he wondered if he should allow the changes that were happening to continue, &quot;If there are any more,&quot; he thought, or to try and use the necklace to revert himself back. Shifting in place, he went over his plan and how it hadn&#39;t played out as he had thought it would, as his transformation didn&#39;t seem to be instantaneous, but rather a slow one.<br />
<br />
A twinge of doubt crept over him and for a moment, he questioned his plan. Having never wanted to be a girl, he let his mind wander over his plans for revenge a bit longer before he sighed, &quot;Figure it out in the morning,&quot; and as he stood, he thought, &quot;Maybe I can discuss it with Abby,&quot; as he removed both towels and about to toss them in the laundry hamper, he stopped.<br />
<br />
Something seemed off and it took him a moment before he realised that he couldn&#39;t remember Abby&#39;s male name. He was sure she had a guy&#39;s name, had had a dude&#39;s name, before they had used the Amulet of Zulo. But trying to remember what it had been, he found himself drawing a blank. Standing naked in his room, holding the necklace in one hand, his towels in the other, Edgar stared down at his naked body, taking in the already feminine changes. Tossing the towels into the laundry basket, he huffed, &quot;I&#39;ll just have to ask her in the morning if she knows what he her male name had been. And if she still wants to continue with the plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
The amulet left on the top of his dresser, he pulled out a pale blue sleeper shirt that had a dark blue stars and moon pattern on it and slipped it on. Climbing in bed, oblivious to the fact that what he was wearing was a women&#39;s sleepshirt, Edgar snuggled deeper under the covers. Lying on his side, he continued to think over what he should do, how the conversation with Abby in the morning should go before falling asleep and whether the plan was still worth it.<br />
<br />
He dreamed he was out with Dakotah and Kira again. As they sat in a club, the two drinking something with alcohol, he drinking a pop, the three of them checking out guys, he had a feeling something was off. But what, he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it. Things shifted and he found himself kissing a guy and certain that something was definitely wrong, all he could focus on was that, for some reason, he was naked. The man run his ruff hands over Edgar&#39;s soft skin, start to tease his his nipples, and Edgar felt the guy kissing him, then heard himself moan in want, in expectation. The dude&#39;s cock already hard, Edgar like how it felt pressed it against him and as he felt himself being laid gently down, he spread his legs. Readying himself for what was to come, wanting it, the man&#39;s hand wrapped around his waist, he gasped when he felt the tip of the guy&#39;s cock rubbing pleasantly against the area between his legs, then tickling a specific spot. And as he felt it tease tantalisingly by dipping into an area he was confused as to whether he had or not, then pull out, Edgar felt himself grasp the man&#39;s shoulders. Pulling him closer, he moaned in rapture when he felt the erect dick slide into his vagina, sending waves of ecstasy wash over him.<br />
<br />
With a start Edgar&#39;s eyes snapped open and he sat up. Gasping, looking around his room, alarmed by what he had been dreaming, he found it disturbing how sensitive his erect nipples felt as the soft sleepshirt brushed against them, the moist feeling he felt between his legs, as well as the slight warmth that his mind connected with a physical, ache, a need. Trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with him, it came as a shock to him when he realised he was aroused, but that his dick was still limp. Attempting to slide out of bed, he gasped when the sleepshirt he was wearing made it worse and instead rolling over, he quickly climbed out of bed and shucked off the garment he had on.<br />
<br />
Naked, the cool morning air felt good against his soft skin, he stared down at his penis and testicles. Waiting for the alien, yet somehow familiar, sensation of female arousal to pass, Edgar something looked off about his cock and balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides that they look smaller,&quot; he thought, and it took him a moment before it came to him that he had a sack, but it was empty.<br />
<br />
Alarmed by this, he reached down and touched the fleshy bit beneath his cock. Wondering what had happened to his testicles, he pulled his hand, which he noted was like his feet and hadn&#39;t changed yet, away when he found that not only was the touching making how he was feeling worse, but that he had slowly begun to slip his fingers between his legs. Close to running, he strode across his room, yanked the door open and making his way to Abby&#39;s room, he pushed open the door, calling out, &quot;Hey, Abby. You up? We really need to talk about something,&quot; but stopped when he found the room was as empty as it had been the night before. Staring at the made bed, Edgar wondered where the girl was a moment before turning away and leaving.<br />
<br />
The sensation of arousal starting to leave him, he breathed a sigh in relief, though he found it disturbing how sensitive his erect nipples still felt. Heading for the bathroom, he began to run the shower, figuring it would help calm him.<br />
<br />
Afterward, he once again stood in front of the bathroom mirror and stared at his reflection. In addition to the way his body looked, Edgar noted that his nipples, which were still erect and sensitive, and the surrounding area was more pronounced. His cock, he noted, was a small, limp, white thing that looked pitiful resting against his empty nut sack. Holding up his hands, he flexed them and wondered why they and his feet still hadn&#39;t changed yet. Lowering them and looking at his face, which had the barest hint of a feminine tinge to it, he sighed and ran a hand through his hair, which was almost down to his shoulders and had a red tinge to it. Sniffing, smelling the body wash he had used, absently reaching for a brush on the sink, he began to tease his hair into something that looked cute, yet professional.<br />
<br />
His thoughts drifted to Abby and as he continued to work at his hair, Edgar found that more than ever he needed to talk to the other girl. Wanting to know if what he was experiencing, what was happening to him, the other girl was also going through, he sighed, &quot;But it will have to wait until after work,&quot; and dropping the brush back on the sink, he headed back to his room.<br />
<br />
There, he took from his dresser a pair of panties, a bra. Starting to put on the bra, he stopped when it came to him what he had taken from the dresser. Looking at the sleepshirt, still on the bed where he dropped it, he began opening and closing the drawers on his dresser, discovering that his socks, underwear and pyjamas had been replaced with items a woman would wear, whilst bras and nylons had also been added to the drawer that had his underwear and socks. Staring at the bra he was holding, a white thing with lace running along the top of the cups, somehow knowing it was size 36C, he looked down at his chest, took in the erect, sensitive nipples, and found it odd how normal it seemed that he would wear such an thing. Putting it on with ease, he slipped on the panties, his limp cock ending up tucked back as he did, giving his groin a flat look. Looking at the Amulet of Zulo, needing more than ever to talk with Abby about what was happening and whether it was even worth going through with the plan, which he found didn&#39;t really matter any more, he turned away and marched across his room.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, he located his work schedule. Seeing he worked the nine to five shift today, he turned and headed back to his room to finish getting ready for work, noting as he did that he had at least an hour and half before he had to get there. And as he pulled on a pair of slacks and his work shirt, he thought, &quot;Soon as I am done with work, I need to find Abby and talk with her.&quot;</p>
