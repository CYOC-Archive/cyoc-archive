<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you two are walking to get some cotton candy it starts raining heavily, Awww, its raining! Karen takes of her leather jacket and holds it over their heads, you both run out of the carnival and head home, since karens place is closer you both decide to go there. <br />
Karen locks up the door and you walk inside, she slowly pats yout butt as you walk inside, you blush slightly and look around, you&#39;ve been here alot before but for some reason it looks all different now, it feels bigger.<br />
Are you lost cutie ? N-no no, i just thought you had moved some stuff...moved some stuff ? when ? you slept over here and we left for the carnival togheter are you sure you&#39;re okay ? I think so...maybe i just need some sleep, its getting kinda late, Yeah i gues karen looks at the clock, its already 21.00 i guess we can go to bed early today. <br />
Karen holds your hand and leads you to the bedroom, you notice an oversized t-shirt lying on the bed, i washed your favourite jammies, You smile at karen, she is really nice to you...is it because she is trying to be responsible to impress you ? if so, its working.<br />
You brush your theeth and puts on the shirt, you lie down in the bed, Karen smiles and snuggles up against you and kisses your lips, want to sleep or cuddle ? you yawn, Karen giggle and kisses your lips, Good night Ashley, love you, Love you Karen.<br />
That night did not go well, the facct you were a girl were still bugging you but all these feelings aswell, your breasts and your womanhood, everytime you moved your legs you could feel it, you let out a soft moan, around the middle of the night you sleepily got out of the bed and head to the bathroom to pee, you didnt really think much of it but it definately felt...something, you went back to the bed and promptly fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The next day you wake up in an empty bed, you remove your blankets and sure enough, still a girl, you had a small hope it was just a dream but nope, you smell something....bacon ? you can hear sizzling, you get out of the bed and heads downstairs.<br />
oh, Good morning Sweetheart did i wake you ? you shake your head, No no...im fine, yawns and walks over to her, she leans down a tin bit and kisses your lips, you gently kiss her back, we have to go to the carnival today Karen...<br />
Karen looks at me, Ashley dear...the carnival has closed, it was their last day yesterday. <br />
<br />
I...S..you stutter and look down at the floor, Are you okay Ashley ? Whats wrong cutie ? she turns of the stove and holds around Ashley comforting her, But but...i...i cant...You cant what Ashley ? its okay, we can do something else okay ? you dont have to win that cute teddy bear you wanted to win for me, its okay dear okay ? It&#39;s...it&#39;s not that it&#39;s just...what am i going to do...do you love me karen ? of course i love you Ashley, you&#39;re my girlfriend! i super love you. <br />
e<br />
Ashley sits down on the sofa and pretty much tells karen what happened yesterday the carnival, she is not quite beliving her but doubting her now wont probably do her any good.<br />
So Ashley dear, you were my 18 year old boyfriend but got turned into a teenage girl by the mirror house at the carnival ? Ashley nods slowly, i promise! its true<br />
Karen just sighs, Ashley dear, thats just so hard to belive and why would i even date a guy in the first place ? im a lesbian... to be honest i think you just had a real vivid dream that you thought was real and even if it was real, so what ? youre a girl, so what ? its not the end, and you got me and youre freaking adorable! you&#39;re alot better of like this anyway.<br />
<br />
Ashley looks at her,maybe...maybe i did dream it ? but it  felt so real...Ashley wipes away her tears and looks at Karen, Karen sits down next to her and strokes her hair, its okay dear, it was just a bad dream, im sure you&#39;re my adorable girl Ashley.<br />
Ashley knowing she cant convicnce Karen just nods, yeah, im sure it was a bad dream dear, she gets up from the sofa and back to the stove and starts cooking up her breakfast, Want egg and bacon dear ? Y-yes please.<br />
<br />
They sit down and eat their breakfast, So Karen ? what do you like best about me ? Karen giggles and almost chokes on her food, she drinks a glass of water and looks at Ashley, i love everything about you Ashley, you&#39;re adorable! i love everything about you. <br />
<br />
Ashley blushes, these compliments actually feels really nice...their former relationship was kinda on the rock so seeing it like this is a nice change Ashley thinks as she takes a pice of her eggs.<br />
<br />
Ashley looks at karen and finish up her food, want me to clean up ? Karen looks at her, that would be great Ash, starts picking up the plates and puts them in the dishwasher, you wash your hands in the sink and walk up back to the bedroom. <br />
<br />
She walks inside and looks around in the drawers, looking trough it she find&#39;sd a rather cute skirt and a white top with the work Girlpower in bright purple writing, She decides to put them on and walk to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Karen is already inside undressing, oh hey sexy, want to take a shower with me ? A shower with Karen, you look at her as she undresses you can feel something inside you, a pressing feeling in your nether regions you look up at Karen who are slowly walks towards you butt-naked, Whats wrong dear ? you&#39;re not still thinking about that dream are you ? No, i just got to something on my mind but...i&#39;ll join you, hesitantly undresses and takes of her bra and panties.<br />
<br />
Karen looks at you, you blush as you can see her eyes inspecting you, she walks over and kisses your lips lovingly and strokes your back, Love you Ashley. They walk in the shower togheter, you had never done anything like this Before, you look at karen and snuggles into her. Karen strokes her back, they step out of the shower and dry themselves up.<br />
<br />
Its Early evening, Ashley and Karen are in their bed, Ashley is looking at her phone and Karen is reading some book, Looking trough the pictures on the phone it shows ashley and karen from before, they started dating when Ashley was 12 and Karen was 15, She puts the phone down on the nighttable and looks over at karen, Karen puts down the book and looks at her, whats wrong cutie ? feeling sick ? sad ? i Shake my head, im fine just feeling a bit weird, its like...something is pressing inside me, Karen looks at me confused she rolls over to my side of the bed and pins me down to the bed. <br />
Something pressing inside you ? I nod slowly, her smile then turns into a large grin as she gently moves her had down my body and gently down my panties, i start breating heavily and looks at karen, what are you doing dear ? we have done this a million times, just relax okay ? she starts stroking my breasts with her hand and my womanhood with her other, i moan loudly, each touch sends ripples trough my body, i can feel my legs turning weak, luckily im not standing.<br />
she keeps stroking me softly and gently making sure im getting the best experience, i can feel something inside it gets...my whole body shakes and i moan loudly as i can feel something slowly dripping out of my womanhood, i keep moanining loudly and panting heavily as Karen looks at me and smiles, Congratulations dear, you just came first time this week.<br />
<br />
The next few year passes as they tend to do, I&#39;m now 36 years old, im a Hairdresser actually, Karen said i should pursue it so i did...i think im pretty good aswell i mean, people say i am but i dont know...i always feel like im missing something, maybe its just me. I look at my wedding ring, im thinking about karen alot recently...she&#39;s been on a buisness trip but she is coming home today, im so excited! its only been one week but i mean, still thats a long time without your wifey...<br />
Finally! the work day is over, i hurry and pack my stuff, grab my coat and purse and walk as fast as i can to the car, these heels are not for running but i cant help it. I jump in my car and drive home only to find the door already open, i walk inside and see her, standing in the living  room looking, she spots me and i look at her deeply in the eyes, its as if time stands still, i walk over to her and wrap my arms around her, she does the same to me as i kisses her deeply and passionately, i missed you so much Karen wifey! i missed you to Dear.<br />
I took the time and prepared some nice dinner for her so we sit down and have ourselves a nice dinner with some good wine, we finish up our food as she holds my hand, that deep lustfull look in her eye as she leads me upstairs, i lie down in the bed and starts undressing as she does the same, she gently lie her naked body down on mine i kiss her lips as she moves her head further down and starts licking my womanhood, we spent what must have been hours making love since im exhausted when she stops, i look over at and she looks back at me, I love you Karen, I love you Ashley my dear wife.</p>
