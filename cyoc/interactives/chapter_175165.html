<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I HATED wrestling. There was nothing that I wanted to do less than play sports with a bunch of smelly boys that hated me for my sexuality. <br />
<br />
So, naturally, I joined the team for my junior year of high school. <br />
<br />
You’re probably thinking about what kind of drugs I’m on, and honestly I don’t blame you. Why the hell would I make that decision? <br />
<br />
The answer: Coach Peterson. <br />
<br />
I had never seen a more attractive looking man in my entire life. His chiseled jawline was outlined by well-kept facial hair, his pecs bulged out of his tight shirts, and there was never a time that his evidently massive cock was pressing against his pants. <br />
<br />
I was willing to suffer through wrestling just to be near him. <br />
<br />
I was extremely nervous for the first day of practice. I had no idea how to wrestle and was worried that Coach Peterson would give me a boner that I couldn’t hide. <br />
<br />
The day went well though. We started out with some pretty easy basics and then conditioned for the rest of practice. I tried to get glimpses of Coach whenever I could but never long enough that he would make me hard. <br />
<br />
During one exercise we did while Coach had left for a moment, a kid named Jeremy Hennings came up to me and shoved me to the ground. “Go back to theater practice, fag,” he yelled in my face. <br />
<br />
I got back up and brushed it off. I was expecting this to happen. It was just like any other day. Still, there was a part of me that wanted to shove him back, but I knew I couldn’t get in trouble if I wanted to say on the team. <br />
<br />
At the end of the practice we trudged to the locker rooms and changed out of our sweaty clothes. We were then joined by Coach Peterson. <br />
<br />
“Great first practice today boys,” Peterson said. “I’m excited to see what you accomplish this season. We definitely have some great leadership and also a few newbies that have joined this year that together will make for a great team. See you all tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Then, to my horror, Coach walked right up to me. I tried not to stare at his nipples poking out of his thin shirt and the way his pants hugged his butt extremely tight. <br />
<br />
“Come speak to me in my office please, Samuel,” he said. I was about to be alone in a room with Coach Peterson. <br />
<br />
I followed him into a small room that he called his “office.” It consisted of a desk, two chairs on either side, some inspirational sports pictures, and not much else. A small window looked out into the locker room. <br />
<br />
Peterson closed the door behind us and closed the blinds on the window, and we each sat down in a chair. “I don’t want you to think you’re in trouble,” Coach said. “I just wanted to ask you a couple questions.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” I replied meekly. I was already really hard just from looking at the enormous biceps that threatened to rip through Coach’s t-shirt sleeves. <br />
<br />
“As a new member of the team,” Coach said, “I want to know what your goals are for the season.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, well . . . um I really just want to, uh, get better at wrestling and hopefully, um, make some new friends.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, of course,” he replied. “Wrestling is a great way to meet new people.” <br />
<br />
At this point he got up from his desk to walk around. I tried to resist, but my eyes immediately focused on his crotch. He either had a boner or his cock was just so big that it looked like he did. I could even see the outline of his balls. <br />
<br />
“What can I do to help you achieve those goals?” Peterson asked.<br />
<br />
I tried to think of an answer but my dick was so hard that it was distracting me and sending me waves of pleasure. How was I supposed to survive the whole season if I can barely even talk to him? “Um . . . I guess as long as I can always get your ass, uh, assistance whenever I, um, need your help with something.” <br />
<br />
“Okay, yes, of course,” he replied. “Well that’s all I really need to know.” I could tell he knew that I was uncomfortable. “I’ll see you for practice tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Um, yeah,” I replied. “See ya tomorrow.” I got up and out of the office as fast as I could with my dick very  visibly pressing against my shorts. I walked out of the locker room and went to get my backpack. I could’t stop thinking about Coach’s hairy arms and his massive dick. <br />
<br />
I was just about to leave when I realized that I had left my car keys in the locker room. “Damn it,” I whispered under my breath. <br />
<br />
I made my way back up to the locker room. I stuck my head around the corner. Coach was still in his office; however, the blinds were up, and I could see inside. <br />
<br />
I almost dropped my textbooks when I saw what Coach was doing. He was sitting in one of the chairs completely naked with his phone in his left hand, and he was jerking off his enormous cock. <br />
<br />
I couldn’t believe it. I wanted to run away but I had to get my keys. I set my stuff down and got down onto my hands and knees. I crawled along the floor of the locker room and made my way to the other side. When I got beneath the window I stopped and had an idea.<br />
<br />
This was the reason I joined the wrestling team right? I got my phone out of my pocket and raised it up so that just the camera was peeking above the window sill. <br />
<br />
I started recording. <br />
<br />
This entire time my penis was rock hard. I could hear his loud breathing and occasional moaning and I could barely stop myself from jerking off with him. <br />
<br />
Then all of a sudden the porn video he was watching stopped. I froze with fear. Had he seen my phone? I started crawling again and quickly hid in the showers.<br />
<br />
Silence. <br />
<br />
More silence. <br />
<br />
Then I heard the turning of a door handle and the creaking sound of the door opening. <br />
<br />
I pressed myself against the far wall of the showers where it was dark. I still had a massive boner that I couldn’t seem to get rid of. <br />
<br />
All of sudden there was footsteps, slow ones but each one a little louder than the last. Peterson was coming my way. There was nothing I could do.<br />
<br />
The footsteps grew louder and louder until finally Coach Peterson stepped into the locker room showers, wearing nothing but his socks. <br />
<br />
My dick throbbed with pleasure. <br />
<br />
His face was red from jerking off. His massive pecs and furry biceps throbbed from adrenaline, and his beautiful six pack abs teased me right below. <br />
<br />
A trail of hair led from his pecs down the middle of his abs and landed in a bush of pubes. And right below those pubes: the biggest cock I had ever seen, with massive, hairy balls dangling below. <br />
<br />
To top it all of, his right hand was covered in lube. <br />
<br />
I tried to speak, but no sound came out. What was I supposed to say anyway? Luckily, he spoke first. <br />
<br />
“You could get into a lot of trouble for what you just did.” <br />
<br />
“Yes, sir,” I managed to get out. <br />
<br />
“I should report this to the principal right now,” Coach said, “but Samuel I know you’re a good kid. Was this a dare or something? Tell me who put you up to this.”<br />
<br />
“Ummmm . . .” I couldn’t take my eyes of his massive swinging cock. “I really don’t, uh, want to get anyone in trouble.”<br />
<br />
“Come with me,” he said.<br />
<br />
I followed him back into his office. Peterson pulled on a pair of white briefs that did nothing to hide his enormous penis. “I want to watch you delete that video,” he said.<br />
<br />
Coach pulled on a shirt, but of course it was a tight one that made his giant, hairy pecs look even bigger. Finally, he put on some jeans that made his butt look massive and still did nothing to hide his cock. “Now,” he said.<br />
<br />
I walked out of the office and grabbed my phone, still trying to hide my boner. I showed him my phone as I deleted the video. <br />
<br />
“Good,” Peterson said. “Now please tell me who put you up to this.”<br />
<br />
I thought back to earlier. “Jeremy Hennings, sir.” <br />
<br />
“Thank you,” he replied. “Now get home. Wrestlers need their sleep.” <br />
<br />
“Yes, sir.” I grabbed my keys and got out of the locker room as fast as I could. Once I got to my car I pulled my pants down and finally was able to jerk off. <br />
<br />
I found the video in my recently deleted and recovered it. Every detail of Coach’s hot, muscular body was in frame, and I came faster than I ever have before, shooting jizz all over my steering wheel.</p>
