<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kent looked at an astonished Peter – “How can I be growing like this?”<br />
<br />
“Simply, Ty is helping you out, he always like to do that from distance…”<br />
<br />
“So he’s making me grow taller? But I’m huge! I’m taller than most NBA players!” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I know that, but if I know my cousin, and I do know him pretty well…”<br />
<br />
Kent drops his jaw as he feels his body growing even taller! “This is weird!”<br />
<br />
“Two can play that game Ty!” Peter said as he closed his eyes adding his powers to Ty’s efforts, causing Kent to grow even taller – surpassing the eight feet in height.<br />
<br />
“This is humanly impossible!” Kent smiled “and I’ like that!” <br />
<br />
When Kent reached 9’8” tall they stopped – the kid looked really weird, his hands and feet were huge, fortunately, Peter and Ty wished for his clothing to grow with him.<br />
<br />
“How’s the weather up there stretch?” Peter grinned<br />
<br />
“Amazing!” Kent replied in a big grin<br />
<br />
“Well, you’re 9’8” tall, weighing 425 pounds, but you look like a piece of spaghetti, no offense!” Peter laughed out loud, but don’t worry, I know Ty and Allen are ready to change that…”<br />
<br />
“What you mean?”<br />
<br />
“Kent, as in Clark Kent” Peter smiles – “You are really into comic books right ?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I read the, I draw my own characters, I am so fascinated by the comic book world!”<br />
<br />
Peter closed his eyes contacting Ty and Allen for one second and then he looked at his tall friend.<br />
<br />
“Ty says you’re his new kid brother, and well, in our family we like our kid brothers to be really different…”<br />
<br />
“More than I already am?” Kent smiled – “This is impossible!”<br />
<br />
“Not for us, we’re gonna make you our super-hero!” Peter grinned.<br />
<br />
“Super Hero? Like Superman?”<br />
<br />
“oh no! He’s too short and too weak! WE need something better!”<br />
<br />
“WE?”<br />
<br />
“Yep, Ty, Allen and myself – We’re giving you a super dose!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, what are you guys dooooooooooooooooooooooing!” Kent felt his body shaking<br />
<br />
He was surrounded by a strong blue light – “Kent Collins, for your bravery and noble heart, I give you the POWER beyond POWER” he heard Peter’s voice on his mind.<br />
<br />
“Shall you become the biggest and most powerful superhero ever created!” Allen’s voice gathered.<br />
<br />
“all the powers you shall have!” Peter completed<br />
<br />
“no weaknesses you will burden” Ty said joining the mantra.<br />
<br />
“Your body will have the size of your heart!”<br />
<br />
“Your muscles will have the strength of your faith”<br />
“Your power will grow as your good deeds are proved!”<br />
<br />
“Always improving”<br />
<br />
“Forever increasing!”<br />
<br />
“You’ll be the Hero all humans need! Helping the weak and the needed! You shall never be defeated in a battle!”<br />
<br />
“Your body will keep growing stronger and more powerful, and so will your mind and heart”<br />
<br />
“WE give you the power Kent – be loyal and trustful as you’ve always been!”<br />
<br />
“Villains from all the world, be aware! You’ll shall face THE PALADIN!”<br />
<br />
These words flooded Kent’s mind with hope and courage, he suddenly opened his eyes, and saw a different view, they weren’t on the school gym anymore.<br />
<br />
“WHERE ARE WE?” Kent noticed this wasn’t his voice – this was a deep powerful tone, he looked at Peter, and saw Ty and Allen appeared from nowhere<br />
<br />
“hey don’t worry, Paladin!” Ty grinned. Kent and Peter also smiled at a stupefied Kent.<br />
<br />
“WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS DONE TO ME? AND WHY ARE YOU SO DAMN SMALL?”<br />
<br />
“Oh we are not small, you are HUGE!” Allen laughed out loud.<br />
<br />
Peter produced a giant mirror for their friend – Kent almost fainted.<br />
<br />
He saw a true MUSCLE TITAN – 25’tall his tanned massive skin, huge muscles, so huge they made his head look really small, his chest, biceps and abdomen were simply outstanding. He saw the veins and the bulging muscles – so big and huge. His hair was light brown but much longer, floating against the soft breeze, the heavy locks were crowned by a golden headband making him look even more handsome, his square and jaw were perfect, his nose flawless, his eyes were green and really impressive, he was dressed in some kind of spandex white uniform, with no sleeves, golden giant boots with matching arm bands a huge “P” on his massive super wide chest.<br />
<br />
“THIS CAN’T BE POSSIBLE!” Kent still looked at himself.<br />
<br />
“Nothing is impossible for those guys!” Allen said pointing at Ty and Peter.<br />
<br />
“So I became a giant?” Kent asked trying to control his new voice tone.<br />
<br />
“Oh well, you’re a giant, but you can shrink to a more manageable size or grow even bigger, you have the POWER!”<br />
<br />
“POWER TO GROW?”<br />
<br />
“No, silly – POWER!”<br />
<br />
“To do anything you want! Any super hero ability you can think of, you already have!” Ty smiled.<br />
<br />
“You can fly, you can fire rays with your eyes, you can run faster than time, you are invulnerable” Peter explained.<br />
<br />
“You also can use your mind to enhance your own powers, you can read people’s minds, you can control the weather, you can change yourself into anything you want…”<br />
<br />
“BUT THAT’S WHAT YOU GUYS DO RIGHT?”<br />
<br />
“Kind of, but the point is,  YOU are now THE PALADIN”<br />
<br />
“You’ll live the life of a super hero!”<br />
<br />
“But you have no weak spots, you’re indestructible, your heart is pure, and you shall bring some glory to this world!”<br />
<br />
“you mean I’ll fly around and rescue people, save them from accidents?”<br />
<br />
“Sure!” <br />
<br />
“but how about my life?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, all super heroes need their secret identity, and you still have yours, only we know you’re Kent, and you can change yourself into Kent!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if I want to become that scrawny kid again…”<br />
<br />
“don’t worry, we took care of everything!” Peter winked – “Try changing back to Kent!”<br />
<br />
The Paladin nodded, as he blinked his eyes, he was back into Kent’s body – well the NEW Kent’s body – because he was a 6’8” 370 pounds massive muscular teen, with bulging veins and uncanny muscles – his hair was back the way it had always been, and he wore his old glasses, well at least they were new glasses, really modern and beautiful, his clothing was also very clean, hip and styled.<br />
<br />
“Guys, you changed me?”<br />
<br />
“You better believe it Kent, no one in the school will ever remember you uses to be the way you were, you’re the biggest on our school, super muscular and powerful, and even your brain got brighter, you’re the dream of any comic book creator!”<br />
<br />
Kent had tears on his eyes – he grabbed the three guys in a massive hug, gently squeezing them with his omni strength – “Kent, Kent! You’re crushing us!” Peter gently alerted him, and Kent let go the hug – “I’m sorry I guess I don’t know my own strength!” Kent blushed.<br />
<br />
“Well you better start controlling yourself, because you’re stronger than anything you can think of, astronomically strong!”<br />
<br />
“What you mean Ty?”<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s say if you wanted, you could take Earth to take a walk on the galaxy so strong your muscles are!” Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
Kent gulped.<br />
<br />
Peter tapped his back – “Don’t worry, all this power came to the right man, or teen, hehe!”<br />
<br />
“My 14 year old little brother is the World’s Greatest Hero!” Ty said hugging Kent this time.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the family, cousin!” Peter hugged him also.<br />
<br />
“thanks guys, but I gotta go now, I hear screams on the other side of the city!” Kent said quickly changing back into PALADIN, not into his whole 25’ size, but a 9’tall behemoth who could take any problem which appears, and he flew away into the blue sky.<br />
<br />
“What are we waiting for? Let’s see how our super hero acts!” Ty grinned quickly changing them into birds so they could see everything without drawing the attention from Kent’s deeds…<br />
<br />
And so they left in the search of new adventures for THE PALADIN!<br />
