<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark had planned for the next step for his brother, his friends and Ben as his pets already. With their hands and feet dealt with, and their tails in position, the next step would be their heads. Because of his sadistic streak, Mark would again use clothes for this, but this time, it would be his own. He would use his old masturbation sock as the sample, and copy it onto a couple of old socks that he should have trashed already. Grinning evilly after picking six old socks with a few holes each, he easily found the “data” of his socks, and as planned, copied the crusty cum stains over the old ones. With another thought of being cruel, he also added the sweaty part of the socks he wore right now, slightly increasing the smell and taste it would have from a few hours to three days, and that only the wearer would notice either smell. It would imprint him as their owner on them.<br />
Next, Mark programmed each sock to a target, each gaining a small letter for who would get it, as well as the animal it would represent. The changes would start the moment the “wearer” had it near enough to his face and took a sniff on them. It would affect primary their mouth and nose, but the cloth would also change the rest of the face to fit the animal.<br />
With a satisfied smirk, Mark had saved the changes and took the socks with him downstairs to give his little pets their new, fitting faces. Right now, Chris, Justin, Dean and Theo were playing, while Ben and Rick were watching, not that Ben would be able to play. A quick look around showed that neither Aidan nor Luke were present, most likely in their rooms.<br />
Because Rick was watching from behind the rest, sitting upside down on the couch, Mark could easily approach him without disturbing the others. Again, grinning evilly, Mark took the sock marked by an “R” and a “M” and without stopping, pressed its opening onto Rick´s nose.<br />
Rick hadn´t reacted to Mark approaching, nor to the sock he had in hand. He was surprised and shocked getting said sock pressed to his nose, taking a whiff of it by breathing, normally through his nose. His eyes widened in reaction to that, but any protest was stopped as the changes of the sock started, shortly silencing him.<br />
Before Mark´s eyes the sock melted into Rick´s face, its substance covering the skin completely, with the only holes being his eyes. As a monkey has no snout or muzzle, Rick´s face remained mostly in form. His nose widened, and his mouth slightly grew out for a centimeter or two. His ears become rounder, and over all, the skin got darker and more leathery, like his changed hands and feet. His hair got a bit darker brown as well.<br />
Only a few seconds had passed between pressing the sock onto Rick´s face and finishing the changes, but as Rick blinked, he forgot the sock ever being there. Only the smell and taste remained changed to him. Looking at Mark in confusion, but not asking why he was there.<br />
Mark, knowing what was now on Rick´s mind, asked: “Rick, what´s that smell?” He had to hide his grin, as only Rick could smell “his” stinking face.<br />
Rick was forced to answer truthfully: “I don´t know. It just appea…” Mark clapped into that, filling the hole quickly with: “It´s always there, because it´s your smell, but nobody ever noticed beside you. It reminds you of your master and owner, but only subconsciously.” Mark let that sink in and just as Rick blinked, showing he accepted his answer as right, before asking: “Rick, what happened to your face?”<br />
Rick had accepted that annoying smell as his own, knowing now it never left him, as that question came in. His hands went up touching it as he answered: “Huh? My face?” As he touches it, he continued: “I don´t kno….” Again, Mark stopped the answer before filling in: “Don´t worry, everything is as it was. I wanted to confuse you, Rick. Your face is normal as it is, my silly little monkey.”<br />
Rick blinked and nodded. “Yeah, my face is normal, nothing is wrong.” Just as he was to comment on the “confusing him” part, Justin pushed the game controller into his hands. “Your turn, Rick.” before munching on some crumbs on the floor by Rick´s hands. That distracted him enough for Mark to leave Rick alone.<br />
Waiting a few moments for Justin to move back from Rick, Mark this time asked his target: “Hey Justin, how does it smell?” He now was holding the sock labeled with a “J” and a “P” out towards Justin.<br />
Justin, always eager for food, quickly collided his nose into the old sock, thinking off it as food. He took a deep breath out of it, which activated the changes for him.<br />
Like with Rick, Justin´s sock melted into his face, but while Rick as a monkey had no outwards grow, Justin gained a snout. His nose was pulled forward and round, with his mouth being pulled as well. But it was mostly the nose that now filled his face. His ears were pulled a bit up on his head, while becoming more flat and less fixed to it. His skin got a bit rougher and turned a dirty pink color. As for his light blond hair, it got to nearly the same color as his skin, and due his short cut, was nearly invisible.<br />
The slight daze of the change left Justin, now sniffing empty air, grunting louder than before. Still, Mark´s question forced Justin´s mouth, and he answered: “It smells sweaty and dirty, but I don´t know whe…” Mark hid his grin as he clapped that sentence away, answering for Justin to accept: “You smell yourself, Justin, nothing wrong with that. While you don´t really like the smell, it reminds you of your owner.”<br />
Like with Rick, Mark asked Justin about his face, and replaced what he needed: “Your face is normal as it is, nothing to worry about, my little piggy.” Justin nodded at that, soon happily snacking on some chips and crumbs again, until he switched game positions with Theo.<br />
Again, Mark just pushed the right sock, labeled with “T” and “B” onto the nose of his target, and Theo smelled it by accident, or more likely, breathing. Any complains died that second, as his changes started. <br />
Theo´s sock got a stiff part, turning into his new, real beak, covering the area of his nose and mouth, and at least pointing two inches away from his face. The rest of the sock melted onto his skin leaving it white with small feathers covering the sides of his face, replacing his hair, and covering his vanishing ears, leaving only small holes hidden remain.<br />
Blinking, Theo was assaulted by the smell sitting in his new beak, and just as with the others, Mark made him aware that it was his own scent and wouldn´t go away, but make him feel safe and remember his owner.<br />
Like with the other two, Mark asked Theo about his face, and replaced what he needed: “Your face is normal as it is, strong pointy beak and all that. Nothing to worry about, my cute birdie.” Theo nodded at that, before giving Mark a stink-eye for the “cute” comment. He returned to sitting calmly, waiting for his next turn in the game.</p>
