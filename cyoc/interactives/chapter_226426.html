<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bug typed away, trying to describe a garment which would cover a human torso, with an opening on one side, and then drape across the back of a large dog somehow, when he started sweating profusely. He collapsed on the floor twitching and coughing up some strange sticky substance, which just spread further across his body when he tried to wipe it off. The coughing continued as he rolled about the floor, eventually covered in the sticky stuff, head to toe which was hardening fast. Once fully encased, he passed out from the lack of oxygen, but all the while his body was changing profoundly. Disolving almost completely to a sort of organic stew save for his brain, and then reforming, slowly at first, his nerve fibers branching and rearranging. Next organs, muscle, and other tissue, the finally a slick black carapace and sharp claws at the ends of each of his limbs. Stuggling, he finally tore through the strange membranous shell that covered him, pulling himself out onto the floor to rest and stretch his arms, legs and wings. Wait, that wasn&#39;t right.<br />
<br />
Glancing around the room, he found a mirror, and was baffled by his own reflection. Firstly because his vision felt completely off. He was seeing far more of the room at once than he should be, and in a way that felt oddly fractured and pixelated. As if his eyes were covered by some filter, breaking his vision into hundreds of separate images, each with barely any resolution. Still, it was enough to see his new body. Black chitin from head to toe, and far smaller than he had been before. Perhaps barely one foot tall. He was slim, too, especially around the waist, which at it&#39;s narrowest point was barely wider than his finger, practically separating his torso into two egg shaped lumps, the lower part dangling behind him, a vivid yellow counterweight he could freely move in any direction, and a more proper torso, with coarse thick hairs, to which his legs and arms were attached... all four of his arms.<br />
<br />
Each seemed to be short a couple fingers, but he could control all four just fine. His legs felt... springier, and there were some sort of rasps on his thighs that made a rather interesting sound, almost like a violin if he carelessly let them rub together. His face was even more jarring, with two bright blue compound eyes absolutely bulging out from the side of his head, flanked by a mouth he could speak through in a rasping voice but which lacked proper lips. His nose had changed to some sort of tubelike proboscis, which reminded him a bit of a fly&#39;s, perhaps suggesting he could belch up acid from it or something, but he wasn&#39;t super inclined to try. Then of course there were the antenae, sticking out between his absurdly large eyes, and just below the strange mop of red hair he seemed to have. He was sort of able to smell through them, and like the odd new sense he&#39;d given Cerby, they seemed to grant him some strange extra sense, identifying anyone who&#39;d been magically transformed within a fairly impressive range. The multi-torsoed centaurs he&#39;d been reading about honestly didn&#39;t seem too far away, maybe a few miles, easy enough to find if he flew with those new wings.<br />
<br />
Those too the longest for him to really process. Shiny gossimer things, still taking a moment to dry. In theory though he could just flutter them and lift off the ground. All rather fascinating. Thrilled and excited by these strange changes, he opened the nearest window,and flew out into the night.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Cerby was angrily trying to swipe her phone back from Erby, who&#39;d snatched it away while was was putting on the weird jacket she&#39;d spotted in the diner&#39;s lost and found on the way out. Finally she snagged it and looked at what the other had wrote in shock. &quot;Gross! Why would you do all that to someone who was being so helpful!? Look, he hooked me up with this new coat and everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erby retorted that if he really wanted to be helpful he could have split them all back up, or slimmed them down in some way to make it easlier to fit through doors. She also noted how, as she put it, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure anyone way into bugs is way into body horror too. It just always seems to line up that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erus nodded in agreement. &quot;Yeah, might have even appreciated being turned female, forced to lay just huge clutches of eggs everywhere... hey is it too late to add something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Further fighting over the phone ensued as they all followed Cerby&#39;s directional sense, hopefully towards whoever it was that could undo them being such a freak. Eventually, Bug caught up with them, perching on a wall, and giving a slight wave, but trying to stay far enougj away not to catch their collective virus, as Bug made a rather awkward introduction.</p>
