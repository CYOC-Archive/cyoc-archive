<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jensen walked (favoring his bitten leg) to the twin's shriek gambling on leaving Kaylee <br />
again to deal with any unwanted guests. <br />
<br />
Martha for her part merely stood calmly and bowed her heads at the twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master!&quot; The twins chorused pointing their fingers, &quot;WHAT IS THAT-?!&quot;  <br />
<br />
The creature before them was frightening, double the number of arms, tails, breasts, and <br />
heads, and triple the number of eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;That is Martha.&quot; Jensen put a paw on her shoulder, &quot;She is the new governess for the <br />
cubs. She is our permanent pack Omega. Outside of looking after the pups she is to listen <br />
and to obey and submit to all of us no matter how large our numbers might become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; Martha said with both her heads. <br />
<br />
&quot;Martha, this is Fran and Darla, the two of them are the other two adult members of the <br />
pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twins?&quot; The heads said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The twins echoed. &quot;We are. Since becoming part of the pack yesterday that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen continued, &quot;Martha the website we found on the game says we can invoke the <br />
game on up to five people at a time. You currently have the game and it'll pass on to <br />
however you use it on. We'll be briefly going over Bart's ideas on how to do with the staff <br />
depending on which ones chose Transform and which ones chose Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha said, &quot;Won't matter who they were really once they chose transform.&quot; She didn't <br />
feel any emotion at the idea of the staff sharing her fate. <br />
<br />
Jensen cackled, &quot;Exactly right my dear.&quot; He touched her tails and she felt bliss. &quot;Now hurry <br />
along and fetch Bart.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Master. By Bart, you mean Bartholomew?&quot; Her heads turned and asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Both he and Jenny are now the pups in this family, along with Kaylee's former <br />
parents, Kevin and Marcy, they are all siblings. The four of them are your responsibility.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master.&quot; She bowed her heads. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master....&quot; Darla whimpered.<br />
<br />
Fran continued, &quot;Did you have to make her so so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrible?&quot; Martha asked emotionlessly all six of her eyes staring at the twins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The twins said then covered their mouths. <br />
<br />
Jensen said, &quot;She's one of a kind and will be the only one of her kind. I made her quite <br />
unique, don't you agree Martha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master I do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You serve and obey me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Without question or hesitation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is your worth compared with mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely none.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH HOW I've waited for you to say that!&quot; Jensen slapped her on the rear, Martha's head <br />
blushed deeply. <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other and bowed their heads at their Master: They lived to serve <br />
and to serve was to live. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now hurry along.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
Martha obeyed. <br />
<br />
The twins turned her heads never stopping to look at the wavering of her two tails behind <br />
her. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the record, Kaylee considers her a work of art.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The twins simply replied. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
All the pups were fully engrossed in the four way virtual tennis match they were engaged <br />
in, while there was indeed plenty that did and would still need doing (like the removal of <br />
the rest of the doors, change of door frames, disposal of doors, and the selling and <br />
disposal of other items the Big bad Wolf pack would never have any need for again as it <br />
grew larger and larger), they weren't about to -not- have some fun when the had the <br />
chance. The current battle had Bart and Jensen in front position and Marcy and Jenny in <br />
back position, neither getting many swings in as the boys continued to knock the tennis <br />
ball back and forth between them on screen. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's are adult games?&quot; Kevin asked Marcy again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Playing Parcheesi,&quot; Marcy said referring an old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon,  &quot;And playing <br />
the saxophone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Master Bart, the Master has commanded that you come see him in the servant's foyer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart started at the new voice and turned around, he knew that voice from somewhere. He <br />
dropped his controller, letting Kevin score a point breaking the deuce. <br />
<br />
The other pups played for a second more before turning around and dropping their <br />
controllers in similar fashion.<br />
<br />
Bart hadn't know what Master would turn Martha into, but seeing the brown haired silver <br />
she-wolf thing before him completely throw him for  a loop.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-M-Martha?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master Bart, it is I.&quot; The two heads bowed, &quot;I'll be taking over as your governess, you <br />
shall not ignore me in any manner as this authority has been given to me by the Master <br />
himself, do you all understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
All four pups stared speechless. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are your names?&quot; Said the heads as the left one scanned the younger ones and the <br />
right one scanned the older ones, one eye on each pup while the other two were on the <br />
game they had been playing, one set of hands on her hips and the other crossed between <br />
her breasts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bart.&quot; &quot;Jenny.&quot; &quot;Kevin.&quot; &quot;Marcy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I shall be address as Madam, Nanny, Governess, Miss, or Nana when you speak of me or <br />
to me. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Miss Martha.&quot; &quot;Yes Miss Martha.&quot; &quot;Yes Nana Martha.&quot; &quot;Yes Nana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Now that Martha's transformation was complete, Martha herself wondered if in <br />
long term, only two heads, six eyes, and four arms would be enough if the pups were to <br />
continue to grow in numbers, but for now they were enough. She thought of this calmly <br />
and logically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now Master Bart off with you!&quot; Pointed in the direction she had come. <br />
<br />
Bart started, he wasn't used to being ordered around, there was the Master and Alpha <br />
Female of course but... just looking at this imposing and bizarre being he suddenly felt <br />
smaller, but also somehow, safer? <br />
<br />
&quot;I won't ask again.&quot; Her voices were perfectly almost icily calm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Madam!&quot; <br />
<br />
Bart was off like a shot. <br />
<br />
Martha knelt down and picked up Bart's controller with her lower right hand while her <br />
other hands ruffled the head fur of the remaining pups, &quot;Now,&quot; Her heads smiled, &quot;Tell me <br />
how you play this game?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pups faces brightened. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen read over Bart's perfectly good hand writing, they had a bit of time before the rest <br />
of the staff was due to start coming so they had a little time before they had to begin (and <br />
would be Martha's turn to ask the game of five other members of the staff).<br />
<br />
Jensen read over the ideas, &quot;Garden staff into humanoid elk and pigs to double as a food <br />
sources? I can appreciate the inventiveness Bart but don't go turning into Kaylee.  While <br />
the game might keep them docile and manageable, it's all too possible for outsiders to see <br />
them.  And we're going to be letting the estate's greenery take it's natural course from <br />
now on so they aren't precisely going to be needed anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart said, &quot;But we are going to need a fairly good sized game herd to support the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good point. Can you ever order game animals? All the same we're going to have to <br />
balance out how many people we can make legally and plausibly 'vanish.' And again there's <br />
too large a chance of discover if they're left humanoid. And -again- we need to be careful <br />
on how many people up and -vanish- around the Smiths, otherwise people will start <br />
asking questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand father Master. Maybe we can just change two into a mated part of NON-<br />
anthromorphic non-intelligent deer who will attract natural ones and will reproduce in <br />
response to the demand of the pack's intact. Jenny is working on buy some of the <br />
undeveloped land behind the estate more.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you write down only -nearly all- of the staff being made female?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart shrugged, &quot;Father Master, if you had that many females, you would either have to <br />
spend all day pleasing each other, or they'd possibly end up killing each other to be with <br />
you. Leaving one or two male to tied the rest over when they can't have you is the most <br />
logical solution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, I see, you're the smart one son.&quot; Jesen rubbed his former father now child's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you father Master.&quot;'<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want the ones who chose Dare to become your business vassal lords?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With some good wording on the Dare, they'll become ultimately my and Jenny's shadows <br />
in the real world. Effectively extensions of ourselves to interact with those not yet part of <br />
the pack in Glendale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet part of the pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've got to admit a Glendale populated only by wolves is a pretty sight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather NOT have a nuclear bomb dropped on us son. And we don't know yet if the dare <br />
can be used on someone outside the city limits even if the person using the game IS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart laugh nervously, &quot;Heheh, I suppose we should wait to see how much the Game can be <br />
used to transform someone's reality not just effect people. If can't alter reality or the past <br />
itself, or rather, the perception of anyone anywhere who interacts with us, I suppose <br />
people WOULD wonder about a town of wolf people if they didn't think it was normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let's just focus on the estate! We can worry about the whole town a long long time from <br />
now!&quot; Plus while the idea did excite Jensen, he didn't see the point in taking over the entire <br />
town at this point, in particular with the sheer amount of -risk- involved!!  Who knew who <br />
also had the game? And who knew what they'd do if they realized someone had taken the <br />
game beyond a 'petty personal spite' level? <br />
<br />
&quot;It was just a idea father Master... &quot; Bart apologized. <br />
<br />
Jesen looked at the next idea, &quot;Son. this one is very very very interesting. I have to say it's <br />
rather original, and I have to say that I find it rather amusing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you approve?&quot; Bart asked hopefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd have to say I do. Do you have the dare written out for the victim who says transform?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes I do!&quot; Bart handed it to Jensen. <br />
<br />
Jensen grinned. He liked this one indeed, he could see how it could be useful. <br />
<br />
'You shall transform into a seven and half big bad wolf female cub named Alice in heart <br />
and mind but keep your adult wits. You will love and obey the pack and the master Jensen <br />
the big bad wolf, your new father in all things and never shall your love for the pack and <br />
master/father fault nor shall your loyalty.' Jensen if he had ever read the book would have <br />
noted that was the age Alice was in Through The Looking Glass. <br />
<br />
'In the real world your body will look like it's made of solid glass, but you shall be <br />
indestructible and want for nothing physically nor shall you mind in the least.  You shall <br />
be able to enter mirrors with all the surface tension of water. When inside world within <br />
mirrors you shall appear to those outside the mirrors as a ghostly transparent flesh and <br />
blood wolf girl. You shall be able to travel between mirrors within a fraction of the time it <br />
would take to move between them in the real world. You'll be able to peak over the mirror <br />
frames. You can pull others into the world of mirrors with you, those who aren't part of <br />
the Big Bad Wolf pack already will turn into creatures like you, unbreakable little girl living <br />
glass wolves in the real world, and ghostly appearing flesh and blood wolf girls to those <br />
looking inside the mirrors who shall also love and obey the master and pack and in turn <br />
listen to you. If a mirror is shattered with you in it or partially through, you shall not be <br />
harmed in any way and that doorway will simply be closed. Every mirror in the universe <br />
would have be gone for you to have no way back into the real world.' <br />
<br />
&quot;You think she'd be useful as a spy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And security in some respect.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bart thought o the guy whose job it was to clean the windows... a drifter with no family <br />
and no friends and no enemies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bart... I think I have just the person to become our little Alice.&quot;</p>
