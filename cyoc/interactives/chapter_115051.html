<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, are you ladies interested in a foursome?&quot; asked Martha Anderson, as she snuggled up to her friendly neighbors.<br />
&quot;You know we&#39;re always interested in playing with you dear,&quot; began Frances Twist, as both she and her wife embraced the other woman. &quot;But with us being devoted married lesbians, that would leave poor William out in the cold.&quot; After the Thanksgiving orgy of last year where she got curious about how man cream tasted straight from the source instead of out of their wives&#39; furry chalices, Frances wasn&#39;t about to irritate Samantha ever again by doing something that would upset her and interfere with their marriage.<br />
&quot;Maybe there&#39;s some bi-woman you can call who wouldn&#39;t mind a real hard and anxious cock instead of a dildo?&quot; suggested William. The werefox was getting hornier by the second and while he knew the Twists were off limits, there wasn&#39;t much keeping him from releasing his fursona and taking his wife right there in the Twists&#39; living room.<br />
&quot;The possibility is out there,&quot; admitted Samantha, even as both she and Frances continued to caress and tease Martha while everyone was still dressed and in their human forms. &quot;But besides the fact Maggie Lawson will be on the sidelines for at least a month since bringing her son into the world; with me in office, let alone running for mayor now, we haven&#39;t had too many outsiders join us, if you know what I mean,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;Surely there must be someone ready, willing, able, and available?&quot; asked William, even as he felt his hardening cock ready to burst out of his confining pants.<br />
&quot;Hmmm....&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Oh Eric...&quot; purred Frieda Knight, even as the werepanthress felt the barbs of his werepanther cock slide in and out of her love canal.<br />
All her male lover could do was moan in pure delight, as his cock continued to pump in and out of her hot pussy while Eric continued to enjoy the tasty treats between his other mate&#39;s legs.<br />
&quot;He is so talented,&quot; groaned Spencer Lawson, wiggling at every minute touch while she continued to suckle from Frieda&#39;s teats.<br />
&quot;Yessss...&quot; moaned Frieda, while both ladies continued to play with each others ears, which turned out to be an erogenous zone for the three weres. &quot;I&#39;m about ready to hit orbit and go super nova!&quot;<br />
&quot;We know,&quot; said the others, practically in unison, because of the unique bonds they all shared.<br />
Soon all 3 were shuddering in pure pleasure from experiencing not only their own orgasmic bliss, but that of their partners as well, before collapsing in a heap of fur snuggling together on the floor of the Anderson&#39;s household basement.<br />
<br />
UPSTAIRS...<br />
&quot;Oh Nate! Harder! Faster! Deeper!&quot; exclaimed Jean Talbot the weretigress, even as she felt her fiance plunge ever deeper into her well moistened cunt. &quot;Keep fucking me so hard you drive that wonderful lupine rocket of yours back up my throat!&quot; she purred.<br />
Her werewolf partner&#39;s only reply was a brief grunt even as he continued to thrust into his future wife, his top knot already well into her as Jean demanded even more.<br />
Soon Nate was howling and Jean roaring in expressions of pure pleasure as they both experienced what they craved.<br />
Then he collapsed on top of her, Jean&#39;s hard nipples pressing against his furry chest, sated, at least for the moment.<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; exclaimed Jean, even as she hugged her partner and started licking his muzzle between kisses. &quot;I know we&#39;ve been rutting practically non-stop since our were-wedding, but I have absolutely no idea what&#39;s gotten into me now. Not that I&#39;m complaining...&quot; she said with a smile, before thrusting her hips to remind Nate as to where his hard cock was at the moment, still locked within her.<br />
The werewolf paused to sniff the air before saying, &quot;Eric and his ladies must be in the house. Remember: there is something about their individual scents combined when they rut that creates an aphrodisiac. Even though the basement&#39;s sound proof, which is why we can&#39;t hear them, it isn&#39;t smell proof.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it certainly is a <i>very</i> POWERFUL aphrodisiac,&quot; observed Jean, even as she flipped them over and started riding Nate&#39;s cock again. &quot;I know we never got a chance to explore the possibility last time the 5 of us were all here, but do you think Eric and his ladies would ever be interested in having a grand old orgy with us?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; was Nate&#39;s muffled reply, considering he was orally enjoying a muzzleful of Jean&#39;s ample bosom when she asked the question.<br />
<br />
IN THE SAFE ROOM of Moon Lake General Hospital...<br />
Were-rabbit Doctor Helen Thompkins awoke dazed and confused, uncertain where she was and what had happened over the last few hours. Then the lady discovered she was laying in the furry arms of werelion Peter Talbot.<br />
HER werelion!<br />
<i>It REALLY happened!</i> she realized with a smile. Despite the fact he was at least a good foot taller and much more muscular than any were-rabbit, let alone her.<br />
Not knowing what else to do, she resumed snuggling against his furry chest, noting the stark contrast between their fur qualities, when Peter stirred.<br />
&quot;Hello darling,&quot; he said, staring at her.<br />
&quot;Hello yourself,&quot; she replied, before they kissed.<br />
&quot;Have I mentioned how cute your little pink nose looks, even when it isn&#39;t wiggling?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Several times, but you can say it again and I won&#39;t mind,&quot; answered Helen, while running a paw across his chest. The doctor in her took note of the fact that despite the vigorous &quot;exercise&quot; he had been through of late, his wounds were healing nicely. <i>Once his fur grows back, you won&#39;t even notice the slight scar he&#39;ll have,</i> she observed.<br />
&quot;Listen,&quot; began Peter, sitting up enough to look at her more closely. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re aware of this, but I&#39;ll be graduating from college at the end of the upcoming Spring semester and then will be opening my own accounting firm. In fact, although I&#39;m not officially in business yet, I already have two clients,&quot; he added, thinking about his father&#39;s automobile restoration company and Nate Anderson&#39;s Lawn Care service.<br />
&quot;Commendable, but why tell me?&quot; wondered Helen.<br />
&quot;Because I want to show that I can and will be a good provider,&quot; began Peter, while taking her dainty paws in his much larger ones. &quot;Even if helping you through your time of need doesn&#39;t produce a child, I&#39;d like you to be my wife and share the rest of your life with me,&quot; he said, proposing.<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; said Helen in disbelief. <i>So Peter calling me Helen Talbot earlier wasn&#39;t a dream!</i> &quot;You do realize that between medical school, my residency and internship, let alone acquiring my license that even for weres, I&#39;m about a good decade older than you.&quot;<br />
&quot;So?&quot; asked Peter. &quot;I want to marry you. The rest is mere details.&quot;<br />
There was no hesitation before she kissed him.<br />
&quot;Is that a yes?&quot; asked Peter when their lips parted.<br />
&quot;You do realize that with what we&#39;ve been through, I&#39;m probably looking at a severe sanction, if not the outright removal of my medical license,&quot; Helen reminded him, not knowing of the unique circumstances that led to her craving the werelion in the first place.<br />
&quot;I shall always be there for you dearest,&quot; vowed Peter.<br />
&quot;Does that mean you shall also protect me from anyone who might consider me prey instead of your wife?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Even if it&#39;s another werelion?&quot; asked Helen.<br />
&quot;Of course! They would have to go through my dead body to ever touch a hair of your wonderfully soft pelt,&quot; he swore.<br />
&quot;Then kiss your wife and show me how much you love me Mister Talbot,&quot; said Helen.<br />
&quot;With great pleasure Mrs. Talbot,&quot; replied Peter, before they started celebrating their engagement and were wedding together.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;As much as I love him, will that kid ever go to bed?&quot; wondered Joan Morning Star, whispering in her new fiance&#39;s ear, even as they watched young Darrell Cooper running around the living room of the Cooper Cottage with a toy airplane, pretending he was a pilot.<br />
&quot;Your guess is as good as mine,&quot; replied Sheriff Douglas Cooper. He was currently off duty for the night and enjoying the moment, snuggled on the sofa with his wife to be. &quot;He didn&#39;t have any sugar today, did he?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not that I&#39;m aware of,&quot; whispered Joan. &quot;But ever since I accepted your marriage proposal earlier, all I&#39;ve been wanting to do is rip off our clothes and rut you till we both collapse from sheer but pleasurable exhaustion.&quot;<br />
&quot;Like I tried explaining to you earlier, that&#39;s because we haven&#39;t consummated our were-wedding yet. As far as nature is concerned, we&#39;re now an officially married couple; although Washington State and the rest of the world still requires us to get a marriage certificate before they&#39;ll consider us man and wife.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mrs. Joan Cooper does have a nice ring to it,&quot; she said, snuggling closer to him.<br />
&quot;I know. Truthfully, I never thought the day would come when I found someone I love so much that I&#39;d even consider popping the question, let alone actually ask, but I&#39;m glad it has, and I&#39;m especially glad it&#39;s you,&quot; he said, before kissing the top of Joan&#39;s head.<br />
Joan grabbed a nearby throw blanket and put it over Douglas&#39; lap before she reached inside and started to unzip his pants.<br />
Yet even as Douglas shifted his position on the sofa to give his fiance more access to her objective, his phone started to ring.<br />
At first he was going to ignore it, until the ringtone switched to the theme from <i>Adam-12</i>, indicating it was someone from the Sheriff&#39;s office trying to get a hold of him.<br />
Joan reluctantly put her gestures on hold, just short of her goal, as her fiance said &quot;Hello. Sheriff Cooper here.&quot;<br />
Even Daring Darrell of the air stopped in mid-step and paused his around the (living room) world flight as Cooper listened to the announcement.<br />
&quot;Sheriff? Deputy Danvers here. We just got an anonymous tip that Freddie Parker is expecting more reinforcements by dawn and plans to break his son out of jail while everyone&#39;s at the Labor Day picnic tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;DAMN!&quot; exclaimed the Sheriff, standing upright and not even noticing his fly was open. &quot;How credible is the tip?&quot;<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t recognize the voice, so I&#39;m not certain who called, but the man roared before hanging up.&quot;<br />
<i>Leon Talbot has someone watching Parker?</i> wondered Cooper, before saying, &quot;Okay. Wherever she is, find Agent Reed and apprise her of the situation. I&#39;ll be down there as soon as I can,&quot; before hanging up.<br />
&quot;Honey?&quot; said Joan, looking up at him from the couch.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m truly sorry my love,&quot; replied Douglas, before giving her a passionate kiss on the lips. &quot;Duty calls. I&#39;ll try to be back to you and Darrell as soon as I can, but don&#39;t wait up.&quot;<br />
And then he went to go put on his uniform.</p>
