<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian looked at Cameron, and laughed.  The human was burly, but nothing compared to his own magnificently powerful orcish physique.  Tied to his own rape rack, orc-seed leaking out of his ass, Cameron was a pathetic sight to behold.  Best of all, the human had liked it, by the end.  Brian was satisfied with his revenge.<br />
<br />
He walked to the other side of the room, enjoying the feeling of his thick cock, which rubbed against his massive thighs with each step.  Brian was an elf at heart, of course, but he couldn't help but enjoy the feel of the orcish body.  He ran his hands across his thick, juicy pecs, and felt down his rippling, powerful stomach.  That old ring had certainly been more useful than he had ever imagined.<br />
<br />
Brian looked inside one of Cameron's cabinets, and was surprised to find and entire cask of good wine.  Awash with the satisfaction of his recent fuck, Brian decided to celebrate.  He grabbed the heavy cask, and easily carried it to a table.  He removed the stopper, and proceeded to drink directly from the cask.  <br />
<br />
After several minutes, the cask was empty, and Brian felt pleasantly warm.  A feeling of drunken heaviness spread throughout his body.  His bulky orcish physique could handle quite a bit of alcohol, but a full cask of good wine was too much.  Brian sat down, his head spinning.  Leaning against the wall, he passed out.<br />
<br />
Cameron had watched the entire episode with interest.  He barely regretted the loss of the wine – he saw an opportunity.  He struggled against the bonds which held him to the rack.  The big orc had tied them very tightly, and they would not give.  But Cameron was no bean-pole himself; his own body had a very respectable amount of muscle (if nothing to compare to the huge orc sleeping in the corner.)  Cameron began methodically pushing against his bonds, hoping to stretch the rope that held him there.  As tightly as it was tied, it was still leather, and leather stretches.  He put all his might into this effort, but tried to make little noise – this would all be for naught if Brian awoke.  <br />
<br />
Cameron strained and strained, and after several minutes, the bonds began to give, just slightly.  Cameron redoubled his efforts, and after several more minutes, was able to slip a hand out.  Exultation filled him, as he untied his other hand, and then his legs.  He was free!<br />
<br />
Out of the rack at last, Cameron paused to rub his wrists and ankles, where straining against the leather had made them raw.  He was free, but only so long as the orc didn’t catch him again.  But wait – that had been an elf earlier!  Cameron considered the situation, and decided upon a rather risky plan.  Quietly, he made his way to Brian’s huge, sleeping body.  He knew that the elf had used some sort of magic item, and it had to be something small, since he had been nude at the time.  Cameron saw the ring on the orc’s thick finger, and smiled.  <br />
<br />
Gently, Cameron lifted Brian’s hand, and tried to slide the ring off.  He had a hard time, due to the orc’s thick fingers, but at last it came just a little.  Brian murmured something, and Cameron froze.  But Brian did not wake up.  Cameron grinned, and continued sliding the ring off, until it fell into his hand.  <br />
<br />
The human stepped back, holding the ring, and watched as Brian’s body slowly deflated, losing its greenish hue, and the elf that had originally caught Cameron’s eye returned.  With a wicked glint in his eye, Cameron slipped on the ring.  He waited, but nothing happened.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm,” he thought, “I think the elf said some word to make this damn thing work.  What was it?”<br />
<br />
He looked at the ring, but it was plain gold.  He concentrated, looking for any sort of clue, and a word appeared.  Cameron smiled.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Brian awoke, his head still clouded with wine.  He tried to roll over, but found that he couldn’t move.  What was going on?  He tried again, and found that he could move he shoulders, but not his arms, and his hips, but not his legs.  “What?” he croaked.<br />
<br />
“Ah, you’re awake,” came a familiar voice.  <br />
<br />
Brian’s clouded eyes had a hard time focusing, but finally, the blur in front of him cleared up.  It was that human!  Somehow he had gotten free!  Brian tried to sit up, so he could teach that human another lesson, but he felt weak and useless.  He was able to see just enough to realized that he was an elf once more!<br />
<br />
“I waited for you to wake up,” sneered Cameron, “because I want you to see – and feel – everything that’s going to happen.  Bexoijksr.”<br />
<br />
Brian didn’t understand what was going on.  Then, he looked on in shock, as the human began to swell and grow, becoming taller, thicker, and somewhat greenish.  Tusks appeared in his mouth, and his nose flattened, into an orc’s snout.  Thick mountains of muscle grew out from Cameron’s spasming body, and the former human’s cock grew thick and long, rising above a set of oversized balls.  <br />
<br />
“Oh no,” whimpered a small voice, in Brian’s mind, “I am so screwed.”<br />
<br />
With a shock, Brian realized that the human was now as big an orc as he had been - and was still growing.  That small voice inside Brian’s head became a shriek, which escaped from his lips.<br />
<br />
Cameron laughed, a deep, evil, orcish laugh.  “You fear me?” he mocked, “You don’t know the half of it!”  He raised his arms, bloated with thick, powerful muscle, and flexed.  Brian’s eyes goggled at their size and hardness – the human had become the freakiest orc he had ever seen.  “And look at this,” laughed the orc, grabbing his cock.  It was a huge piece of dickmeat, bigger than anything Brian had ever seen before – it was at least one and a half times as big as his own orc pecker had been, and that had been one huge orc cock.  <br />
<br />
The orc/human laughed, “I guess this ring works better for those of us who already had muscle and cock, hmm, my pretty little elf?”  Cameron walked forward, his huge johnson bobbing with each step.<br />
<br />
Brian despaired.  Here he was, back on the rack, about to get fucked.  Only this time, it was by a freakishly huge orc, with a trouser python big enough to rip him apart.  A freakishly huge orc, with a freakishly huge cock, who would not only want to have his fun, but would want to make Brian pay for his own deeds, an hour earlier.  This was certainly a mess.<br />
<br />
The huge orc approached, a leering grin on his face.  “Yes, little elf, *I* WILL FORCE YOU!!!”  For effect, he flexed his pecs.  Brian watched in sickened horror, as the two huge mounds of muscle bunched up and out, cut by powerful striations.  <br />
<br />
Cameron rubbed his huge cockhead across the little elf’s stomach.  Brian’s middle was firm, but nothing like the cobblestoned path that ran up Cameron’s torso.  Precum dribbled out of Cameron’s slit, and was spread across the elf’s belly.  The orc laughed diabolically.  “Now I fuck the shit out of you, little elf.  Now you pay for what you did.”</p>
