<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, I think that&#39;s everything,&quot; Richard said as he finished his discussion with Leon.  &quot;I just have one more question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Leon responding as he nodded his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s the best place to get clothes?&quot; Richard asked.  &quot;Samantha mentioned Awareness and Target, but what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm...&quot; Leon muttered as he stroked his chin.  &quot;One of the problems that we face as large weres is that we get big when we change, as I&#39;m sure you saw.  That means that, unlike smaller weres, there aren&#39;t clothes that can fit both forms of us.  Anything that&#39;ll fit our human form would be torn to shreds in our fursona forms.  Likewise, anything that fits our lion forms would fall off when we go back to our human forms.  Awareness is a good shop, especially with smaller weres, but not that good for us larger weres.  I&#39;d suggest Target, as they&#39;ll have things that can fit the new you.&quot;  Leon paused for a moment and said, &quot;Oh, and try to go cheap.   That way, if you have an accident, and change with your clothes on, it won&#39;t be an expensive mistake.  Just tell the store that you&#39;re looking for something large, and they&#39;ll understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Richard said as he nodded, &quot;That&#39;s a good point.  The last thing I need is more bills.&quot;  With that, the two walked into the same room as Regina and Rose.  &quot;So, how are you ladies doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose smiled and said, &quot;We&#39;re doing fine.  Just having a discussion between the two of us.&quot;  She turned to Richard and said, &quot;I have an appointment at the hospital at 2:30.  To see...if...you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Richard said as he took a deep breath.  He took a quick glance at his watch and said, &quot;Well, we better get going then.  There are things that we need to take care of.&quot;  He turned to Leon and said, &quot;Thanks for everything.  What you&#39;ve told us has been really helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And thank you for coming,&quot; Leon said as he gave a handshake to Richard, &quot;And stay in touch.  I&#39;d be curious as to how the newest members of our group are doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do take care of yourself,&quot; Regina said as she gave a quick hug to Rose.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will,&quot; Rose said as she returned the hug.  With that said, Richard and Rose left the home and climbed into their van.  Richard started the car as Rose buckled herself in.  As the two started to drive off, Rose said, &quot;Well, that was pleasant.  Regina gave some helpful advice, and it wasn&#39;t near as confrontational as I thought it&#39;d be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we just have our own little pride to take care of and that&#39;s about it,&quot; Richard said.  &quot;Still...I can&#39;t believe it.  If you told me that I&#39;d become a werelion last week, I wouldn&#39;t believe you.&quot;  He shook his head as he said, &quot;This is just all strange to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rose said in agreement.  After a bit of a pause, she continued, &quot;I&#39;m a bit worried about our kids.  I mean, they&#39;re still a bit young, and I&#39;m not sure what to tell them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard nodded and said, &quot;Rachel already approached me about joining were society this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose looked at Richard and exclaimed, &quot;She did what?  And what did you tell her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Richard answered while squirming in his seat a little, &quot;I didn&#39;t exactly give her permission, but I did say that I&#39;d need to see the boy first.&quot;  He took a breath, &quot;Even without that law, I still think she&#39;d join anyway.&quot;  He paused as he shook his head, &quot;And given how we joined...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose took a breath and shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m not exactly fond of the idea that our daughter...having sex and all.&quot;  She looked out the window as she continued to think.  &quot;But, if we don&#39;t ask...if we don&#39;t tell...things might be worse.  Maybe Regina is right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; Richard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We should be open and honest with our kids,&quot; Rose answered.  &quot;I&#39;m worried about our reaction.  What if we tell them no?  What if they go behind our backs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things could be made worse,&quot; Richard finished.  He sighed and said, &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to talk to them tonight.  About being weres and stuff.  Let them know that they can always talk to us, no matter what.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rose said as the van approached Target.  Richard found a nearby parking spot and the two of them climbed out of the van and to the entrance of Target.  As soon as the two of them walked in, they were approached by a clerk as she asked, &quot;Can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Richard said, responding to the clerk, &quot;We&#39;re looking for new clothes.  Something large.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; the clerk said, &quot;Oh, I see.  You&#39;ll want to head to the back of the store.&quot;  She pointed in the general direction of the back of the store.  &quot;You&#39;ll find what you need back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Richard replied as he and Rose made their way to the back of the store.  At first, the clothes that they saw would fit a normal, unchanged person, but a bit too small for them as they were currently.  As they went to the back of the store, the clothes looked much bigger.  Richard whistled as he said, &quot;They weren&#39;t kidding when they said that they had good stuff.&quot;  He picked up a pair of pants and held it against his body.  &quot;Just wish we had our new sizes to make this easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we don&#39;t,&quot; Rose said, &quot;So we&#39;ll just have to make due doing this the old-fashioned way.  Take what we think might fit, and try them on in the dressing room.  We&#39;ll work from there.&quot;  She took a close look at Richard, and then shuffled through a stack of pants.  She had a rough idea of his size before he changed, but at this point, she was making her best guess.  She took pants of several sizes, along with several shirts and handed them to Richard.  &quot;Here, try these on,&quot; she said as pointed to the dressing rooms.  &quot;Let&#39;s see what fits and what doesn&#39;t.&quot;  Richard did as he was told and went into the dressing room.  After some shuffling and changing, Richard walked back out and presented himself to Rose.  &quot;Hmmm&quot; she said to herself as she examined her husband&#39;s clothing.  She noticed that his pants were a bit too tight and that his shirt did little to hide his new physique.  &quot;Try something a little larger,&quot; she said as he pointed back to the dressing rooms, &quot;These clothes are too small.&quot;  Richard went back to change, and when Richard came back out, Rose examined him again.  &quot;Mmmm...&quot; she said in thought, &quot;These fit better.&quot;  She took a quick glance at the size tag and said, &quot;Okay, this could work.&quot;  She also examined his shirt and noticed that while it fit better, it still did little to hide his new self.  &quot;Well, it shows more than I like, but I suppose it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;  She took a step back to examine her husband and said, &quot;Yeah, this will work.  Get six more of these pants and six more shirts, and I think that&#39;ll cover us for the week.&quot;  She turned to grab a few dresses, shirts, and pants and said, &quot;Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve got things I can try myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Richard said as he started to shuffle through the clothes.  Now that he had his sizes, it was a fairly easy task for him to pick out what he liked and what fit him.  He picked out enough clothes when he heard the door to the dressing room open and Rose got his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; Rose asked as she posed for him, &quot;What do you think?&quot;  She was wearing a yellow sundress that while it fit her, did little to hide her new figure.  Richard looked agasp at his wife as she turned around for him.  She smirked and said, &quot;Judging from the look on your face, it&#39;s a good fit for me.&quot;  She went back into the dressing room to change back.  As she did so, she called out, &quot;Oh, and I got my measurements while you were looking, so I&#39;ll be picking things out for myself.&quot;  As she finished changing back, so had her new clothes on a hanger.  She approached Richard and looked at what he picked out.  &quot;Not bad,&quot; she said with a bit of a smile.  She glanced up at the clock and said, &quot;We need to hurry.  We have our 2:30 appointment at the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Richard replied.  &quot;So, let&#39;s grab what you want and check out of here.&quot;  Rose nodded as he said this and put the clothes into the shopping basket along with Richard&#39;s new clothes.  Rose did pause to look at some stuff, and sometimes she put it back, and other times she put in the shopping cart with a smile.  As the two made their way to the front of the store.  Richard estimated that they had enough clothes to last for a while, and it should be enough for day-to-day wear.  The two of them walked to the front of the store and a helpful clerk checked them out.  Richard saw the price of the clothes he was buying and just about blanched at the total but paid for it anyway without any complaint.  Once they were checked out, the two of them walked back to the van and loaded the clothes into the van.  They then climbed back in and started their drive to the hospital.</p>
