<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The car pulled up suddenly along the road by the side of the dingy old hotel - a single light on the front porch leading into the front desk dimly blinked off and on, the set up largely unchanged for most likely decades. The streets were lightly misted, and the moon hung fat and bright in the sky. This was the big, rotten apple. The city on the coast that had for years sustained both the hopes and dreams and the despair and nightmares of its residents. New York City - and one of its many downtown, more rundown districts. The city was home to many crooks and criminals, and tonight, two such neerdowells had sped away from a heist that they thought they had escaped with flawless alacrity. <br />
<br />
They were a man and a woman, both dressed in all black clothes - a black coat, black t-shirt, black jeans and black boots. They wore thick balaclavas, the man&#39;s icy blue eyes staring out of the holes, while the amber eyes of the woman darted around. Checking for any sign they were either followed or that the police were on their way at all. No sign of sirens, and no hint that anyone working for the ones they stole from were in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
A nod from both, and they removed the balaclavas.<br />
<br />
The man had thick, messy brown hair, a slight bit of stubble giving him just that bit of rakish, roguish energy that suggested he was a dashing thief from the world of film rather than the cocky, brash burglar he really was. It didn&#39;t hurt his presentation that his handsome features and natural ease and charisma lent itself to such a perception. He had a lean, muscled build, strong and broad shouldered, but not so heavy as to get in the way of his movement while he and the woman were on their way out.<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s features were pitilessly beautiful, a cold, calculating sneer on her face as she held the satchel containing their prize. It was a team effort, but she had yearned due to her kleptomania to see for herself, to touch and cavort, to hold the item and relish it. Her hair was long, strawberry blond, and tied back while she wore the face mask - and now, she readily let her hair down. Her build was superb, athletic, toned and curvy - her breasts were very generously sized indeed. These two cunning criminals were more than simply partners in crime...<br />
<br />
The young male thief traipsed around, wrapped his arms around the woman, and planted a heavy, passionate kiss on her lips - one she readily returned. They were also lovers. <br />
<br />
As they broke off the kiss, the mist and the light droplets of moisture clinging to their faces, the woman said, &quot;Glen, you are a very, very sexy man, especially right after a heist.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Brenda,&quot; Glen said with a cocky grin, &quot;I&#39;m glad I can fulfill everything you want in a man. I&#39;m skilled. I&#39;m nimble. I&#39;m ruthless. And I have---&quot; He then grunted as he felt her wrap her arms around his midsection and grope his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have such a sexy little ass, a beautiful body, and a handsome face.&quot; Brenda responded, looking over at the walkway leading up to the front desk area of the hotel. Not all that much of a front desk, but they&#39;d made sure to keep their reservations here in advance of their scheme. &quot;And you&#39;re smart. Thinking to get a place this out of the way and below suspicion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it babe,&quot; Glen said, leading the way indoors, keeping his balaclava stuffed in his coat inside pocket, &quot;Once we have these things sold off to the fence, we&#39;ll be living life a lot more comfortably. I certainly won&#39;t be making you suffer through this kinda shitty hotel from hell ever again.&quot; Glen was the kind of guy that got off from thrills. Back in high school, he got into fights just because it was exciting. Man he was hell on his folks. And now, he&#39;d left boring old Oklahoma and traveled, made his way, and met a beautiful woman just as interested in thrills and illicit activities as he was.<br />
<br />
No surprise, he&#39;d been at half chub during the robbery, and with their spoils between them and the hotel right there, the culmination of their effort...well, let&#39;s just say Glen wasn&#39;t lacking for excitement or readiness. As they walked in, Brenda stepped up near him and cupped his groin then and there, rubbing him right through his jeans. And for his part, Glen bit his lip and just enjoyed the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s feeling excited.&quot; Brenda whispered in his ear, &quot;Just make sure you&#39;ve got enough stamina to keep me up a couple hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, I will <i>fuck you &#39;till the damn sun comes up.</i>&quot; Glen growled, a promise made then. And a promise he intended to keep.<br />
<br />
Once the two of them entered, the exceedingly tired looking front desk employee sipped again at some coffee and then tilted his cup, looking at the heavily dressed, slightly damp couple that came in. Thankfully, as far as Glen and Brenda&#39;s getaway went, the young man had no idea that he was looking at a pair of burglars. The windows by his desk were dark, stained by raindrops and leaves. The desk itself was old, and likely had been there longer than the man who stood behind it had been alive.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have reservations,&quot; Glen stated, and produced the printed reservation proofs. The website for the place was largely extremely basic, and existed entirely to drag it into the digital age, kicking and screaming. The front desk clerk promptly looked at it, shrugged...<br />
<br />
And took out a pair of keys. The clerk was a light brown haired, brown eyes nerdy guy, thin and trim, and even the clothes he wore that day hung awkwardly on his build. He found himself looking at the extremely attractive, athletic woman and the rakish stud by her side...and blushed just finding himself thinking of one or the other. &quot;H-Here you go. Enjoy the rest of your night, you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two of them took their keys and walked away toward the staircase leading to their second floor accommodation, Glen cheerfully whispered to Brenda, &quot;...think he wanted to suck my cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Small wonder,&quot; Brenda stated, keeping close to him and holding their spoils inside her coat, concealed from the nerdy clerk, &quot;You&#39;re probably the hottest man he&#39;s seen all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why must I be cursed with such outstanding, handsome looks...?&quot; Glen grinned as they stepped into the staircase, and quickly moved up, the two of them already beginning to exchange kisses and light patting, touching each others&#39; body and preparing to enjoy whatever remained of the night. As they stepped out into the tan walls and grey carpeted dreary locale of the 2nd floor, they would hear a distant sound of a single gunshot.<br />
<br />
Nothing close by, or any risk to them. But it was just another reminder of the kind of place they were holding out in. Before long, they reached their destination - and Glen opened the lock up. It took a little doing, but eventually he had the door figured out. &quot;Just needs a little...oomph!&quot; He forced it open with a bit of application of his shoulder, leaving the two of them to look in - seeing the two bedroom stay they&#39;d be enjoying.<br />
<br />
A single dresser, a single table, a bathroom consisting of a shower and just enough room for a separate toilet, and all of it in that same abominable combination of tan wallpaper and grey carpets. It was almost the platonic ideal of a low cost / low class hotel. The beds were at least not in the worst condition. And the window owing to the dark outside and the limited light from the moon was left almost like it was staring out into a world of pure darkness. <br />
<br />
Oh, they&#39;d seen plenty worse in their countrywide misadventures, but this was just...boring in how bad it was. Which almost felt worse. The door was quickly shut behind them, they didn&#39;t get this far to be sloppy. Brenda took a seat on one of the beds and started peeling off her coat, leaving the spoils to fall by the two pillows. She relaxed, leaning back and stretching, looking at the ceiling fan constantly spinning above. Keeping the room in a state of cool but crisp.<br />
<br />
By the time Brenda took a look over at Glen, she wasn&#39;t exactly surprised to see him already stripped down to his boxers. Standing there with his arms by his sides, glancing at her with a bemused, eager expression. Brenda looked him over and relished the chance to enjoy his tanned, lightly scarred skin and his tight, muscled body. &quot;Glen, can you bring yourself over? Before we really get started, I want to---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna feel my body. Feel how tight my muscles are. You like my ass, babe. You can&#39;t get enough of it---&quot; Glen gloated.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lady can&#39;t deny what she wants.&quot; Brenda then cooed with delight as Glen marched on over, turned himself around, and stood by her, letting her strip down a bit herself - to her bra and panties - and then began feeling him. Touching his abs, running her hands along the toned obliques by the side of them. When she pinched one of his nipples, she giggled at the sound of him letting out a held breath. She pushed her hands down further, groping at his ass. <br />
<br />
She swore for someone who didn&#39;t exactly workout commonly, he just naturally had a very sexy ass. She honestly looked forward to him getting a full gym membership when they made their fortune on this latest heist. If this was what he got from merely living a life on the road, as best he could, well...she would be eating good once he was actually trying. &quot;Don&#39;t you ever let yourself go to pot, Glen Harper. Or I will turn you into Johnny Law myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to worry about me becoming some fat fuck, babe,&quot; Glen sighed as he enjoyed her hands on his thighs, glutes and quads, &quot;I&#39;ll always be your hunk, as long as we&#39;re together.&quot; Honestly, he wouldn&#39;t doubt that she&#39;d do it. It would be petty - but she was just that kind of person. And honestly, he wouldn&#39;t have her any other way. After all, that was one way to encourage him to reject going soft as it were.<br />
<br />
Before long however, Glen was feeling distinctly hard. Need coursing through his blood. Desire was overwhelming him, pressing him to just go ahead and enjoy himself. It was when he felt her hand linger long enough on his cock that Glen decided enough was enough. Now it was his time to enjoy this. And he enjoyed their intercourse most of all. Feeling their tight bodies against one another. Glen whispered in a dark, needy tone, &quot;Babe. I am as hard as I can fucking get. I wanna fuck, and I wanna cum, and I&#39;ll make damn sure---&quot;<br />
<br />
As he turned around, he saw that she had her bra and panties off, gesturing for him to come ahead and do as he wished.<br />
<br />
Glen&#39;s underwear before long joined the rest of his clothes on the floor. He wrapped his arms around her, letting her still enjoy the feeling of his body with her hands, and began thrusting, moving to insert his cock in her pussy. Feeling the wetness a couple times, and then easing himself in. Biting his lip as he felt her tight lips around his manhood, the throbbing unit turgid and pleased within her. Glen wasn&#39;t exactly an inexperienced guy.<br />
<br />
He enjoyed a wide array of lovers across his 27 years of life. Building up a reservoir of technique and stamina that few men could boast access to. And he had been with Brenda long enough to know exactly what her weak spots were, how to please her, and how to handle it in such a way as to guarantee the experience she wanted... But she was hardly his first.<br />
<br />
He had lost his virginity at 12, in an encounter most would&#39;ve called statutory rape. But it taught Glen something. You want something, you take it. She wanted him, she took him. So two years later, he met the woman who&#39;d introduced him to sex again. And he made it clear that if she didn&#39;t want certain things made known, he would be enjoying her body more regularly. In retrospect, she was not a very good Bible Studies Teacher.<br />
<br />
And so their torrid session went on. <br />
<br />
Glen pumped his hips fast and hard into her wet pussy, feeling her breasts under his hands next as he shifted posture a bit. Poised on top of her, thrusting away and enjoying the feel and the scent of her under him. And as Glen&#39;s hips humped away, he didn&#39;t notice the bag containing their spoils beginning to shift upon the very same bed they now frolicked on.<br />
<br />
A thick, red jewel slowly fell out of the bag and on to the bedsheet. Shaped somewhat like a large fang, in its reflected surface as it seemed to look upon Glen, it briefly showed the image of a pitbull. And as it looked upon Brenda, the image of a husky briefly flashed in the surface. Perhaps they hadn&#39;t gotten away quite as cleanly as they thought.<br />
<br />
And as Glen pumped his cock further and deeper into Brenda&#39;s pussy, he didn&#39;t notice that his cock was slightly redder, slightly thicker than usual - though that latter part Brenda certainly noticed. Her moans and gasps and cries of pleasure were getting louder, which Glen just attributed to his skill set...</p>
