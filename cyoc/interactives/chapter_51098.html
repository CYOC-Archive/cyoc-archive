<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh, and my name is Zelipe please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abbey looked at him funny, &quot;Why are you asking permission on weather or not your name <br />
is Zelipe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I mean my name is Zelipe.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are a Big Bad Wolf.&quot;&nbsp;They all turned to Amy who had her hand on Chester, who didn't <br />
change in the slightest and remained a mundane dog. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sis'?&quot; Zelipe asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just testing our abilities brother, it seems that we can not effect animals. It is possible <br />
our power only effects humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Power?&quot; Abbey asked always curious. <br />
<br />
Alice nodded, &quot;When we were reborn into the pack Abbey-chan, we were given the ability <br />
to turn anyone we touch and call so into a member of the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Just like us!&quot; Abbey clapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Alice said simply, &quot;Not just like us. And only vaguely similar at best I would dare say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nani?&quot; Amy wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone we bring into the mirror world who is not part of, or serves the pack is turned <br />
into a child glass wolf like I am.&quot; Alice spoke, &quot;It is how I was able to make Abbey and <br />
Samantha like I am to be reunited with our mothers.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And we became so cute!&quot; Abbey giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;You were cute before,&quot; Alice said, &quot;Now you are cute, made of unbreakable glass in the <br />
outside world, and able to travel anywhere with mirrors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot; Samantha added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indestructible?&quot; Amy repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Alice said, &quot;We can not be destroyed, we do not need to breath, eat, or go the <br />
bathroom in the outside world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's horrid.&quot; Amy spoke and had to quickly cover her mouth and bowed several times, <br />
&quot;Gomennasai! But, what if you were trapped in pitch blackness at the bottom of the ocean <br />
with the water pressure too much for you to move? What if you were buried inside molten <br />
rock for a million years? You would be all alone, trapped until wind and rain wore it down <br />
or the sun died of old age, and you would then drift through the infinite of the universe <br />
until it too died of old age... Gomennasai but, it is so very frightening to me, can you even <br />
move onto the afterlife?&quot;<br />
<br />
The glass wolves all looked at each other, and Zelipe looked at Amy, &quot;Sis...&quot; She said in an <br />
unhappy voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are indestructible so we don't shatter.&quot; Smantha said, &quot;And we don't know if we're <br />
going to live forever and, and can we please, not talk about? Please?&quot; The girl said looking <br />
unsure.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Samantha-chan, you have my word I won't bring it up again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please do not.&quot; Martha said putting both her hands on Amy's shoulders, &quot;There are some <br />
things children like you should not need to think about or talk about.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sadly I must concur.&quot; Mr. P said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish Martha-San,&quot; Amy replied leaning against her governess. <br />
<br />
zelipe leaned against Mr. P, feeling like a third wheel in the room full of girls. He had been <br />
one himself not twelve hours ago, but already he as feeling slightly awkward. <br />
<br />
That was when Beatrice began running through the house making a familiar shouting, it <br />
was time for dinner. <br />
<br />
&quot;Follow us.&quot; The glass wolves said. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I thought you said you didn't eat.&quot; Zelipe said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;We said we do not need to eat in the outside world.&quot; Alice said, &quot;We have dinner with our <br />
mothers inside our world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your world?&quot; Zelipe had to ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;The world within mirrors.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The mirrorverse.&quot; Abbey said. <br />
<br />
Amy nodded then an interesting thought occurred to her, &quot;If you've taken the reflections of <br />
dresses... does that mean there are girls somewhere who are going to buy dresses and <br />
appear in their underwear when they next look in the mirror?&quot;<br />
<br />
All three glass wolves started, they hadn't considered that.<br />
<br />
Given how they were all naked, Martha didn't exactly worry about the girls discussing such <br />
things, but her left head turned to Zack's children while her right head turned towards <br />
Jensens, &quot;That can be thought about at a later time, come now, let's not be late for <br />
dinner.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
The dinning area was more full than it used to be, some of the gem wolves were <br />
considering weather it needed to be expanded or not. Amy looked rather impressed but <br />
seemed slightly offended by the lack of proper furnishings and how her fellow pack <br />
members ate like savages, but, when in Rome. She could at least appreciate the sense of <br />
order the pack members had to each other at least. <br />
<br />
Zelipe was also slightly intimidated by the entire mess, however a kind push from Bart and <br />
he was bloodying his claws and muzzle with the beset of them, Bart already planning on <br />
having Zelipe join himself and Kevin on a evening public service to the local rabbits <br />
weeding out the stupid and slow from their gene pool again. <br />
<br />
Garnet, in spite of her best efforts, ended up not only next to Amethyst but also in a one <br />
arm hug of hers as well, Garnet just sighed resigned to her fate. <br />
<br />
Maxine was talking lividly with Tourmaline and Coral about the places they had all seen. <br />
<br />
&quot;We aren't being replaced are we?&quot; Millie asked slightly worried to Robyn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah Sugah,&quot; Robyn replied, &quot;We ain't, Maxine-girl is just makin' -new- friends, she's not <br />
losin' the old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope so.&quot; Millie nodded. <br />
<br />
Jasper was trading joke with Nick, who had to avoid some of his more colorful ones since <br />
Nicole was using his lap as a seat as normal. <br />
<br />
Orpal and Cobalt of course would be sitting next to each other, the rest of the gem <br />
colored wolves gathered together in their own group. Lazuli and Topaz sat near Ashley <br />
who was amazed at how fast their pack had grown, and in somewhere, a tiny part of her <br />
worried they had grown too fast too soon. <br />
<br />
June and Pearl took their children to sit with them along with Zack, separating the cubs <br />
from each other, but June and Pearl had only known their pups this afternoon onward, and <br />
they wanted to get as much time with them as possible. Zelipe felt positively relieved to be <br />
in his mother's arms, while Amy's leaned back in hers, observing it all and drinking in the <br />
feeling of security. She sighed when see looked at her father's knee purple and the ice <br />
keeping down the swelling wish she had the power to make it go away. <br />
<br />
 As normal, the cheerleaders were Kaylee's chair she sat down in next to her mate, neither <br />
complaining nor resenting. <br />
<br />
While Amy and Zelipe had seen Alice in the mirror, they were still surprised when the <br />
triplets had entered with their children now all wearing victorian area clothing carrying on <br />
a relatively more civilized manner from the rest of the pack inside the massive gold wood <br />
framed mirror behind Jensen. <br />
<br />
The pups ate, but keep giving looks at the two new pups that were Zack's children and <br />
their new playmates. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sis, it's not like she's gonna steal the throne right out from under ya, we're still <br />
dad's pups, and still the oldest, and their dad's not gonna cause any trouble anymore, you <br />
don't need to be such a grouch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm gonna be Alpha female someday, I can be a grouch if I want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? Marcy, Kevin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes big brother?&quot; they said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Combined tickle assault!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait-what-stop! AHAHAHAHHA-HA-HA-HA-HA! MOMMY-HELP!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee calmly reached down between Hope's arms and added her gentle caress to Jenny's <br />
tickling. <br />
<br />
The omega and silver Martha and Mr. P merely looked at each other at this and shrugged <br />
not intervening... just yet. <br />
<br />
Jensen informed the entire pack of Nicole and the males' mission there and now. <br />
<br />
Lawrence and Roger looked happy for a chance to show off their strength. Nick hugged <br />
Nicole. Sarah hugged Ulysses, then so did Terri and Sandi. <br />
<br />
<br />
Megan, who had been forcibly placed where she was by the combined efforts of Sarah and <br />
Margot, looked at the muscular brother and said a little hesitantly, &quot;Uh, Roger... good luck <br />
on your mission tomorrow... I hope everything goes well.&quot; <br />
<br />
Roger looked at his sister and patted her on the head, his voice boiling over with <br />
confidence, &quot;Thank you Meg', don't worry, everything will.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd go too if I could!&quot; Amber declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry kiddo,&quot; Nicole said, &quot;We have enough extra ladies for this mission.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amber frowned, &quot;I'm not a kid, just short.&quot; Hoping no one found out she wasn't eighteen <br />
for another eight months. <br />
<br />
&quot;And as flat as a bored.&quot; Jasper joked. Amber hit him as did Nicole. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; Amethyst protested, &quot;Can't we all just play nice?&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy for childish moment wondered if she could if she could make herself an adult with <br />
her power and Amy a kid, but since they were both wolves already that was impossible. <br />
'Oh well, some games just aren't meant to be.' <br />
<br />
Anne was glade that Madam Serenity was going to be dealt with tomorrow, maybe with <br />
that woman out of the way she could take Serena out on that offer she gave next time they <br />
met at church. <br />
<br />
 +++++++++<br />
<br />
After dinner, before Bart dragged away Zelipe on a twilight hunting expedition with <br />
himself and Kevin, Jenny had brought the two new cubs to the office the shadows passing <br />
for them with barely a thought from her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Zelipe asked.<br />
<br />
The shadow gave his name in a totally calm, indifferent, and practical voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're just shadows.&quot; Jenny shrugged, &quot;Pay them no mind, they do whatever me and Bart <br />
would do. They make it so we can still work to maintain the estate and our holding and be <br />
in six places at once and don't have to work all via e-mail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked at them, her 'eyebrows' closing together, &quot;They're empty inside.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh', they're shadows.&quot; Jenny replied not even looking at her or the shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's... cruel though... &quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked at her confused, &quot;It's not like they're part of the pack, so why should we <br />
worry? And they serve the higher cause of the pack, we need them like this to survive at <br />
the estate that is our -home-. The grotesques all used to be human but now serve the <br />
pack by protecting it. And Jack and Marcine are the two main deer out in the back of the <br />
estate, and their herd provide us with food so we don't need to rely so much on the <br />
outside. It's all for the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amy slightly nodded emotionlessly. <br />
<br />
&quot;At any rate,&quot; Jenny said totally forgetting the whole thing, &quot;You and your brother better <br />
get started on writing up that you and your dad are moving out of town and whatever, and <br />
the legal dissolving of some of your stuff and making sure Zylphia is cleared for home <br />
school. It's what we did for our mom and dad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Amy said, not wanting her father to get in trouble over not coming to school, &quot;But <br />
we really should see about educating our parents, they only have high school educations <br />
after all, they need to learn if they're going to lead us all.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jenny started then shrugged, &quot;We provide all the leg and legal work for them, there's no <br />
need for them to do things they don't want to, that's our job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy looked at her half-brother Zelipe and saw him nodding more or less toe very Jenny <br />
said if somewhat reluctantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;If that is what Alpha-Sama wants,&quot; Amy said, &quot;Then so be it. But we should bring it to his <br />
attention first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want.&quot; Jenny said, &quot;But seriously, you two better get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy took Zelipe by the hand and the two of them climbed into the desk and cross eagle <br />
style began writing up note and sending in the proper forums on-line to both legally <br />
vanish and for 'Zylphia' to be recognized as taking home school. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Now that the pack really didn't care much for how smelly or how dirty the inside of the <br />
household got, the cleaning staff was more free to simply lounge around. And the cooking <br />
staff, with the pack's pallet's being rather simple, were now the gargoyles that protected <br />
the pack from enemies on the outside. <br />
<br />
Jasmine as it was now doing what she had wanted to do for years as a male and a staff <br />
member of the Smith household staff... organize the DVDs, LDs, and VHS into a <br />
recognizable pattern. It seemed a rather small thing to do, with the threat of Serenity and <br />
the addition of the jewels and the two new pups to the pack all in one day. But everything <br />
was happening so fantastically fast anyway, that Jasmine needed some calm and some <br />
sense of order. Besides, she knew Master would approve. Also she needed to make sure <br />
Margot didn't go selling the movie collection on ebay. Some of these movies were special <br />
pre-order only editions and nearly impossible to find, which meant Margot would see <br />
them as a gold mine for the pack to exploit, 'Not if I had anything to say about it.' <br />
<br />
Jasmine knew technically they had all the time in the world, and one old woman in the <br />
know shouldn't be a threat to their pack, and so she had all the time in the world to do <br />
this but, she just could shake this odd feeling. That somehow, some way, the sooner she <br />
got this done the better. Maybe she was just tired of waiting for a chance to do it.  &quot;Maybe <br />
I'll finally find that copy of The Last Emperor we've been missing for two years...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it a good movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it's very well done and ... eh?&quot; The sea green Jasmine turned around to see the blue <br />
green Terri and the teal Sandi (with one black eye) leaning on opposite sides of the <br />
doorway to the video storage room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if we help?&quot; Terri asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll make the evening go by faster.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aren't you two going to check out the new males?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw.&quot; Terri said, &quot;After this morning, me and Sandi need something else, besides, you <br />
looked to be busy and what pack mates would we be if didn't lend a hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don't want the incident with Sandi's black eye to be brought up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Sandi finish. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well come on in, it's crowded like Hong Kong and we new and improved size doesn't <br />
make it any easier to get around in here, I've knocked over my piles twice so be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, gotcha.&quot; Sandi replied as the two wolves got to work with their pack mate widdled <br />
the night away. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
In the bed room, with the triplets and Kaylee only, Jensen sat on the bed going on what <br />
would be done,  &quot;So the team will be Nick, Zack, Roger, and Lawrence, Ulysses, Sarah, <br />
Ashley, and Nicole. Alice will be observing as an emergency back-up plan in case we run <br />
into trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee asked, &quot;What about Jasper and Opal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're going to the island along with Cobalt and the rest of the gem wolves as normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's routine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't lie to me dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're the pack's insurance policy. If something happens to us and for whatever reason <br />
we don't make it to the island, the gem wolves will be the only member of our kind left, <br />
Opal and Jasper are to make sure we don't die out in a generation.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee was nearly overwhelmed, wasn't the pack supposed to exist just for the two of <br />
them? But the way Jensen spoke, very differently from how he had last week when he had <br />
started this entire venture, it was like they existed for the pack instead. That made Kaylee <br />
feel uncomfortable, she enjoyed her video games and other creature comforts almost as <br />
much as she loved Jensen and their children. <br />
<br />
The triplets meanwhile all looked at each other and nodded, glade Master was accepting <br />
that their easy winning streak by the law of averages wasn't going to last forever. <br />
<br />
&quot;This has been a very very very long day.&quot; Jensen said as Julie sat behind him and began to <br />
stroke him between the legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;It seems all our days have been since we joined the pack.&quot; Fran said sitting next to him on <br />
his right scratching him behind the ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;But we are all here at the end of the day.&quot; Darla said rubbing herself against him. <br />
<br />
&quot;And now,&quot; Kaylee said sitting his lap looking at him, &quot;Let's show you reward for a long <br />
day's work.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen grinned and breathed in deep, &quot;Julie, Darla, Fran, you are my mates, you are dear to <br />
me as Kaylee is dear to me, you have helped the pack in more ways than can be counted <br />
and thus you are dear to the pack as well. I am happy beyond words to have all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Master.&quot; The triplets said as they and Kaylee descended upon him. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me to please you.&quot; Lawrence said kneeling in front of Amethyst.<br />
<br />
Roger nudged him aside, &quot;No, allow me to please you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amethyst looked at them both innocent, &quot;Okay, I guess you guys will have to take turns <br />
right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If we get any more pack mates with knockers better than hers, shoot me.&quot; Isabelle said <br />
flatly. <br />
<br />
Hope said crossing her arms, &quot;I don't think she even realizes the super power she has over <br />
the males either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace sighed, &quot;I'm actually sorry Zack is out of commission for the evening.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto.&quot; The other two clink members said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Going anywhere?&quot; Nicole asked calmly holding onto the end of Nick's tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nowhere at all.&quot; Nick said obediently. &quot;Though I think the mountain is going to come to <br />
me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that mountain, she seems pretty preoccupied with the other mountains.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
 <br />
Reading some quick facts on the internet Brian said to his wife (who was reading over the <br />
notes Madam Serenity had given them),<br />
<br />
&quot;The ratio to female to male in a pride is roughly six to one, a pride that has more than <br />
one male is called a coalition. Meaning that with fourteen of us, only two out of the <br />
fourteen will remain male. Meaning that if we did it by pot luck I'd only have a one in <br />
seven chance of being one of the males.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One in six if at least one of the officers is a woman.&quot; Felicity said not looking up.<br />
<br />
&quot;The point is dear, if we go through with this, and we try to be fair by being random, there <br />
is a good chance we could both end up lionesses. And remember we need to -explain- all <br />
of this to Mary don't forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we're luck at least she's too young to be that curious about the birds and the <br />
bees then... but seriously Brian, I asked you to drop that remember? We'll cross that <br />
bridge when we come to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you really want to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... Mary deserves it. And so do we... What if we ask Mary to use the game on us <br />
tonight? She doesn't need to know all the details. Then we can use the game on the <br />
officers ourselves tomorrow who agree to come and you'll be safely one of the males.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They could see that as cheating on our part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not,&quot; Felicity said, &quot;Some of Madam Serenity's notes say that the game can effect <br />
even -existence- we can ask Mary to word it so as far as reality is concerned we've always <br />
been biologically similar to her. If we phrase it right then even she doesn't need to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might cause more trouble than good, and the police might see it then as me trying <br />
to 'gain more lionesses.' ... That's the part that -does- scare me dear. What if you and I <br />
aren't enough for each other anymore and don't even mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why we're going over the information on lions and Madam Serenity's notes first <br />
remember? To make sure we don't end up like the Jensen monster and don't see the laws <br />
of civilization as 'quaint.' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still wanting to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same.&quot; Felicity hugged him from behind.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Having written down twice, typed up trice, photo copied four times,  and saved on a <br />
memory stick, and archived on a remote server, and mailed to her home address, the <br />
formula for the white magic powder that destroyed he game's presence, Madam Serenity <br />
returned the original scroll to it's rightful owner. Of course she gave him also an update on <br />
Mary, her parents, and what they were rather obviously planning to do. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hiroshima, Hiroshima all over again.&quot; Father Mike muttered to himself in dismay and <br />
disbelief. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd have to agree.&quot; Madam Serenity said, &quot;I tried to persuaded them against it, but they <br />
fully believe their daughter has always been a lion person, and their family photos and <br />
news clippings back up that belief. They thinking using the game to make Mary human <br />
would be a violation of who she is. So like any parents, they want to be the ones to make <br />
the sacrifice and become like her instead. I think negating Jensen and his pack is just the <br />
toll payment to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If we didn't need to use that curse to cure the victims, and we chance of finding someone <br />
else with the game willing to help are slim to none I'd suggest you use the powder or Mary <br />
before they can convince her of this foolishness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd hope Mary won't go along with it, but the way she is right now it might be all she can <br />
do against parental pressure. I couldn't exactly ask them to let a woman they only just met <br />
take their only child!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and I wouldn't have asked you to either, it's just aggravating how it feels like the <br />
curse is mocking us almost, like we have no choice but to use it, or let Jensen just continue <br />
to use the evil thing himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity decided NOT to mention how Paul had pitched the exact same idea about a <br />
counter to the wolves which she had shot down. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you?&quot; Trevor asked seeing Judas with some bandages on his sides. <br />
&quot;Please don't tell me you went to see the wolves for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had I'd be disemboweled. After you left with Mary I had to tell my younger brother and <br />
friends to call off their search, but my elder brother cornered me and tired to end my part <br />
of the bloodline. ... Neither of my brothers approve of my theology but my older brother <br />
thinks it's his duty to cleanse the species. Don't worry, this isn't the first time this has <br />
happened and won't be the last, there are some things in life you simply have to learn to <br />
live with.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;just like that? You accept your big brother wants you dead and you move on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;' Shake the dust from your sandals and move on.' &quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was past bed time for the pups, Bart's hunt had gone rather well with Zelipe and Kevin <br />
both managing kills (leaving Bart now with a running kill score of zero). The new pups <br />
were amazed when Abbey, Samantha and Alice had climbed into the mirror, now dressed <br />
in night gowns and clipped into the reflection of the bed.  Given how the rest of them were <br />
all nude and in the fur it was rather jarring, Amy and Zelipe could both see why Marcy <br />
considered it weird. <br />
<br />
The two new pups piled onto the bed, now six of them, their fur brushing up against each <br />
other, much to Jenny's agitation, it was okay with her brothers and sister, but sharing the <br />
bed with two pups who weren't even related to her felt a little agitating, she'd ask father in <br />
the morning to get them their own room or make a new bed. Her siblings didn't even care <br />
and accepted their pack mates with open arms. <br />
<br />
Jenny wondered about Amy strangely, wondering if she went inside the mirror world, if <br />
Amy would end up dressed like an imperial princess, or a miko. Jenny was forced to admit <br />
she could see Amy as either. How old did you have to be to be a shrine maiden in japan <br />
anyway? Jenny admitted (silently of course) that she had no clue. <br />
<br />
Jenny was fast asleep when Kevin felt something move and opened his eyes. He saw Amy <br />
silently and carefully step over Mr. P and Chester. Even moving stealthy every movement of <br />
the eight year old was hypnotic. <br />
<br />
The naked wolf child stood in front of the waning incompletely through the window, it <br />
shinning bright on her. It made her coat look like shimmering white with crimson line <br />
flowing through it. Amy sighed as she looked out the window, looking transcendent by <br />
moonlight. <br />
<br />
She said in a low, kind voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I've become part of something beautiful as it is metamorphosing from <br />
something ugly, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly... but I feel like the cocoon will be <br />
forced open from the outside before it can become a butterfly, and shall die.&quot; Amy turned <br />
around, her eyes misting, almost sparkling for brief instance in the moonbeams. She <br />
looked at Kevin, or maybe the pups in general, Kevin didn't know if she knew he was <br />
awaken or not. <br />
<br />
Amy smiled, &quot;But... but I'm -happy- that I got to be a part of our family even if it shall be <br />
for only a very short time. I feel as if a thousand weights have been removed from my <br />
shoulders and I can see the world a thousand times clearer. And even if I live a thousand <br />
more lives, I shall treasure this brief instance in forever like a thousand diamonds.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Queen meowed, &quot;Princess, Prince, Trinni, Quinn, Kathy! Come here!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mother!&quot; The five tabby kitten said together in human english as they came over to <br />
her from the television they had been watching (the size of a wall from their perspective) <br />
on the evolutionary trail of the great cats.<br />
<br />
Trevor accidently got caught in the stamped as they crawled over him. Princess came back <br />
and kissed him on the nose before hurrying along to her mother. Trevor sighed happily. <br />
<br />
As they nursed, Queen looked at them, then at Trevor as he came up beside her. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're beautiful aren't they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like you.&quot; Trevor nuzzled against her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still amazed you managed to teach them all how speak the language of humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one or two words so far. It's slow learning, kids just pick up language faster than <br />
others... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It also proves they're your kittens. None of Bast's perfect creations have ever spoken the <br />
language of humans before. Well, except you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor... it's funny... I've had several litters before them... I'd mate, I'd breed, I'd let them <br />
go on their way but... now, I think I'll be -sad- to see them go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's endearment, something else I think I've managed to teach you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deviously.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am a cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen nuzzled him again, &quot;Trevor, I do believe that I am happy like this, a breed of <br />
happiness I've never known before, I don't think ANY felidae has known before. I think I <br />
changed because of you. It scares me, but, I don't I'd want to go back to how I felt before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can appreciate that. I don't think I'd want to go back acting superior around people who <br />
didn't take care of themselves as much as me before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen laughed, &quot;Are you saying you became more human by becoming a cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... maybe...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor dear... I am happy but,&quot; Queen licked her kittens and then looked sadly at Trevor, <br />
broke eye contact and shook her head, &quot;I'm afraid this isn't meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen?&quot; Trevor asked nervous. <br />
<br />
&quot;These are the shadows of things that can no longer be...&quot; His family's living room <br />
vanished. And as Trevor looked, his, their kittens winked out of existence one by one. <br />
<br />
&quot;..no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen's head neatly and cleanly rolled off her shoulders at Trevor's paws like the Cheshire <br />
Cat. &quot;Yes Trevor. I'm sorry. You can't turn back time. But please....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be brave.&quot; <br />
<br />
A huge black and gold shadow rose up behind Queen's still neatly sitting headless body <br />
looking down at them with glowing red skull eyes. <br />
<br />
Trevor started awake, smacking into his bed basket and toppling the whole thing over, <br />
ending up in a tangle mess of little cat sized pillows and blankets. He looked around. No <br />
Grim reaper, no Queen's head. No kittens that would never exist. Trevor shuddered. &quot;First <br />
my subconscious tortures me with Death taunting me on how much time I -don't- know I <br />
have, and now I dream about that... Be brave huh? ... Alright Queen, I'll try.&quot;</p>
