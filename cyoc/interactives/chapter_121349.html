<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kimberly woke suddenly with a gasp. The day&#39;s events momentarily forgotten, she sat up and attempted to get her bearings. The clock on her dresser said 7 P.M. and there was half folded laundry and luggage strewn all about. Attempting to sit up in bed resulted in a lot of rustling and a full view of her enlarged cleavage. In a rush, it all came back to her. Her search for a vacation activity, the strange shop and its stranger owner, the revelation that magic was real, the box, and finally the headband.<br />
<br />
&quot;My my, what an afternoon that was.&quot; she said in her silky new voice. Kimberly sat up on her bed. Remarkably, her clothes and sheets were completely clean, with no evidence of her earlier activities being left behind. The tingling that marked her changes was gone too, though her movements seemed to carry an inherent pleasure to them now. Most notably, her feet and toes still rippled lightly with pleasure when she moved them.<br />
<br />
Pushing herself off he bed with an uncontrollable and sensual &quot;Oof&quot;, Kimberly stood and, hips swaying, walked into her bathroom to check herself out.<br />
<br />
Stepping in front of the mirror she found herself face to face with a blonde beauty. Shimmering golden locks framed a gorgeous face magically made up to look sultry. Her outfit certainly fit the idea of a sexed up Alice costume, and her new figure didn&#39;t tone down that image. With a body like this, there&#39;s not a modelling agency out there that wouldn&#39;t hire me instantly, she thought with pride.<br />
<br />
Her reverie was interrupted by the distant sounds of her front door opening and closing and the sound of someone shuffling around. Walking back into her bedroom, Kimberly realized it must be her roommate Sarah coming home from work. She heard footsteps approaching her door. &quot;Oh no!&quot; she muttered to herself, &quot;I can&#39;t let her see me like this!&quot; She hadn&#39;t even begun preparing a way to explain the box and magic in general when they were all at her family&#39;s lodge, the headband had proved too distracting. <br />
<br />
A knock on her door broke through her panicked thoughts. &quot;Hey!&quot; said a perky voice from the other side, &quot;You in there Kimmy? You should come check out this cool new board game I got for the trip!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh salutations my dea...&quot; Kimberly cut herself off quickly as her accented, smooth voice came out unconsciously. &quot;Uhh Kimmy? You alright in there?&quot; said Sarah. Shit, Kimberly thought, gotta try speak normally. &quot;Hey, Sarah,&quot; she said, trying her best to sound normal. It took great effort to not speak eloquently and still came off a lot more sultry than she intended. <br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds great,&quot; she continued, keeping her voice low to try to mask some of the differences. &quot;But I&#39;m not feeling too great. Was at the mall earlier and must have run into something that triggered my allergies. I&#39;m just gonna finish packing then call it a night, you can explain it all to me on the ride out to the lodge tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot;, said Sarah, sounding slightly defeated. &quot;That sucks...but wait!&quot; she said, and Kimberly could almost see Sarah&#39;s undoubtedly eager face through her door, &quot;That just gives me more time to read the rulebook so I can explain the game better!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah great...&quot;, said Kimberly, &quot;Looking forward to it, &#39;night Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight!&quot; her roommate replied cheerfully. <br />
<br />
Kimberly stood there a moment longer, listening to sounds of Sarah&#39;s footsteps moving farther away. Not the best excuse, she thought, but good enough I suppose.<br />
<br />
She started moving back towards her bed. Might as well finish packing, she thought to herself. After a couple steps she paused, realizing her heels made a good bit of noise against the floor as she walked. She needed to get these off before it brought Sarah back over to ask questions. <br />
<br />
Kimberly bent at the waist, reaching gracefully down towards the straps that helped the shoes cling to her feet. As she did, her short skirts were shifted and exposed her ass and privates to the air of her room. She grunted a bit as she felt the slight breeze from her overhead fan wash over her sensitive buttocks. Ignoring the sudden desire to rub herself, Kimberly undid the straps of her shoes and stepped out of them. Her heels remained steadfastly suspended in the air, but otherwise provided no discomfort. She looked to her toes, each individually encased in the silk of her stockings, the dainty shape of her foot perfectly outlined. She giggled and wiggled her toes, some of the familiar tingles erupting as they rubbed against the floor and each other. <br />
<br />
A strange look, she thought, but I can&#39;t argue with how it feels. She padded, silently this time towards her bed and continued the packing she had started hours ago. She floated gracefully on tiptoes around her room folding laundry, packing shoes and toiletries and organizing boxes of foodstuffs. <br />
<br />
After an hour or so, she had everything all packed and placed by her door for the morning. &quot;Oh joy!&quot; she said aloud, before clapping a hand over her mouth to prevent any more jolly exclamations. I&#39;m really glad I didn&#39;t go for any stronger mental changes, she thought, these &#39;good-girl&#39; mannerisms are hard to fight. <br />
<br />
Realizing her work was done for the night, Kimberly turned to go to bed before pausing mid-stride. A devious grin appeared on her face. She picked her phone up from her bedside table. Why not take a few pics? She posed in various ways around her bedroom and bathroom, taking an assortment of selfies and photos of herself. Even a couple shots of her cute heels.<br />
<br />
The days events began to catch up to her however and she started to get quite tired. Kimberly yawned gracefully. &quot;Time for me to retire, I fear.&quot; she said to herself. She tried for a minute to untie the bow that cinched her dress tightly to her waist before giving up. She&#39;d be back to normal by morning anyways, and these clothes were exceedingly comfortable. <br />
<br />
Pulling herself underneath her covers, she leaned over and shut off the lamp next to her bed. She lay her head down on her pillow and closed her eyes. Today had been amazing, she couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of craziness Pandora&#39;s Box would bring on her trip. She rubbed her stocking-clad feet and legs together under the sheets, smiling at the tingling sensations of the silk rubbing between her toes.<br />
<br />
I hope that doesn&#39;t go away, she thought, as she began to drift off, who knew they could feel so heavenly?<br />
<br />
Toes still curling and uncurling in pleasure, fantasizing about the next few weeks, Kimberly finally fell into a deep, comfortable sleep.</p>
