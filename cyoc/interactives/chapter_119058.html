<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The baby sitter who had been watching the two children, (one eight, one fourteen who hated the idea of needing a baby sitter), heard the ringing of the door, and heard the mother asking to be let in. The baby sitting, not thinking much of the absurd news report, opened the door. <br />
<br />
In front of her were two &#39;naked&#39; fury covered women, looking to be half human, half beast. One was two shades of gray on her fur, with long back hair, and seem to be a walking talking, beach balls for breasts wolf woman. The other was a similarly impossibly stacked woman whose features were those a fox, white red and white fur, with back &#39;socks.&#39; The two grinned at the staring and confused young woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, thank you so much for like, watchin&#39; the kids and everything,&quot; the fox woman said in the mother&#39;s voice. &quot;Like, we have a super cool reward for you, right Wolfie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right Foxie!&quot; The wolf woman nodded. The only thing the two still wore was their wedding rings. The two leapt onto the baby sitter even as she thought to slam the door closed and call the police, (which she, like, would have totally gotten a response to eventually, after one of the blue furry bumbos with a star mark one breast could pull herself away from having fun with her &#39;sisters&#39;). <br />
<br />
The baby sitter was practically buried underneath their gigantic beasts that reminder her more of throw pillows that anything else, her struggle lasted an incredibly brief time as the warm, soft, comforting fur of Foxie and Wolfie brushed against her, and their warmth pressed against her. Within minutes, a golden furred coyote woman, with a figure like that of Foxie and Wolfie, was engaged in snuggling with with the first two. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, thanks, that was so totally worth it!&quot; Said the coyote bimbo. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome!&quot; Said Wolfie.<br />
<br />
Foxie meanwhile, dimly noted her children were nowhere to be found. This was no good. &quot;Dears... come to mommy please...&quot; And Foxie began to wordlessly hum a hymn. And the two children, her eyes dilated, came out of their hiding spots, and marched towards her. <br />
<br />
Not even thinking about it, Foxie did what came naturally, and scooped up the two into her arms, pressing them against her gigantic beasts. Which, to her own confusion, began to be used for what mother nature had actually given them to her to begin with. <br />
<br />
She was even more confused as her children shrank down... getting smaller and smaller, until both were just toddlers, their clothes falling off them, after her children had had their fill, and she herself felt an instinct that said they were done, she put them down. The two toddlers looked up at her with understand and comprehension. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, so that&#39;s what happens when someone who hasn&#39;t hit gone through puberty is changed, didn&#39;t know that.&quot; Said Wolfie, &quot;Like, so totally didn&#39;t know that! Cool!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two little fox toddlers looked at each other, both were girls now, when one of them had been a male before. They felt... calm. And... they heard voices... it was... it was every child who had become a furry toddler before them... <br />
&#39;We are the furry, you will be assimilated, resistance is futile, HAHA! Naw! Welcome to the club!&#39; They heard one of the many voices say. In spite of their being so many, there was neither chaos nor monotone silence. <br />
<br />
The toddler furry kept the intelligence of whatever age they happened to be at before their transformation. And now that intelligence was pooled as they could practically just mentally stroll into each other&#39;s memories and look up what they needed to know. <br />
<br />
The Furry Bimbos, didn&#39;t really seem to get hungry, sick, thirsty, and any injury healed at a biologically impossible rate, in fact, the pleasure from each other and from converting others, was really the only thing the furry bimbos really seemed to actually need. <br />
<br />
But the furry toddlers who had been somewhat older before their transformation, began to see how they&#39;d need t starve off some desperate lunatic dropping bombs on major cities around the world, let alone long distance bombardments and tanks strolling in to kill whatever was left. <br />
<br />
The furry bimbos also kept their intelligence, much like the toddlers, but that intelligence was directed towards pleasing each other,  making other please, and making sure the furry toddlers were not in any immediate danger or neglect. <br />
<br />
The furry toddlers, didn&#39;t all speak the same language, but being able to just share their memories, they quickly developed a common language, and were able to mentally communicate from around the planet. They just wanted to play. And this was going to be the ultimate game they&#39;d be playing. <br />
<br />
The furry bimbos wouldn&#39;t be needing money anymore, but they could pool the resources. So their credit card numbers and bank accounts were put to good use. So some of the toddler furries in New York got the idea to keep the stock market in a resemblance of running on wall street according to what could be told on the internet at least. And calling in things via mail delivery paid for online. The economic movers and shakers on the governments back were less likely to allow military action if it was MORE likely to disturb their profits instead of secure them. <br />
<br />
And of course, send messages to families coming via boat or plane to immigrate to the united states that the &#39;bimbo plague&#39; thing was just nonsense and nothing to worry about. None of them would be turned away. <br />
<br />
Also, on online forums, spreading counter rumors, many with contradictory theories, ensuring that those on the extreme left and the extreme right would embrace whichever one that most reflected their own world views. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve found, that we can influence the bimbos, kinda sorta, with our own hymn. It doesn&#39;t change their only context is pleasing others, or making others please... but it kinda works.&quot;<br />
<br />
The furry bimbo as said, weren&#39;t technically any dumber, but all their brain power was being directed towards some rather narrow goals. <br />
<br />
Humans being, modern ones at any rate, had been bred, raised, and conditioned to follow through routines, obey rules and authority figures, and basically not rock the boat as long as there was no apparent LOGICAL danger. As it was, when a delivery arrived with a furry bimbo husky wearing nothing but a trucker hat showed up outside one of the infected cities making a delivery... those on the loading dock were too bewildered, and not wanting to explain this to their boss to protect, and simply went through the motions of accepting the delivery. ... Of course, she spoke in a way that every her words were a turn on, her every motion, her every glance, her every breath, her every step, called out in a way that the men accepting her delivery found utterly irresistible, and she had barely mentioned the idea of a &#39;good bye snuggle&#39; before they had willing followed her into the delivery truck, their clothes upon the floor in seconds, and the two naked furry palomino horse women waved her goodbye, their illogically huge breasts swaying in the air as their tails swept behind them. &quot;Like, come back soon!&quot; <br />
<br />
Also, there was no law against turning people into naked animal women... and there wasn&#39;t going to be as the furry toddler&#39;s collected knowledge pulled every social engineering trick from face book page entries talking about how that would be &#39;oppressive&#39; or &#39;sexist.&#39; Most of it was nonsense, but it didn&#39;t need to be otherwise, as people just wanted to continue their lives. And as long as the bimbos could go through the motions of keeping their pieces of the big machines going (even if their toddlers were the ones stringing them along so they&#39;d remember to be in certain places at certain times), most people wouldn&#39;t feel any sense of true urgency.</p>
