<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kylie grinned maliciously at the eight costumed teens before her. They shuffled their feet nervously before her but did not try and run. Kylie pulled her hat from her head and held it like a trick or treat bag and stood before them.<br />
&quot;For my next trick, each of you will pull something from my hat!&quot; She told them. She stepped up to the first boy and held out the black witches hat. It looked completely empty. He reached inside cautiously, putting his arm inside all the way to his shoulder, and felt around. When his hand came out he held a blood red apple. He said nothing and Kylie moved to the next boy. He reached in much the same and came out with a little sea shell. The third boy received a wilting rose. The forth, a small golden loop. The fifth boy only came up with an hand full of what appeared to be golden glitter. The sixth boy reached in and gasped. When he pulled his hand out he held nothing but the tip of his finger was bleeding. He put it in his mouth and sucked. The seventh was was a bit slower after having seen what happened to his friend before him. He reached in and pull out his item unmolested, he held a diamond tiara. The last boy reached in quickly, not looking into the hat at all and pulled out his item. He held a small golden oil lamp. Kylie then reached her own hand into the hat and withdrew a shining magic wand. <br />
&quot;And now for the fun!&quot; She stepped up to the last boy who had chosen his item. &quot;Abracadabra!&quot; She said and touched the magic wand to his nose. The lamp he held burst into blue smoke and covered the boy. He gasped. When the smoke cleared the lamp was gone and he was no longer himself. In his place stood a the beautiful dark haired Princess Jasmine, wrapped delicately in blue silks. His dark skinned breasts round and perky. Kylie giggled and the boy blushed. She moved on to the next boy in line.<br />
&quot;Thats a very pretty tiara you have their Billy.&quot; Billy stepped back a half a step. &quot;Oh don't be afraid! Here, let me help you put it on.&quot; Kylie took the tiara from his hands and set it gently on his head. She raised her wand. &quot;Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo!&quot; She said and touched him in the nose as well. Whit light glittered brightly hiding the boy from view. When it dissipated Billy stood tall in a glittering white dress, his long blond hair done up beautifully. His feet felt odd and when he looked he saw why. On his feet were tiny clear glass slippers. He let his dress fall back down and hung his head. <br />
The next boy saw exactly what was going on but was confused. He had no idea what would happen to him. All he had received from the bitch witches hat was a bloody finger. &quot;I can see you are a bit confused. Here, let me see your finger.&quot; The boy hesitated but then held out his hand. Kylie kissed the bloody finger, leaving a droplet of blood smeared on her lips. &quot;You should really be more careful around spindles. Especially magical spindles.&quot; With that pillows fell from no where all around the boy. When they had stopped falling all that remained was the gorgeous Princess Aurora, fast asleep on a pile of silk pillows, snoring softly and very daintily. Kylie laughed and moved on. <br />
Next was the boy with the pile of dust. Kylie grabbed his hand and lifted it before her eyes as if she were inspect the golden pile. Shew blew. The golden dust went everywhere ant he boy seemed to have disappeared. The boys next to him gapped in surprise. Kylie bent down and looked at the tiny woman on the ground. She was dressed all in green leaves and had ethereal wings protruding from her back. He wore two of the smallest pearl earrings ever created. He seemed to be trying to say something but the only noise that anyone could hear was the soft tinkling of bells. <br />
&quot;Half way done!&quot; She stepped up to the next boy. She held out her hand, palm up, and he placed the small golden loop in her hand. &quot;Good boy!&quot; She leaned in and grabbed his ear, piercing it with the golden loop. He yelped in surprise, his voice already changing. He crumpled to the ground, his costume writhing around. When he stopped moving Kylie pulled him to his feet. He now wore a colorful gypsy's dress and had raven black hair that spilled over hid tanned shoulders. &quot;You make such a great looking Esmeralda!&quot; She patted his head and moved on.<br />
The sixth boy was pale when she stepped up in front of him. He backed a step away. He stopped moving when he met Kylie's fiery green eyes. &quot;Hold up your pretty flower Sid. We all would love to see it!&quot; He did so, his hand shaking. As he did he noticed the rose had lost all its petals but one. Kylie reached up and picked it. &quot;Times up.&quot; Rose petals flew, twisting and swirling around Sid in a whirlwind. When they settled to the ground Belle stood trembling in his place. A yellow ball gown hugging his new feminine body perfectly. <br />
 Kylie raised an eyebrow at the next boy. &quot;I hope you don't mind getting wet.&quot; She took the sea shell from his and and crushed it. Water rushed up from the floor to swirl around him in a white rapid. When the water settled it was in a tank that now held a red haired woman. Sea shells cupped his small breasts and a long green scaled tail had replaced his legs.  <br />
&quot;The last one! Lets make this one good.&quot; She took the apple from the boys hands and held it up delicately to his lips. He hesitated and then took a bite. The changes started immediately, nothing to obscure them. His lips bloomed a deep red while his face paled. Dark hair fell silky smooth to his shoulders. His costume twisted on his body, changing to a deep blue and the dress falling long down his legs in a bright yellow. His breasts expanded to fill the top, the tops of his pale breasts blushing as red as his cheeks. Kylie stepped back to look at them all. Eight of Disney's hottest women.<br />
&quot;You all look great! But should I let you all get away with only this? It does seem that making you all into gorgeous women isn't much of a punishment... Hmm.&quot; She turned to the crowd. &quot;Should I leave them as they are? Or  should I do something else to our beautiful Princesses!?&quot;</p>
