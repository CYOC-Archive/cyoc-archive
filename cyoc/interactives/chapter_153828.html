<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael came to a decision and started to get up from the sidewalk. Fido joined him and whined as an indication of wanting to know what it was. <br />
<br />
“What did you come up with?” Freddy wanted to ask, but it came out as a serious of loud barks instead. <br />
<br />
“Let me guess, Freddy. You want to know what I decided?”<br />
<br />
Fido went to bark twice, but then didn’t know if Michael remembered their barking communication code, so he just nodded his head up and down. <br />
<br />
“Well” Michael responded. “There’s an old abandoned house about a mile down from here. No one ever goes there, so I think it’ll be secluded enough where we won’t get caught trying to jack you off again. What do you say?”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded as Michael motioned him to follow. <br />
<br />
“Come on boy…I mean, Freddy. Sorry, sorry, sorry.”<br />
<br />
Freddy appreciated that his boyfriend was consciously trying to correct himself, something he wished his parents would do when they treated him like a mere house pet. As mad as Michael could make him at times, Freddy admitted to himself that Michael was thoughtful and considerate of his feelings. In times like this, it was greatly appreciated. He only wished he could speak so he could say it to him with words.<br />
<br />
The walk didn’t seem very long for the two of them. Fido and Michael were so anxious to get there that time seemed to fly by and then, before they knew it, they arrived in front of the house. It was on the outskirts of town. There was no other houses for miles around; save for a few cabins that circled a lake. <br />
<br />
Michael walked cautiously up to the old house, giving the area the once over before signaling Fido to follow. The two walked around the property to the backyard that was unprotected from the elements. <br />
<br />
“No one should be coming here” Michael said as he squatted down to sit in the grass. “Come on Freddy.”<br />
<br />
Michael patted his lap as Fido laid down and sprawled himself on him. <br />
<br />
“Roll over so I can get to your penis, please.”<br />
<br />
Fido shimmed and maneuvered so that his hind legs were in Michael’s lap. His dick was hidden in his sheath, so Michael would have to coax it out of him once again. <br />
<br />
“I wonder if that pheromone spray is still lingering on my hand” Michael thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Michael extended his hand to Fido’s nose. The cold, damp and wet nose attached to Fido’s snout sniffed his hand again, but this time, after a few minutes, no visible reaction was occurring in the dog’s sheath. <br />
<br />
“Great” Michael thought to himself. “I forgot my knapsack, so I don’t have any more of it to spray on my hand.”<br />
<br />
Before deciding what to do, he had an idea. <br />
<br />
“Wait here, Freddy. I have an idea.”<br />
<br />
Fido rolled back over and stood up watching Michael get up to walk back over to the front of the abandoned house. As he trotted alongside him, he saw Michael reach into his pocket and take out his phone. Michael dialed up his mother and she answered the phone. <br />
<br />
“Sweetie?” his mother asked on the other end of the phone. “Did you get rid of the dog?”<br />
<br />
“Sort of” Michael responded hesitantly. “I left it on the outskirts of town by the old, abandoned house. I wanted to make sure it was fed before I saw it off to the woods. Would you mind bringing me my green knapsack, please?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, Michael. Your father needs my attention at the moment.”<br />
<br />
“Mom, please.”<br />
<br />
“Well, alright. Ralph!”<br />
<br />
Michael could hear his mother yell to his father over the phone. <br />
<br />
“Ralph!”<br />
<br />
“What!?” Michael could hear his father reply.<br />
<br />
“I have to bring something to Michael to help him keep the dog out of the neighborhood. I’ll be back in a few minutes. Will you be ok by yourself?”<br />
<br />
“If his thing a ma bob contraption gets the dog out for good, then fine, go! But he better be warned that he’ll be grounded if it doesn’t work and it comes back again!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll mention it dear! Michael?”<br />
<br />
“Yes mom?”<br />
<br />
“You heard what your father said?”<br />
<br />
“Yes mom.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, I’ll be over in a few. Where am I going to meet you?”<br />
<br />
“In the front of the house. I’ll keep the dog in the back away from you.”<br />
<br />
“That’s fine, Michael. See you soon.”<br />
<br />
“Bye Mom.”<br />
<br />
Michael hung up the phone and looked down at Fido. <br />
<br />
“You should hide in the backyard until she gets here.”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded and made his way to the backyard of the abandoned house. He didn’t like being here. This place gave him the creeps. It felt like ghosts haunted the place. This seems like the kind of house that the wizard would have purchased. For all they knew, they had it entirely wrong and this was where the wizard was actually residing. However, Freddy guessed that it couldn’t be true because he’d want to be closer to them and this house was a distance away from where both of them lived. Still, Fido started to get the creeps as he tried to calm down. He hoped Michael would be back here soon. He missed him already.<br />
<br />
Michael patiently waited at the front of the house before his mother arrived. She parked her car on the street in front and got out with the knapsack in her hand. <br />
<br />
“Is this the knapsack you were looking for?” his mother asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes mom” Michael replied.<br />
<br />
“Ok sweetie, hope this works.” <br />
<br />
Michael’s mother gave him a kiss on the cheek before she got back in the car. <br />
<br />
“I’m keeping my fingers crossed that whatever you do will do the trick. You’re very smart, Michael. I believe in you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks mom.”<br />
<br />
She nodded as she drove off and left Michael alone with the knapsack. He was very happy that at least one parent was supportive of him and gave him emotional support. He only wished that his father would do the same; something that remained elusive to him.<br />
<br />
As Freddy wondered whether Michael would ever come back, he finally heard his footsteps and the grating sounds of a knapsack in the distance. Fido’s ears perked up and he got up to trot over to Michael who smiled at him. <br />
<br />
“Let me sit so I can sort through the knapsack.”<br />
<br />
Fido nodded as he slowly backed away while Michael squatted down into the grass and resumed sifting through the bag. He unzipped the top of the knapsack and began digging through it. It took a moment before Michael found a small little strip on the bottom of the bag and pulled it out. It almost looked like a tampon pad, but Fido’s nose could tell that something else was sprayed onto it. Michael zipped the knapsack up again, pushed it to the side and then patted his lap to get Fido to lie down on his back. Fido followed the order and his hind legs resumed its previous position; sheath extended in the air. <br />
<br />
“Smell this” Michael prompted as Fido put his nose to the tampon item and smelled it. <br />
<br />
Again, it didn’t seem to have any effect at first, but after a minute, his stirring loins indicated that it did the trick. <br />
<br />
“Good, it still works.”<br />
<br />
Michael didn’t want to litter, so he left he tampon item on top of his knapsack before spitting in his hand and playing with Fido’s dick. <br />
<br />
“Close your eyes, Freddy, and think of the sexiest scene you can imagine.”<br />
<br />
Freddy didn’t have to close his eyes. All he had to do was look up to Michael and see the sexiest sight right before him. His tongue lolled out and he felt a sense of euphoria as Michael sensually rubbed his dick back and forth. Soon, his knot began to expand and he knew he was close. After a few more strokes of his flailing red dick, Fido began to strain his face before he groaned and shot out a large amount of dog semen all over his face and stomach. <br />
<br />
The streaks of cum continued as Michael slowed down his rubbing until he completely stopped, not wanting to cause pain to Fido’s now sensitive dick. Michael, seeing Fido licking the cum off his face with his tongue, rubbed his belly to pick out what Fido couldn’t reach. After a few moments, the changes started happened again as Fido’s fur receded back into Freddy’s skin and his body mutated once more. Faster than Michael could ever remember it happening, there laid before him, on his lap, was a naked Freddy. <br />
<br />
As Freddy opened his eyes, he smiled at Michael with a look of happiness on his face. <br />
<br />
“Hi sexy” Freddy said to him as he motioned Michael for a kiss. <br />
<br />
After a brief smooch, Michael helped Freddy up as they sat on the grass. <br />
<br />
“Thanks for your help” Freddy said. <br />
<br />
“You’re welcome” Michael replied. <br />
<br />
“Sorry your dad is such a jerk to you, Michael. I know it’s gotta be tough dealing with him all the time.”<br />
<br />
“It is, Freddy, it is. And what makes it worse is, even since I came out, ever since I introduced him to you, his attitude towards me took an entire 180. He used to be so caring and loving to me as a kid. He used to help me build home volcanoes. We used to play with expansive train sets in the basement together. He used to teach me how to use a computer before I got even better than him. He was my everything, Freddy, and that all changed when we started dating.”<br />
<br />
“Michael…” Freddy showed a look of sympathy on his face as Michael poured his heart out to him.<br />
<br />
“To be honest, Freddy, part of what motivated me sometimes to want to leave you when times got tough was because I thought that, if I did, if I lied and said I wasn’t gay anymore, that maybe, just maybe, my dad would love me again.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that, Michael.”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, I’m not a person who wants a whole lot in this world, but one of the things I want more than anything else is for my father to say, just once, that’s he’s proud of me. That he appreciates how hard I work in school. That he appreciates how hard I work to make our relationship, you and me, together, work. That he appreciates me and loves me unconditionally. Just once, Freddy. Just once, I’d love to hear him say it.”<br />
<br />
Freddy saw a tear fall down Michael’s cheek as he wiped it away and put his arm around his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Michael, I’m sure your father loves you very much…”<br />
<br />
“You saw him today, Freddy. Did that look like love?”<br />
<br />
“It looked like a man having an allergy attack.”<br />
<br />
“What about before he even knew that you were in the house?”<br />
<br />
Freddy paused for a moment and then responded. <br />
<br />
“No, not really.”<br />
<br />
“He needs to do better, Freddy. I’ve tried, so hard, to get my mother to try to get through to him, but it’s not enough. She isn’t enough. I’m not enough.”<br />
<br />
Michael began to cry as Freddy grabbed his head and placed it on his naked shoulder and planted kisses on his forehead. <br />
<br />
“You are enough, Michael. I can’t tell you what your father is feeling as I don’t know him that well, but I can tell you that you’re more than enough for me. Actually, you’re more than more enough for me. You’re my everything and I am proud of you.”<br />
<br />
“You mean that? “ Michael asked through a sniffle as some snot landed on Freddy’s shoulder. “Even though I kind of got you into this mess in a first place?”<br />
<br />
The question took Freddy back into the moment as he became acutely aware of his unclothed state. The fact that the two of them were sitting in the backyard of an abandoned house caused him to shudder. He removed Michael’s head from his shoulder and looked at him in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be prouder when you help me break this curse. I believe you can do it. I believe you’re the only one who can help me do it. And together, we will beat this.”<br />
<br />
Michael smiled, not knowing how much of a compliment Freddy’s answer really was, but he decided to take it for what he hoped was how it was intended to be. <br />
<br />
“Michael?” Freddy asked quietly as he surveyed the scene before him. “Do you have any clothes?”<br />
<br />
“It’s your lucky day” Michael responded. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know how lucky I’d consider my day to be, but…”<br />
<br />
Before Freddy could finish his sentence, Michael reached for his knapsack again, put the tampon item in a separate compartment and then began to grab inside the bag to pull out some clothes. <br />
<br />
“I took these from the ground of Sofya’s bush when you changed into a dog on Wednesday” Michael said as he began to hand Freddy his old outfit. “I figured it would come in handy in case this happened again.”<br />
<br />
“You’re really resourceful, Michael. Thank you.”<br />
<br />
Freddy got up from the grass and slipped on his underwear and pants. He put his shirt over his head before Michael tapped some items on his knee. Freddy looked down at Michael as he saw a pleasant surprise. <br />
<br />
“And this time” Michael said “I remembered to bring you shoes and socks.”<br />
<br />
“Great!” Freddy responded happily. “Thank you for remembering to take these. They might be a little dirty, but it’ll do for now until I can get a clean pair of clothes at home.”<br />
<br />
“We don’t have time for that, Freddy” Michael responded hesitantly as he closed up the knapsack and got up from the grass. “Sofya’s…”<br />
<br />
“Oh right” Freddy responded, remembering that it was getting dark outside and they were expected at her house. <br />
<br />
“Maybe we should check…” Michael responded before looking at his phone. “Shit!” <br />
<br />
The phone read 7:15 PM. It also included a message from Sofya. <br />
<br />
“Where R U guys?”<br />
<br />
“Shit, Freddy! We’re already late! Come on!”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Freddy responded as he rushed to get his shoes and socks on before proceeding to join Michael as they ran out the backyard and into the street. <br />
<br />
After racing as fast as they could, they managed to get back into town. <br />
<br />
“Which way is Sofya’s?” Freddy turned to Michael to ask.<br />
<br />
“This way” Michael said as he pointed to the right. <br />
<br />
The two boys raced through the town, with the occasional onlooker staring at them or telling them to slow down. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, they managed to make their way to the front of Sofya’s house. <br />
<br />
When they got to the front door…</p>
