<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To his surprise, it appeared to be a full body suit of an anthropomorphic cheetah, a royal one with Blue fur and Green markings. The fur seemed brighter than most cheetah furs and the spots were larger. Setting aside the body piece, he pulled out the sleeves, belt with tail, feet, and the head piece. The headpiece was astonishingly realistic. He could see that the eyes were a bright blue, like that of a kitten&#39;s eyes, or a husky&#39;s. He seemed excited at first, until he noticed that the chest on the cheetah body seemed unusually large, not like an actual male. This was a girl&#39;s costume. He&#39;d been given a female cheetah suit! Upon closer inspection, to his horror, he noticed that the suit had 3 pairs of breasts on in the manner of 6 loose areas on the torso piece meant to be filled by padding or by flesh.<br />
<br />
He looked over at Kevin, wondering if he was willing to trade.<br />
<br />
Kevin shook his head shaking his hands out in a &quot;no way man&quot; gesture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tough luck dude. But hey, you did say Brian specially made these costumes for us. It will fit you and probably look convincing, who other than him will know that it is you under there? As far as I know, we don&#39;t know anyone at the party, and everyone will remain anonymous under the costumes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin turns to his own box. His box contained a Green and yellow themed Leopard costume with Green fur yellow spots and stripes as well as golden eyes. He noticed that the costume was visibly larger than his build was and the head pieces were also astonishingly realistic. He also noticed that the upper torso area &quot;looked&quot; more buff. It was hard for him to perceive but it felt like the costume was meant to be worn by someone in the top shape of his life, not a massive body builder, but just....athletic.<br />
<br />
Auron looked at the costume in disgust. The arms were slender, the hipline very much like an hourglass. Even the shoes looked too small for even his feet. And yet it was made exactly for his size. Somebody tell him he was just dreaming. He could not be caught wearing this. It had discernable breasts for Pete&#39;s sake! He didn&#39;t want to have his virile image emasculated by this. But as he saw Kevin fitting his suit on, he soon caved in to peer pressure. Slowly, he fitted on his body suit, sliding his legs into the legs and then strapping the sleeves onto his shoulders, In a way it felt like he was wearing pajamas. Pajamas for a woman, but as long as didn&#39;t think about it, he should be fine. As he zipped it up from the belly up, he was surprised to see how well it fit. he stretched and flexed a little, hoping it would tear. To his surprise it didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Kevin slid on the paws on his feet and marveled at how dexterous the feet seemed to be once he put them on. There was no sliding of the foot inside of the paw, the movement of walking around on them felt natural. Next he put on the pants and fastened it with the belt with a tail on it. After tightening the belt to hold up the pants on his skinny frame and adjusting the pants width, he looked down to see how slim his legs still seemed despite wearing the costume. With the exception of the fur, the pants was pretty form fitting though the crotch area was pretty slack no matter how he adjusted the costume. Shrugging, he took off his shirt to put the costume&#39;s torso piece on marveling at how smooth the costume felt against his bared skin. As the instructions read, he put the torso piece on and stuffed the excess material over, then under the belt. After some adjustments it was nearly skin tight and somehow, it gave an illusion of muscles on his torso. He put on the gloves and was surprised to feel how dexterous they were while looking like realistic hand paws. He looked down to marvel at his body seeing what looked to be an anthropomorphic leopard with green and yellow fur. He went into his room briefly and got a baggy pair of shorts and another shirt to put on and was delighted to see that he was able to wear normal clothes on top of his costume. Lastly he put on the head piece that he stuffed underneath the neck scufs then put on the head band with the ears attached and the face mask that held the ears there. The mask fit perfectly over his face and he found that as he moved his facial features, the mask moved as well, though not as expressively. He did notice that he was able to open the mouth quite wide, perhaps wide enough to eat and drink. Ignoring Auron&#39;s costuming he rushed to the Bathroom to take a look at t himself in full costume.<br />
<br />
Putting on the rest of his sleek costume. Auron was flushing underneath the costume. How could Brian humiliate him like this? He deserved better than this. As he saw Kevin flexing in the mirror, he couldn&#39;t help but be jealous. That should&#39;ve been him flexing in the mirror. It should be Auron flexing his muscles with Kevin in this womanly suit with the empty breast area material flopping uselessly on his chest. All that wonderful strength gone to waste. Walking over to the couch his just sat down on the couch pulling out the remote and watching some television. He was just getting into the series of Claymore. Kind of sharp and gritty to watch, but it was nonetheless entertaining to watch. And any chick with breasts was good enough for him, no matter how horrid they were underneath.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kevin came back from looking at himself full length in the mirror without his clothes, satisfied with his look. When he had looked in the mirror and saw himself, he saw a noble and strong beast, a powerful leopard capable of human expression, and lastly, a sexy virile man. A smile was plastered on his face inside the mask. He walked over to his friend, and went around the couch to get a good look at him. It was obvious to him that Auron was upset. The costume he put on was not adjusted by him to fit fully making the costume look.... less than authentic. That&#39;s strange....were the costumes supposed to look authentic? Kevin laughed inwardly when he saw the extra padded fabric for the 3 pairs of breasts on his friend&#39;s costume flop flatly on his chest every time he moved his torso. Deflecting the issue for now, Kevin asked,<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think Auron? Should I keep the clothes on or take them off?&quot;<br />
<br />
Auron looked up at Kevin, from head to toe. To his surprise, it was even anatomically correct for the male. a sheath was there around the hips. He stared at it for a moment before he went back to the television screen. Strangely, he was already feeling comfortable in the suit, his mind revolting the idea. &quot;You look fine as you are, man.&quot; Really, he just wanted to get lost in his anime cartoons, laying back as he tested his mask&#39;s jaws, surprised that they moved astonishingly well.<br />
<br />
Kevin noticed Auron stare at his crotch, he looked down and realized for the first time that he was &quot;naked&quot; even though he was wearing the costume. Embarrassed, he rushed over to the bathroom again to put on some clothes and take the costume off. Strangely though, as he reached to take off his mask, he felt like keeping it on. Shrugging helplessly, he pulled the pants up on his costume&#39;s legs and his shirt. Before returning, he realized how uncomfortable the pants were with his tail in the way, the base of it was pinching his lower back through the belt. He took off his pants again, reversed it to the fly was facing backwards, then put it on again, the tail going through the fly. He returned to the couch and also took a seat to watch Claymore with his friend. At first it was a little difficult, his muzzle was in the way of his lower vision, so he had to change the way he sat to achieve full sight.<br />
<br />
Noticing his friend was still &quot;naked,&quot; he turned to Auron and said in a joking manner, grinning beneath the mask, &quot;A young lady such as yourself shouldn&#39;t be sitting around &quot;au naturale&quot;, that is unless you want to do something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Auron slowly turned his head, growling frustratingly. &quot;Don&#39;t make this any harder than it already is, Kevin.&quot; Auron sat back, but then had a strange feeling that his tail would get hurt if he did. So he sat up and readjusted his tail, letting it hang on the side of the couch as he continued to watch claymore. He had picked it up on point, watching it nonstop for 13 episodes, but the series still had a level of ickiness to it. Still the claymores were pretty hot. He could stare at their chests all day. He couldn&#39;t help but notice having Kevin next to him made him feel a bit less uneasy about wearing the suit. Maybe because he wasn&#39;t being a complete douche about it.<br />
<br />
During that time period, Kevin did other things. He walked around the apartment for a bit to get a better feel for the feet of the suit. He marveled at how he could stand flat on his feet or stand on the balls of his feet to achieve the same look for the suit, which looked like it was standing on a slight digitrade stance. Up until this point, he never understood why furries would fur suit, but he slowly began to realize that wearing the suit made him feel different, like he was a completely different person. It didn&#39;t occur to him that wearing a realistic cat themed costume was much more &quot;furry&quot; than the normal fur suit out on the market. He took off his gloves and the head portion of his costume to cook some dinner, some steak as fate would have it. For some reason he enjoyed the meat that night much better than anything else he had with it when he usually found vegetables to be more palatable. It was around 11 P.M. at this point. He rejoined Auron at the couch offering him a plate of steak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hows the marathon coming along?&quot; he asked cautious, afraid to set him off again.<br />
<br />
During his time, Auron had laid on the couch, feeling incredibly warm. But not so uncomfortable that he would take the suit off. Still, it bothered him he had to be dressed as a woman. And yet somehow it didn&#39;t quite bother him when he continued to wear it. It was like a second skin. As he stroked his bare chest flaps, admiring the texture on it, Kevin sat down with his gloves and mask off. He took the plate, removing his own gloves and mask, starting to eat the steak with a fork and a knife. He looked at Kevin, noticing something different. But he couldn&#39;t quite put his mind on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Auron said quietly as he watched the show between bites. &quot;I thought this anime would get better if I continued watching it. But it&#39;s kind of boring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Auron watched him eat his steak. There was something about him that he couldn&#39;t describe. Something that made him shudder. But then he just asked. &quot;So are you enjoying that suit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin nearly dropped his fork in surprise. He looked down and realized he was still wearing it, the soft fur on his belly was riddled with crumbs. Feeling a little self conscientious he rubbed the crumbs off of his suit feeling a little chagrined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yea... I guess I kind of do like it. The fur keeps me warm&quot; he said lamely. But still... he did not want to take it off for some reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; Auron said, leaning in closer to Kevin. He wasn&#39;t sure then, but he could swear he was purring. The two leaned into eachother, enjoying the odd warmth their bodies shared. A dull haze slowly descended over them both as their purrs lulled their minds into a deep relaxation. Kevin distantly realized he&#39;d grown hard...something he&#39;d normally be embarrassed about, but the relaxation consumed him and he brushed it off. It was fine. He was here with his best bro, comfortable, warm..... a murrrrrrrrrrr escaped his lips as his thoughts drifted.<br />
<br />
The rest of the evening was a dull blur.</p>
