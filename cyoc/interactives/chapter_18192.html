<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carrie hadn’t been to visit Jamie Brent for a while. She felt guilty about it. They’d been really good friends a few months ago, back when she’d started going out with Charlie. Then, the three of them had made a sort of exclusive group of friends and most of her friends had laughed at her for hanging out with such nerds. She was still with Charlie now, but it was envy she got from her friends these days.<br />
<br />
Carrie knew why she’d stopped coming round, and talking to Jamie. It was Charlie. “Why don’t you fuck him, you like him so much” he’d taunted cruelly “lick his ear and he’ll probably cream his pants”. In the end it just got too much to bear, and she started to see Jamie as Charlie, and the rest of the school, saw him, a pathetic annoying little nerd. Maybe Charlie resented him because he used to be a little like that himself. She can remember when they first went out – he had just started going to football practice in those days, and was on the reserve team, but he was still thought of by most of the school as that spotty little geek who sat at the front of the class with Jamie, and virtually peed himself if anyone else talked to him.<br />
<br />
It was hard to put her finger on what exactly had changed about him since then. Well, probably everything, late-puberty had certainly done Charlie some favours. Even in the last couple of months, his body was changing – every week the muscles were deeper and more impressive. And she could have sworn his penis hadn’t always been that large. The acne on his face had cleared up and developed so that he had a stronger brow and chin than the average Hollywood star. Not to mention soft sensitive lips and dignified nose. He was a killer on the football-pitch these days, and his confidence. Well that had just grown and grown so that he probably had too much of it now. He could say do or anything he liked, or anyone. And for the most part they let him because he was so gorgeous and magnificent.<br />
<br />
The ironic thing was that wasn’t even what had attracted Carrie in the first place. Back when he was still only a reserve, and hanging out with his nerd friends, he’d had a sense of humour and a sensitivity that made him great to talk to. He was like none of her boyfriends before, having mostly only ever dated guys from the first-team, of which he was now the star player. And now he didn’t really have any of his past sensitivity and humanity – but she still found herself going back to him again and again, because of who he was and what he looked like. She knew that he fucked other girls and talked to her like shit, but she couldn’t lose him – she was desperately attracted to him.<br />
<br />
So even when she found out that he’d spent Friday break tormenting Jamie Brent in the locker-room, with the rest of his muscle-head pals, she still forgave him and forgot. Even though she couldn’t believe he could be so callous, especially because Jamie had turned to her and Charlie when his parents died and they both knew how much he’d had to go through. They’d spent days together, at Jamie’s Aunties house looking after him and his cute little brother Tim. And even when Charlie had started to drift away, she’d still go round as often as possible – Tim was such an adorable little boy – until eventually he drove her away too.<br />
<br />
She felt so bad for her friend, that as soon as she woke up Saturday morning she resolved to go round there and talk to him about it. Charlie was at football practice anyway, so there would be no reason for him to know. As she rang the doorbell, she listened out for Timmy’s cartoons or hyperactive squeals that she’d grown used to having spent so much time with them. But for the most part it was all quiet, they must be out. She resolved to ring the doorbell once more, and return home. Charlie would be round that afternoon anyway, probably horny after a good game.<br />
<br />
**************************<br />
<br />
Jamie had given Timmy strict instructions not to open the door whilst he was out. He needed to go to some charity shops, to pick up some clothes for his big brother. Even though Timmy had told him there was no need, now he was a man with a great body he wanted to walk around naked, but Jamie was adamant that he was getting him some clothes. Timmy didn’t care anyway, it wasn’t like Jamie could make him wear anything. Timmy hadn’t paid any attention to his brother’s order not to open the door, but he was too dozy from whacking-off throughout the morning to get up. Timmy was just amazed at how good it felt, and how easy it was. Suddenly he couldn’t keep his mind off it, or any of the pretty ladies that were on the television. It was only after the bell had gone for a second time, and his curiosity got the better of him. As he swaggered downstairs, a new sensation hit him. He’d got annoyed before, but combined with the power and strength that was no swimming about in his blood and muscles, he actually felt like he could do something about it. Even if it was Jamie.<br />
<br />
He swung the door open with vigour, there wasn’t even anyone there. He shook his head in frustration, before he’d even shut the door he had reached inside his pants for another grasp of his big dick. Then suddenly a young female voice hit him<br />
<br />
”Er excuse me.”<br />
Timmy glanced up quickly. He recognised the girl stood before him. Carrie, she was a friend of Jamie’s and such fun! They would play in the garden, and she used to bathe him, and read him stories in bed. He hadn’t seen her in a while.<br />
“Hey Carrie”<br />
“Pardon me.”<br />
Timmy smiled at her warmly. She was great, he loved Carrie. She was always so pretty, and she used to tell him that when he was grown up they could get married. <br />
“Have we met?”<br />
”Yea, I’m Timmy!”<br />
She looked at him coldly. “No.” Then she looked down at his large fore-arm, stuffed down his crotch. “Do you mind?”<br />
Timmy wasn’t sure what she was objecting too, but he pulled his arm out anyway. “Do you want to came in? Jamie’s not here.”<br />
“Where is he? Who are you?”<br />
“I’m Timmy!” Timmy was confused at why his best-friend was acting so strangely. Perhaps it was because he looked so different. He’d thought he looked okay.<br />
“Do you go to Summer Bay? You’re not one of Charlie’s pals? This isn’t some kind of joke at his expense.”<br />
Timmy looked at her strangely. “No, I’m Jamie’s brother”<br />
He reached out his arm to her but she drew away. He looked straight at her, trying to understand what was wrong. But she didn’t seem to want to look back, she was more interested in looking at his body. Timmy could feel himself swell with pride as he watched her take it all in. She obviously thought he looked good too. <br />
“Come in Carrie.”<br />
She looked up at him, still confused but smiling too – her face a little red. Timmy smiled back warmly. Carrie was really pretty, and now he was taller it was like he could see her body better. The bulge in his pants started to stir.<br />
“You know, Jamie never told me had an older brother”<br />
<br />
<br />
Timmy had so stand aside, in the doorway to his house, to let Carrie pass through inside. Her small, svelte frame passing by his half-naked bulky one. Even the brush of her hand against his was enough to send his dick mad, pushing up against the fabric of his pants so that it touched Carrie’s thigh as she passed by. She smiled<br />
“Easy boy.” And looked up suggestively at the handsome male-model stood by, smiling wickedly. Timmy smiled back.<br />
<br />
Testosterone steamed through his blood. The presence of a beautiful young girl allowed him to feel more empowered and strong than ever before. As Carrie pushed past him, going into the living-room of the house, Timmy followed her in calmly. A swagger visible in his step, his chest swelling out and shoulders going back – emphasising the arrogance and ego of which he had now been rewarded. He didn’t even bother to shut his front door as he strutted into the room. Carrie watched him walk in eagerly, every muscle in his beautiful body moving. His handsome, beautiful face stretching to a cocky grin.<br />
<br />
As he got closer, not saying a word, his limited innocent vocabulary couldn’t muster any appropriate wording – he let Carrie do all the talking. <br />
“Do you want to….fuck?” she announced breathlessly.<br />
The cocky grin didn’t falter on Timmy’s face as he questioned the term – “Fuck?”<br />
The subservient, eager Carrie – trained through her months as Charlie’s girlfriend – bended to every single, sexual, will of her stud-like boyfriend, thought she understand Timmy’s language. If you didn’t want to fuck, but you were still horny, it meant you wanted something else. Almost without thinking she leant down, pulling his pants as she went and reaching for his massive, erect, cock.<br />
“It’s beautiful” she gasped.<br />
The arrogant smile only lengthened on Timmy’s otherwise innocent face. Caught between the innocence of his childlike mind, and a ravaging sexual consciousness, he didn’t understand what was about to happen. He knew that he wanted to get pleasure from her, get inside her, dominate her; but he didn’t know how. As she felt him take his magnificent dick into her tight beautiful mouth, panting with uninhibited sexual satisfaction, he understood a little better. <br />
<br />
It was over quickly but satisfyingly. As Carrie fell away from exhaustion, Timmy stood rooted to the spot, naked with his pants pulled from the floor. His head leant back in ecstasy, his eyes closed. When he’d been little, he’d spent hours asking Jamie what it was like to be ‘grown up’. It was his target, his aim; becoming more like his older brother himself the focus of his dreams. He looked at Jamie and saw all he though he’d need to know – you get to go places on your own, and you don’t get told what to do so much by other grown-ups. But Jamie had never told him any of this. Carrie had just been the pretty girl who would tuck him in at bed and read him stories. He never realised she’d do any of this for him.  <br />
<br />
As Carrie, lay there, on the floor of the Brent’s living room, she came to her senses. She was only supposed to be there for Jamie and little Timmy. She was supposed to be servicing her own boyfriend this afternoon. Had she gone mad? As she looked up at the beautiful man stood before her; a mixture of childlike innocence in his beautiful face and demeanour, only betrayed in the rock-hard magnificence of his body and the obvious uninhibited sexual-appetite, she understood what she’d done a little better; he was hotter than any of the guys in the football team, even Charlie. But all the same.<br />
<br />
He was starting to walk away, not even bothering to pick up his shorts which he left discarded on the floor. He was obviously in the habit of walking around naked, showing off his beautiful body, not caring who he’d offend or turn on. There was something about his arrogance, which was so very appealing. <br />
<br />
“So who are you?”<br />
He turned back to her. He didn’t really feel like talking any more, but he granted her a single-worded response “Timmy”, voiced in his deep, growling terms. He hadn’t like it at first, but he thought he was getting used to his voice. It was powerful, dominant and appealing, like everything else about him. The lowest voice he’d ever heard.<br />
She smiled at him “No, that was a joke. I mean, you’re obviously not him”<br />
He shrugged, he didn’t really care if she believed him or not. AS the front door started to swing open, he turned to that. His little brother walking in, laden with clothes from the charity shop and astonished with the sight that greeted him. Timmy smirked at his brother, he had so much to tell him.</p>
