<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milly breathed in the familiar scent of her parents&#39; house as she stepped through the door. &quot;No place like home,&quot; she said happily.<br />
<br />
Lenny walked in behind her, carrying their luggage. &quot;It is nice to be back,&quot; he said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have minded a few more days back at Mieni Atoll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you had stayed any longer, you would have become a beach rat,&quot; said Milly jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beach mouse,&quot; corrected Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we can&#39;t afford a beach house yet,&quot; said Milly, joking.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might not take as much time to afford one as you might think with our two jobs,&quot; said Lenny conversationally.<br />
<br />
Milly got a little more serious at that. &quot;Lenny, I&#39;m not really ready to leave my parents yet. I know I&#39;m considered an adult even if I&#39;m technically only four years old. The Animalian made an adult mentally and emotionally as well as physically, but I still feel a need to be near my parents,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everybody feels like that,&quot; said Lenny, &quot;Well, most everyone. I&#39;m not saying we have to move far away, but eventually this house is going to be crowded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Milly knew what he was referring to. Her parents had talked about having more kids, one they&#39;d be able to raise themselves without them skipping straight to adulthood. And Milly has been feeling a similar urge herself. She didn&#39;t know if she and Lenny will be having kids so soon, but it would fun if she and her mother can go through their pregnancies together. But that would mean they would need to move as this house wasn&#39;t big enough for two families of mice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can look into house-hunting later,&quot; said Milly, &quot;We just got back from our honeymoon.&quot; And even if it had been a really enjoyable honeymoon, it was still physically exhausting at times.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Mieni Atoll wasn&#39;t quite in full tourist season yet, but there have been people coming here for spring break. It would still be quiet enough for Milly and Lenny to enjoy their honeymoon without too much ruckus. That day, Milly was reading on her beach towel, wearing a pink bikini that no real four-year-old would be wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Milly, you need to get in the water,&quot; said Lenny, walking over and dripping with seawater.<br />
<br />
Milly looked at the water, which had a lot of waves that day. &quot;It looks a little too rough for me,&quot; said Milly, &quot;I mean, you&#39;re a big, muscular guy, but I&#39;d be battered senseless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess the waves are pretty big, aren&#39;t they?&quot; asked Lenny, looking back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a good day for that surf contest.&quot; Milly and Lenny looked over to see Ratlyne, one of the Piper rats that had moved here. She and her brothers were part of an entertainment group called the Jolly Pye-Rats, who dressed up in pirate costumes, tell pirate stories, and sang shanties. But Ratlyne wasn&#39;t dressed up like a pirate now. She was wearing a wetsuit and holding a surfboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;What surf contest?&quot; asked Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a surf contest at West Beach, that&#39;s where the good waves are,&quot; said Ratlyne, &quot;The waves are just right today. Maybe you should sign up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;ve never surfed before,&quot; said Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s an amateur contest,&quot; said Ratlyne, &quot;Anyone can sign up. It&#39;s just good fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that would make an interesting honeymoon memory,&quot; said Milly, &quot;Let&#39;s go check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
As promised, the waves were the right size for surfing on, though not so high that it would dangerous for non-pros. There were plenty of people out here to try surfing, some of them were also doing this for the first time. It didn&#39;t take a lot of cajoling to get Lenny to sign up for the contest. Of course, being such a large Animalian, he was going to need a longboard. There was a brief lesson so everyone would be able to surf. Fortunately, in addition to have a good sense of balance like most animals, mice have a keen sense of direction. That gave Lenny a good start of staying on the board and where he needed to be pointed.<br />
<br />
Milly also took a free lesson in surfing, but she left the actual contest up to Lenny. Milly wasn&#39;t exactly a weakling, but she wasn&#39;t as muscular as other Animalians, partly because she was a mouse. The waves might not actually batter her senseless, but she&#39;d get exhausted long before Lenny did. She was mostly on the beach, cheering her husband on. The bigger-than-average mouse was pretty good at surfing for a first-timer.<br />
<br />
Since it was an amateur contest, the scoring system mainly consisted of how many waves the surfers caught and how long they remained on their board. There were plenty of wipe outs, some a little more spectacular than others. Even Lenny didn&#39;t avoid fall into the water once or twice. But despite his size, he did manage to stay on the board pretty well. When the score was tallied up, Lenny ended up being the winner.<br />
<br />
Being an amateur contest, there was no big cash prize, but there was something very appreciated: a free reservation at Lover&#39;s Lagoon. Usually, one had to pay in advance to get some alone time. Lenny had been intending to book some time there with Milly and was very pleased they didn&#39;t have to wait.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see why this place is so popular,&quot; said Milly. The lagoon was kept in pristine conditions, no litter cluttering the area. The lagoon itself had crystal clear water and natural shelves along the edges. It was perfect for any couple who wanted to swim alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kinda wonder what would have happened if someone without a bondmate had won the contest,&quot; said Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;They could have probably traded it for something,&quot; said Milly, &quot;Or they might just pick someone up to go with them.&quot; Lenny gave her a look. &quot;C&#39;mon, I&#39;m experienced enough to know what a one-night stand is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s definitely not the case for us,&quot; said Lenny, holding Milly&#39;s hands, &quot;You&#39;re stuck with me for life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m really happy about that,&quot; said Milly. She had to stand up on tiptoes while Lenny leaned down so they could kiss. After a little bit, Milly pulled back and said, &quot;There are some benefits to being married to me, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot; asked Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unlimited access to these,&quot; said Milly before pulling off her bikini top, letting her breasts bounce free.<br />
<br />
Lenny raised his eyebrows and said, &quot;You don&#39;t waste time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we only have an hour and I want to make the most of it,&quot; said Milly as she shimmied out of her bikini bottom, allowing Lenny a very good look at her ass as she did so. &quot;Last one in is a cat&#39;s snack,&quot; said Milly before diving into the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no fair!&quot; called Lenny. He fumbled a bit with his swim trunks before he got them off and jumped in. He swam over to his wife who playfully splashed him. The two of them swam around the lagoon for a while before settling on one of the shelves. &quot;You know, you get benefits too,&quot; said Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such as?&quot; asked Milly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Access to the biggest rodent dick in the world,&quot; said Lenny as his dick started emerging from its sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure? Have you seen a capybara&#39;s dick?&quot; asked Milly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not comparing myself to a capybara,&quot; said Lenny flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll just have to take your word for it,&quot; said Milly. Thanks to the relative weightlessness of the water, it was easy for her to get in position. She moaned as she felt Lenny&#39;s girth entering her again. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d trade you for a capybara,&quot; she said huskily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Trade-ins not accepted,&quot; said Lenny before thrusting into his wife.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you already thinking about that again?&quot; asked Lenny.<br />
<br />
Milly snapped back to the present. &quot;Thinking about what?&quot; asked Milly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can smell your arousal,&quot; said Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, wanna go to my room and help me deal with it?&quot; asked Milly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can your bed hold me?&quot; asked Lenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do it on the floor if we have to,&quot; said Milly.<br />
<br />
Lenny chuckled and said, &quot;You really do have an insatiable sex drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you expect? I&#39;m a rodent,&quot; said Milly, &quot;So are you going to leave your poor wife hanging?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least let me put the luggage away first,&quot; said Lenny. Not that he objected to having sex with his lovely wife, but she tested even his durability sometimes.</p>
