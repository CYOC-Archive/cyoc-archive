<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... A huge lab coat.<br />
<br />
Neil glanced at the clock, and saw that it was almost time for him to head for the park, already. And so, he shrugged and got undressed. If he was to be at the park with a &quot;secret admirer&quot;, wearing a huge robe-shaped thing, he was going to be wearing as little as he could get away with underneath. Just a pair of underwear should be sufficient, he figured.<br />
<br />
As Neil pulled the huge lab coat on, he was again shocked at the size. He wasn't a short man, at about 190 cm, but the coat was long enough to have about 20 cm piled up on the ground while he was standing. And it was hugely wide, too - he could probably fit about 5 fat people inside it without a problem! He could probably wear one of the sleeves, and it would cover him decently! But then, it might be huge, but it was what the secret admirer wanted, so Neil did what he could to wear it without looking too out-of-place; tucking the bottom of it into the pockets, for instance.<br />
<br />
Neil then headed for the park - walking, as he usually did when he wanted to go places... with a body like his, why hide it inside a car?<br />
<br />
He passed by the house of his friend, Kane, and saw a strange black box sitting on his doorstep. It was odd, he'd have to ask Kane about it later.<br />
<br />
Neil walked into the park only to find it deserted. He walked over to the fountain, and sat down. The local town clock started to chime to indicate the time as 7 PM, and even as the first chime rang through the park, Neil began to feel dizzy.<br />
<br />
He turned toward the water of the fountain, and looked at himself as the third chime rang through the park. He definitely looked a little green around the gills, he thought. It wasn't until the final chime that he realised that it wasn't just his imagination - his face looked a lot greener than it should.<br />
<br />
He stood up and stumbled away from the fountain, feeling like he was going to throw up. As he fell to all-fours, he felt his underwear start to grow tight. He could feel a strange surge of strength run through his body, like the pump from a good workout multiplied by about ten times. He looked down at his hands, and was shocked to see they were not only greener than the grass around him, but almost three times the size they should have been.<br />
<br />
Neil was even more confused as his hands started to get further away from him, his arms burning as they grew longer and thicker, the sleeves of the lab coat rapidly filling out. But even worse, he felt the weight of his torso increase rapidly. Tilting his head down as far as he could, Neil gasped at the size of his now-green gut - it already filled about half the space of the lab coat! And he could only just make out the feet behind that huge gut, but they were also huge and green.<br />
<br />
Pushing with his arms, Neil quickly got himself standing upright... but something was definitely wrong - given the size of his gut and his arms, he should have been something like 3 metres tall... but his hands hung only inches from the ground. His legs had shrunk!<br />
<br />
Neil was near panic, when suddenly his head was engulfed in pain. He reached his oversized hands up to grab his head, and could feel his head growing rapidly. He moaned deeply and clenched his eyes shut as he felt his jaw and nose push forwards, and when he opened his eyes, not only could he see a snout of sorts, but his eyes felt strange. He felt a great pressure in his left eye, and his vision distorted.<br />
<br />
Moving over towards the fountain in a really awkward, lumbering gait, Neil looked at his face in the water. He looked really strange, with a couple of large teeth sticking out of the mouth at the end of his huge snout, and his eyes sticking out above his head like a crocodile's eyes. He looked down at his body, and found that the lab coat now fit &quot;perfectly&quot;, although his once trim and fit body was now huge and ungainly. He could feel the incredible strength of his new body, but also the incredible weight of it.<br />
<br />
Finally panic overtook him, and he started to try to run... but it was at that moment that he heard a loud cackle. Looking around rapidly, he saw an extremely ugly lady flying through the air on a broomstick. She cackled again, then spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I lost my minion to bird and bear,<br />
But this time, much better I'll fare.<br />
Your will is gone, your memories fade,<br />
A perfect minion I've made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil felt a great pressure inside his head. He grabbed at it as it seemed like a fire blazed through his memories, everything burning up except the woma.... the ashes of his old memories were replaced with just enough for him to know, her name was &quot;Grunty&quot;, and she was his mistress.<br />
<br />
Klungo shook his head as the last of the memories fell within his mind as ash, then beat his powerful fists against the ground and asked Grunty what was wanted of him. She gestured towards a huge hole in the ground, and then flew down into it. Klungo followed, lumbering along, occasionally beating his fists against the ground just to feel his own strength. He could vaguely remember that he had been human, but those memories were so faint that he dismissed them easily.<br />
<br />
It was once they were far inside the tunnel that Grunty told him what he was to do.</p>
