<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a small hexagonal window halfway up the side wall of the building.  Dachsund Jeff had noticed it and also noticed that the paint around it didn't completely connect its frame to the wood around the window.  It opened or closed somehow.  <br />
<br />
Jeff didn't understand why Tony was just returning to where he'd been at the edge of the woods when he'd left him.  He gestured for Tony to hit the ground in front of him and he did so.  Jeff and Jack scampered aboard their jackass friend, joining Eric and Jeff directed him over to the side of the building.  The area was poorly lit and not really visible from any other building.  There were some parking spaces just 30 feet away but all were empty.<br />
<br />
Tony could see what Jeff intended.  The window was halfway up the two story wall of the condo.  The living room had a two story high ceiling and the window was halfway up the wall bounding one side of it.  Jackass Tony walked up alongside the building so that his hooves were planted on the higher ground toward the rear of the building.  With the help of this elevation advantage, he was able to stretch his neck almost as high as the window.  He felt Jeff pulling himself up his mane and then scampering up on top of his head.  Next, Jeff walked to the end of Tony's nose and stood almost on Tony's nostrils reaching up to lean against and inspect the window.  To Jeff's chagrin, it opened out.  He couldn't push it in, but he also saw that it didn't sit very tightly against the frame behind it.  He scratched furiously with his little dachsund paws and succeeded in making it bounce back and forth a bit.  He scratched again and as it bounced out from the frame, bit the rounded wood edge as hard as he could.  Tony could see Jeff, down the end of his nose, pulling as hard as he could but getting nowhere.  The window wouldn't budge.  Tony gave a snap of his neck and pushed Jeff up enough to open his mouth and grab the lower half of Jeff's dachsund body in his mouth.  He could feel Jeff's tiny dachsund feet on his tongue.  Very slowly, he increased how hard he pulled.  For his part, Jeff focused all his strength on his jaws, trusting that his jackass friend wouldn't hurt him.  Tony just started to lean his neck back, getting some of his weight into the effort when, with only a tiny squeak, the hexagon swung open.  Tony could feel Jeff's tail wagging happily against the roof of his mouth. <br />
<br />
Tony stretched as far as he could now and opened his mouth.  He felt Jeff step up using his teeth as a jumping off point and saw Jeff squeeze through the 3 inch gap between the window and frame.  One after another, Jack and Eric followed.  Eric stopped on his way over his unwillingly equine friend and patted his nose between the eyes letting out a happy whimper.  Way to go, buddy!  In a moment, Eric was inside, too.  There was nothing more Tony could do, now.  Either he'd remain a jackass like this for good or, somehow, his budddies turned into dachsunds, would wrest control of the Chronivac from Emma Chase and restore him and themselves to their own bodies.<br />
<br />
Getting the window open had been difficult, but the prospect it presented the dachsunds wasn't easy.  Each had to pull himself inside and then jump down 7 feet, more than a dozen times their own heights, to a chair bounded on three sides by tables.  Jeff jumped out like a base jumper only without a parachute.  He hit the chair hard and bounced up two feet, landing quite comfortably on the coffee table in front of it.  For Jack and Eric, he jumped from the coffee table to the chair and patted the center of it, showing them where to jump then moved off to the side of the table.  In less than a minute all three dachsunds were inside the condo rubbing faces in congratulation as three tails wagged furiously.  They searched all through the living room for the computer with the Chronivac and emitter.  But they found nothing.  Damn, thought Jeff, that would've been the best.  I could've started the thing and changed us without any chance of waking her.  <br />
<br />
Next, with Eric and Jack waiting outside the doorway, Jeff crept into and through the ground level bedroom looking into the closet, under the bed and then, after a quick peek into the adjoing bathroom, he crept back out.  He faced his canine comrades, shook his head then glanced up the stairs.  She must have it with her in her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Climbing the stairs was no easy task for the three wiener dogs.  They had to rest at the top and catch their breaths.  Jeff went ahead to the doorway.  He held up a paw for Jack and Eric to stop and then went in alone.  His tiny buddies were starting to get nervous when he finally returned two minutes later.  Eric imitated a gesture of raising his eyebrows.  Well?  Jeff nodded energetically.  I saw it.  Jack and Eric barely kept from letting out barks of joy at the news.  They were so close!<br />
<br />
They were close to Emma just minutes later.  The computer started up with a single high chirp of tone.  Jeff waited frantically for the computer to boot up.  He knew just what he would do but could only grunt and quiver in place waiting for his opportunity.  Above him, Emma stirred.  The single tone registered, even in her slumbery haze as the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; she cried out and threw the covers aside.  Wearing just panties, she was suddenly attacked by a dachsund that jumped on her from the nightstand to her left.  It bit her on the neck and simply wouldn't let go though she slapped it several times.  Finally, she succeeded in prying the tiny dog loose and she cast it aside.  Immediately, another dachsund barked at her from the floor beside a laptop computer.  She jumped at it and grabbed the little beast.<br />
&quot;Ha!  Gotcha Jeff!&quot;  She inspected the lilliputian pup with a sly smile.  &quot;Nice try, boy&quot; she giggled practically spitting out the term.  But, where she expected a look of terror on the dog's face, she saw none.  And the dog's name tag said &quot;Jack&quot; not Jeff.  She tossed him aside and heard the sound of taping on a keyboard.  Now the terror was in her eyes.  She looked under the bed and past the edge of the comforter, saw a dachsund's head behind an identical laptop to the one at her feet.  She scrambled and jumped across her bed reaching for Jeff as she dove.  She grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and broke into another self congratulatory grin. <br />
&quot;Well well w-&quot; the sight of her pea green arm shut her up.  In short order, she shrank, her hair fell out and she grew a shell.  With her mind unaffected, her thoughts filled with rage at finding that she'd been turned into a small turtle.  She tried to make her way to the laptop, the right one this time.  But her perspective was no higher than that of the boy dachsunds and they happily romped around her and then pushed her over onto her back.  She shouted curses at them over and over but heard only small hissing sounds out of her turtle mouth.  <br />
<br />
Jeff exulted along with Jack and Eric but quickly went back to the keyboard.  He found the pattern for subject one, confirmed that it was him and enacted a restore function.  In 30 seconds, naked 16 year old boy Jeff was crouched in front of the laptop on the floor.  That was the bewildering sight that Emma's mother saw.  She came through the door saying &quot;Honey, are you all-&quot; and saw two dachsunds playfully spinning in circles a turtle stuck on its back.  She saw no sign of her daughter but there in front of her on the oppposite side of the bed was a naked teenage boy.  Penis.  She could not take her eyes off the naked boy and his penis.  The boy had stood up upon seeing her but then crouched back down on the other side of the bed.  She was about to demand an explanation of him when she felt all sense of reality go haywire.  The room seemed to grow.  She couldn't control her own limbs but she wasn't paralyzed, just unaccountably slow.  Then, the naked boy, now gigantic, the size of a small building picked her up, but was it her?  Green arms?  And why does my back feel like this?  He carried her down the stairs.  The penis right there, rubbery and somehow six feet long in front of her.  As the boy carried her into her room and threw the covers open she rued the decision to try acid that one time.  But why was the flashback even stronger than the initial effects?  He tossed her on her now illogically large bed and then blackness descended over her. <br />
<br />
When Tony saw Jeff's head and chest peak around the corner of the building and wave him over, he jumped in the air and kicked backward ecstatically with all his might in true jackass fashion.  He trotted to the arbor vitae enclosed area behind the unit and stepped onto the ground level porch as quietly as he could with his jackass awkwardness and mass.  Jeff rubbed his friend's muzzle at the open slider and led him inside then upstairs to Emma's bedroom where he saw dachsunds Jeff and Eric spinning a turtle stuck on its back first this way then that and yipping happily at each new revolution.  Tony immediately recognized it as Emma and let out an equine sort of laugh.  <br />
<br />
Jeff put the laptop up on the bed and knelt before it, tapping away rapidly at the keyboard.  In short order, Eric then Jack grew larger, lost his fur and tail and resumed human shape and their individual dimensions.  Ignoring their own nudity, they hugged each other and Jeff.<br />
<br />
At last, thought Tony, my turn.  But Jeff tapped away at the keyboard much longer for Jack or Eric and with an unchanging expression of concern.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, we've got a problem here, Tony&quot;</p>
