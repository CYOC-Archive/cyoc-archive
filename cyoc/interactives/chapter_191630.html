<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris finished training Clarence the right way. He never let the poor dumbo know that his search methods were just plain sexual harassment. It had been fun to fool around with a guy. Even if that guy was straight and didn’t necessarily know that that’s what Chris was doing with him.<br />
<br />
At the end of the night, Chris gave his retirement notice to the police chief, Ernie, Ernie asked why he wanted to retire, and Chris just told him that he wanted to explore more aspects of life. How could he explain that yesterday he was an average Joe with a girlfriend and today he wanted Ernie to bend him over his office desk and fuck his brains out?<br />
<br />
When Chris got home, he wanted nothing but to hop in the shower and wash the crusted cum off of his crotch. Instead, when he turned the light on he was met with his girlfriend. She was nude except for a large ribbon that tied her body up as a present, coming to a bow on top of her head.<br />
<br />
“Surprise!” Said Amy, “Happy one month anniversary!!”<br />
<br />
Chris sighed. The only this that had been good in their new relationship had been the sex. Now he wasn’t even physically attracted to her and it just made him realize that their personalities were never in sync to begin with.<br />
<br />
“What’s a’matter? You don’t like it?” Asked Amy.<br />
<br />
Chris couldn’t help but sigh again before talking, “Look, Amy, this really isn’t working out. I think we’re just not compatible.” She didn’t know the half of it.<br />
<br />
Scooping up her discarded clothes she stormed out and drove off slinging curses at Chris from her open car window. At least he didn’t have to pretend to be straight for her.<br />
<br />
The next two weeks went by slowly. Chris jerked off to gay porn every night. He wanted to download grinder or use craigslist to summon up a real man to have sex with, but he didn’t have the courage yet.<br />
<br />
The day of his last shift, another package arrived for Chris, identical to the one that had turned his life upside down two weeks ago. He frantically unwrapped it. Sure enough there was an identical gun with all of the same capabilities. He took the gun to his room and changed it to sexuality mode.<br />
<br />
Pointing the gun at himself, Chris fired the ‘straighter’ laser at himself until it wouldn’t go anymore. He looked at himself in the mirror. Where he’d just seen a dilfy middle aged man, he was back to seeing just a regular boring man. This is what it was like to be straight? He missed feeling attracted to himself and other men. He missed knowing how sexy he was because he himself wanted to bang himself.<br />
<br />
Chris made sure nobody was looking. He was in his own house so this was a paranoid thing to do. He was just ashamed of what he was about to do. The first time he had made himself gay with a gun like this it was an honest mistake. Now he was about to make himself gay by choice. He fired the ‘gayer’ laser until it cut off. Looking at his reflection again, it was like black and white had become color. There was that foxy man he’d gotten to know over the last couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
Chris suddenly had an idea of how to spend his last shift at his all male police office. He brought the gun with him to the office, and it remained hidden on his person since it was in the holster where his real gun was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Getting to the office, Chris stopped first at the video surveillance room. He ‘accidentally’ disconnected the mainframe. Now the cameras were displaying video feed, but not recording.<br />
<br />
Next it became Chris’ personal mission to homoerectify this police force. Maybe then they’d have more perspective and treat people better. Whenever nobody was looking he’d shoot the ‘gayer’ laser at a man until he was as gay as can be. He was only targeting men he was attracted to, but that was most of them. By the end of the shift, there were hardly any straight men in the office. Even the married police chief Ernie was a raging homosexual. Though he probably wouldn’t have the courage to admit it yet.<br />
<br />
Chris went into Ernie’s private office to negotiate changing his retirement benefits. “So you wanted me to increase your retirement fund?” Asked Ernie, wondering why Chris thought he could make such a bold request.<br />
<br />
“Yeah but first can you tell me if my underwear make my butt look big?” Asked Chris, shutting the blinds to Ernie’s office and pulling down his pants, revealing his shapely ass in his tighty.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Redfield, please! I am still your chief for tonight. And I’m a married man. A straight married man,” said Ernie, trying to resist temptation.<br />
<br />
“That’s all well and good, but what kind of underwear do you wear? I’ve always taken you for a boxers man but hoped you were a briefs man,” said Chris.<br />
<br />
“And why is that?” Asked Ernie, blushing, and hoping that his facial hair covered that fact. It didn’t, and the burly hairy man looked cute with his rosy cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Because you’ve got that nice big ass that I think would look good in something form-fitting,” said Chris boldly. He knew that Ernie must be getting turned with his new sexuality.<br />
<br />
To Chris’ surprise, Ernie stood up and pulled down his pants, revealing plain boxer shorts.<br />
<br />
“There, happy? Boxers. Now you won’t have to be distracted by my ‘big ass’,” said Ernie.<br />
<br />
“Well we can change that. I actually bought you these size large briefs. I’d love to see what you look like in them,” said Chris, giving the burly man the white underwear. <br />
<br />
Ernie wasn’t sure why he was going along with Chris. He just knew that he was more turned on than he had been since his teen years. His marriage had long lost its spark, and the rumors were around that his wife was cheating. He wanted to feel that passion again, and for whatever reason, Chris was making him feel that way.<br />
<br />
“Well turn around then so I can try them on,” said Ernie. Chris was surprised at how well this was turning out.<br />
<br />
Ernie let Chris know when he could look again. Chris took in the sight of his boss’s nice package in the briefs. Ernie did a slow turn so that Chris could also see the massive flesh globes of his ass which stretched the size large underwear to their limits.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you fill those out nicely. I wouldn’t mind being suffocated in that ass,” said Chris.<br />
<br />
“Chris! I am your commanding officer!” Said Ernie somewhat defensively.<br />
<br />
“Then ‘command’ me on all fours. I can see your dick is hard, we both want this,” said Chris.<br />
<br />
Finally the burly former straight man gave in to his lusts. He did command Chris on all fours and rubbed his underwear bulge on Chris’ ass until his own boner was hard enough to fuck Chris with.<br />
<br />
For an hour Ernie had his way with Chris’ butthole. Chris tried to keep his moaning to a minimum but he was struggling to do that because he was enjoying being ass-fucked for the first time. The whole office could hear their passionate fuck-making, and many of formerly straight men were pawing at their own boners imagining what was happening in that private office.<br />
<br />
Finally Ernie filled Chris’ guts with hot semen, making Chris cum too.<br />
<br />
“About that retirement pay increase; it’s yours,” said Ernie, one damn satisfied customer.</p>
