<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...Mia.  She looked like her head was going to explode.<br />
<br />
She ran right to me, got down on her knees in front of me, and begged, &quot;Please fuck me.&quot;  As much as I wanted to, I wasn't really in the mood right now.  She would just have to wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now, Mia,&quot; I said casually.  &quot;I'm too tired from fucking Lindsey, Trisha, and Katie.&quot;  I decided Lindsey might as well be here, too, and she walked through the door, still naked, of course, and sat down next to Trisha.  &quot;I'll make sure I fuck you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't wait!&quot; she exclaimed, and started to kiss me. <br />
<br />
I pushed her away.  &quot;No, Mia.  First you get your punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What punishment?&quot; she asked.  Once again I went through the whole story.  Jeez, I thought, I still had to do this two more times.  &quot;Oh, please don't hurt me, Joe,&quot; she said.  &quot;I didn't say anything about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you're right about that,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;None of you four did.  Claire and Erika, they're the ones that are in real trouble.  The whole problem is, I don't care for any of you belittling my friends.  That's why you've all been changed.&quot;  During my explanation of my powers, I had made them all realize how the others had been changed.  The reactions of Lindsey and Mia to Katie's condition were priceless.  Trisha seemed to laugh about it, and I have to say I couldn't blame her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, Mia, from what I've been told, you have quite the temper,&quot; I said.  &quot;Is that true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the hell do you care?&quot; she screamed.  Realizing what she had done, she glanced down at the floor and said, &quot;Yea, it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That Italian heritage, huh?&quot; I teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say that,&quot; she replied tersely.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid to say it's that little temper of yours that gave me my idea for your change,&quot; I said.  &quot;I think the rest of you girls will find it funny, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; she asked.  Unlike the other girls, she didn't show any kind of panic or fear.  She was courageous, and I had to admire that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone once told me having a bad temper can cause problems,&quot; I said, regurgitating something my mother still told me to this day.  &quot;So, I hope that my change of you can help you learn to keep it under control.  Otherwise,&quot; I grinned, &quot;it will lead to complications.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said nothing.  She waited for me to lay down the hammer.  The other girls held their breath in anticipation.  &quot;I wish that for each time you lose your temper at anything your breasts will grow slightly.  In addition I wish that one piece of clothing would disappear until you were totally naked.  I wish that your shirt and bra would not disappear, however, as they would wait for your growing breasts to rip through them.  Then, when you find yourself totally naked, you would have to come running to me and wish you back to normal.  There's no need for me to wish you to come running to me, as that should be a natural reaction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; her voice lost itself.  &quot;But other people...&quot;  Amazingly, she didn't seem to care about her breasts growing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes, the other people,&quot; I said, not losing my train of thought.  &quot;I wish that no one would find anything wrong with you suddenly growing bigger and losing your clothes.  I wish you wouldn't get in any trouble for it.  I do wish, however, that people would make fun of you for it, and tease you for it, but in a way that they laugh at your temper for causing you to lose your clothes.  But otherwise, I wish people would not react to it in any way.&quot;<br />
<br />
She swallowed hard.  She knew that she would have a rough time keeping her temper in check.  &quot;I'd say that's fair,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not really thinking that, are you?&quot; I asked, raising an eyebrow.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; she said, holding back her thoughts.  &quot;But I'm going to try and prevent my temper from taking control of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good attitude to have,&quot; I said.  &quot;And since you've been able to stay under control now, you can fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She squealed with glee as I wished her clothes off and she jumped into my lap.  It didn't take long for her to start riding my once more erect cock.  Suddenly it came to me why I was able to keep fucking them over and over again.  On Friday night, I had wished to maintain stamina with all of them as I 'infected' them.  The wish's effects had carried over, and would probably continue to do so.  <br />
<br />
I looked at the other girls and saw them all on the floor, arranged in a strange triangle, each of them performing and receiving oral sex.  It went Lindsey on Trisha, Trisha on Katie, and Katie on Lindsey.  They all seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I had a question to ask them when they were done.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I quickly brought Mia to orgasm.  &quot;Thank you for...for fucking me,&quot; she said.  She seemed embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be embarrassed,&quot; I said.  &quot;They're all like that, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded as she stood up.  I wished her clothes back on, since she needed them, and we waited for the other girls to finish.  Once they had, I said to them, &quot;Was it as good as me?&quot;  All of them shook their heads 'No.' <br />
<br />
&quot;It was fun and all---,&quot; Lindsey said.<br />
<br />
&quot;---But not as good as you,&quot; Trisha finished her thought.  She seemed eager to tell me that.  She also didn't look at me, but at the floor.  It was if she was ashamed of herself.  Probably because of my earlier threat.  But I had said 'other guys' then, not 'other girls.'  She really didn't have to worry.  Even so, the situation with her was getting interesting.  <br />
<br />
Lindsey and Katie sat back down, leaving a spot next to me for Trisha.  They knew she was supposed to be with me all the time, and they didn't want to upset me.  Trisha sat back down, but still didn't look at me.  She also kept some space between the two of us.  Before, she hadn't been able to not touch me in some way.  When Mia had entered the room, she had had a tight grip on my arm, practically nuzzling with me.  All of a sudden I missed that feeling.  So I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her into me.  I hoped she would get the impression I wasn't mad at her, which I was not.  She put her head on my shoulder and clutched my arm again.  I needed to have a talk with her, I thought.<br />
<br />
But for now, more pressing matters awaited.  &quot;Next?&quot; I said.  The door swung open.</p>
