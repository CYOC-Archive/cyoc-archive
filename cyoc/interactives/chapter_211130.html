<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The man comes to the decision of inserting you into a bigfoot, or yeti, or sasquatch female.The term are interchangeable. There is a young female that should be in the process of having a baby but she&#39;s a difficult one, this female. She&#39;s a young coquette who finds neither male in the zoo good enough for her. She shows signs of wanting babies but not the actual intercourse or male required in the process. Well, you being there will solve that problem. Besides, you are already female so the zoo employee, being also wizard, merely has to go and retrieve a transformation potion. He lets a few drops fall on to the embryo you’ve become and utters the correct words of magic. Success! You are now set to become a female bigfoot, looking like a cross between a chimp and a gorilla. Because your new mother is already quite young herself, you shall be short and slim, to ease you passage through the birth canal and make the pregnancy itself as easy as possible. The man puts you into a carefully labeled test tube and then into a freezer, ready to be implanted. You yourself are fully unaware of all of this, deeply sleeping as you are.<br />
<br />
The next time you are are aware of your surroundings, you are in a warm, most place. But you cannot move. Because you&#39;re too tired? It is because you are a foetus that has a lot of developing to do yet, but you don&#39;t know that yet. You feel you are in a place that is... fleshy. Yes, that is the word. Fleshy. You can hear dull sounds around you. A drum. No, not a drum. A heartbeat. Gurgles and far, far away, screeches and various unidentified other noises. Where are you? The last thing you recall ids the Fountain Of Youth. That much is clear. You drank too much and regressed past your point of birth. You were an embryo. Then that man picked you up and... And what happened? You cannot remember. But you were an embryo when he picked you up and did something to you, and now you&#39;re an embryo in this weird, fleshy environment. So unless you got reincarnated, which you don&#39;t believe in, or at any rate sincerely do not believe you can think that early in your new life or remember your memories of your past existence, well... The truth can be guessed at. That man reimplanted you into a woman. Which is good news. You&#39;ll live and grow up again, that&#39;s all. Better than dying for not respecting the rules, right? You do hope you&#39;ll keep your old memories. It sounds like you shall, considering you are aware at the moment. Aware, yes, but dead tired. You sink back into your deep sleep. You have a whole lot of growing up to do. And you&#39;re not even born yet! Your last conscious thought is your hope that your new mommy will be a sweet and kind one.<br />
<br />
You wake up once in a while, but doze back into your unconscious state right after. When you emerge from your deep dormancy for a longer stretch of time, you have no idea how much time has passed. Probably a lot because you have limbs you can move a bit. You use them clumsily and tentatively to feel around your new body. You do look human, for as much as you can judge. And you crotch has no telling bulge. So you&#39;re not a boy. You&#39;re still a girl. Good. Having your gender changed would have been fairly disturbing and hard to adjust to. You also touch a chord. A chord that suddenly releases something warm and filling into your belly. Your umbilical chord! That is what it is! And you get a real good fill. Your mother has a good appetite, at least. The food is healthy, organic and composed of fruits, veggies, and a little meat from the little that gets burped back into your throat from your tummy. She&#39;s very healthy-minded. The close-to-nature kind. You can feel she&#39;s active. She runs, moves ands eats lots of fresh foods. Though you wonder where she lives. You don&#39;t hear many voices, or rather, words. You hear shouts and screeches, grunts and moans, along with pants and other sorts. Odd, but at least you&#39;ll be in good health.<br />
<br />
You wake up more and more as you develop in consequence. The fleshy encasing is becoming too tight. You could move around and kick not so long ago, but now, it&#39;s just too small. Comparatively to others, you guess because you feel you can move more than other, bigger babies. There is space, just a little bit, but it&#39;s a lot comparing to other infants, you&#39;re sure. You never developed testicles, which is a a relief. You are indeed a girl for sure. You can now feel your body. Your new body because it feels strange. Very strange. Your toes are much longer than they were. Your legs are shorter than your arms. Your fingers are long too. Longer than they were. And is your face really that protruding? You&#39;re a lot skinnier than before, though. Almost delicate. That&#39;s the only bright side. But that body is so strange... Suddenly, you start doubting your new body is human to start with. Oh no... That would explain the lack of words but more animal grunts and utterances you&#39;ve been hearing for months... As well as the very unusual way your mother moves, jostling you around in the womb. Not at all like a normal upright stance. Her diet too. You feel miserable. Stressed. Worried. Very, very unhappy. No! You don&#39;t want to be reborn as an ape! It&#39;s too horrible! What had that man done? That&#39;s not what you&#39;re supposed to be! You&#39;re a human, not a monkey! That man swindled you! It&#39;s a setup! Moreover, and more worryingly so, the umbilical chord is not doing its job. Oh, it offers you the crucial food all right, but the love you send in your semi-unconscious state is never answered. You feel love and sweet sounds of it but you can feel it&#39;s not directed at you. What does it all mean? This is getting auspicious and does not bode well. The idea of being in the womb of a monkey is disgusting and disturbing to the last degree already. Ugh! But do you really want to get out? To see just the monkeys forming your family and living like them, let alone being filthy, ridiculous and ugly like them? Doomed to live a life of mating, sleeping, grooming for lice and rolling in the dirt? Ugh! And yet as bad as it is to be in the vagina of a monkey, the world outside might be even more vile.<br />
<br />
And one day it happens. You are woken up by a sensation that is very, very uncomfortable. You feel pressed. Muscles squeeze you. The walls of your prison of flesh are crushing you. Then, they relax to start again afterwards. And again. And again. You hear pants and panicked noises. Grunts. Shrieks. You understand what is happening. The birth. You&#39;re being born! You are being squeezed into the birth canal and there is nothing you can do to halt this. Slowly but surely, you are forced into a tight passage, made of flesh. Of muscles. You go more smoothly than during a human birth, you guess, but it&#39;s horrible nevertheless. You&#39;re being pressed. Squeezed. Forced out. You see a light in front of you, as you are pushed down yet you do not wish to reach it. Not the world outside! Not this world! Not as an ape! No! Not that! You&#39;re in the womb of a monkey already! It&#39;s revolting! Ugh! You&#39;ll emerge from the crotch of a monkey! It&#39;s simply vile, horrible and humiliating! <br />
And suddenly, something grabs you by the head. Like a giant pincer. It pulls you forward, a force incommensurably greater than you. Hey! Hey, it hurts! Stop this! And your head emerges into the world as you cry out. You&#39;re really between the legs of a female ape! Her crotch! The light that greets you is blinding but you see still by glimpses the hair of your mother&#39;s legs. The blood and bodily fluids of the birth too. Ugh! The hands that grabbed you are those of a zoo employer who makes the rest of your body get out of its former home and cuts the umbilical chord. He checks your vital signs and nods, satisfied. You still scream and your lungs hurt as they try to get used top their new life-long function. You can make out shapes. Shapes that are somewhat familiar to you. These apes are really big but they are not gorillas. They are the yetis of the zoo exhibits where that damn fountain was located. That man made you into a yeti and inserted you into a female! The jerk! He&#39;s condemned you to the life of a dumb ape! A dirty, disgusting female ape that will attract males with only one thought: sticking their simian penises into your monkey vagina! It&#39;s absolutely revolting and it&#39;s just the start! The employer then places you upon the chest of your mother. Her nipples are more or less free of hair. But the rest is not, though. Right next to her there is a little ape. An older sibling? You get to see more precisely the face of your new mother. The one you&#39;ll have one day. Grey fur and a muzzle, with brown eyes. Nothing worthy of human beauty standards. And as a newborn you must look a hundred times uglier! And right in front of your nose is a nipple, already leaking a clear drop of milk. Ugh! No way you&#39;re touching that! Let alone drink it with your lips! The overall smell is also rather foul. A mingling of dirty hair, bodily fluids, vegetation, animal smells and all kinds of other revolting things. But your hesitation prompts your mother to force your head roughly upon her nipple. Her breasts hurt, actually, even if you don&#39;t know it and she knows that you suckling is the fastest way to get rid of the pain. Your instincts kick in and you suckle. Your body wants what it wants and does not care about your human mind. But as you suckle and your belly rumble at getting this welcome nourishment, you accidentally bite the ape&#39;s nipple. She grunts and shrieks, pulling you off and leaving you in the warm hay, alone and dragging the older young ape with her.    <br />
<br />
The next few days don&#39;t go much better. You weren&#39;t wrong. Your new mother does not love you. She spends the barest time with you and she lets you suckle until you accidentally tug, bite, or she gets tired of it and leaves. You are revolted at this food but you need it to live! To survive! She offers her nipple to the older male young ape instead, who feeds eagerly. The other young is a male and the one she loves. As if she knows you&#39;re a human and not one of her kind. Your body screams for food and you scream in turn. You are left on your own and only other females comfort you a bit. The other yetis go about their tasks. You hate it but no one seems to care. You even come to wonder whether it would be better to die. <br />
Eventually, an employer of the zoo arrives to pick you up. Shortly afterwards, you feel being pressed delicately against a chest. A hairy, smelly chest. A bigfoot&#39;s chest but it&#39;s warm and strong arms embrace you in a gesture of protection. Then a teat appears and you suckle it with gusto. It&#39;s milk. Cow&#39;s milk. From a bottle. But it&#39;s less disturbing than your negligent mother&#39;s nipple. You even get another filling! And then the bigfoot settles with you upon its chest. He snoozes off and you do the same. Another bigfoot, smaller, lies down upon the bigger ape at your side and munches on some plants quietly. Everyone is peaceful and the regular breathing is quite soothing. Your breathing definitely getting slower and deeper, something that had not occurred before with the other bigfoots.  <br />
<br />
The next few days make you discover your new life. The two bigfoots are males and mimic the sexual act often but are very loving and gentle. Especially the biggest one. Surprisingly, he acts like a surrogate mother. He always makes sure your tummy is full of milk and that you sleep comfortably. They both live separately from the others. He is gentle and attentive to your needs. Not violent at all, apart to impress his mate. His mate that brings treats and tasty morsels that your surrogate &#39;mother&#39; makes you try out, just a little until you are weaned. <br />
All these gestures and behaviors are checked and monitored by the zoo employees. The wizard in charge of the bigfoots is pleased. It seems Marilyn, your mother, did not enjoy being pregnant or giving birth to a female at all. She prefers males, hence her adopting a young male as her son, whom himself is a transformed visitor. Luckily, there are two yetis that are males but are a stable couple too. They have reacted very well to adopting a baby of their own kind, especially as your life was getting in danger. He is impatient to see how it is going to turn out. Moreover, a same-sex yeti couple adopting is bound to draw in crowds of excited and curious visitors, thereby drawing more money in. More money or... subjects. The thought makes him smile. He does not suspect that you&#39;ve retained your human memories as much but he is prepared to act if he sees proof of it. In the meantime, he is glad of the experiment you were part of.</p>
