<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was two Weeks after Rosie and Stripey started living in Green Meadows, in the Goatbarn Hole. They now were known by people like Susie Squirrel, from the property next to Goatbarn Hole. They are still making themselves confortable on Goatbarn Hole, and are still receiving visits from all their friends. The people who came more in Goatbarn Hole is Don and Camille, Don still trying to Fall Down by all the ways possible:  <br />
<br />
&quot;Jumping in the air and opening the parachute, to discover a rock into it.&quot; said Camille, today dressed as Pippi Longstocking. &quot;That was the his more recent Fall Down. Crazy was he paid for it.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe how much should someone like Fall Down.&quot; said Rosie, as she baking a cake for tea-time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say me. In fact, he was listing and taking photos of how he was after the Fall Downs.&quot; said Camille. Don, Stripey, Hunny and Flappy were playing poker, after they setup WiFi on Goatbarn Hole.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Is true Flappy going to Green Meadows?&quot; said Camille.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. He found a cozy tree were he could live. You know Flappy's perm now. He was single and with no family in RW, so no one to cry out about this. He'll work as carrier in the Green Meadows Post Office.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And about you and Stripey? You were permed before Flappy. How could you be expecting so much for a work?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I was a attorney and Stripey an obstretician. Either professions needs more qualifying and has more red-paper than other professions, even in ToonWorld. And...&quot; said Rosie. <br />
<br />
&quot;We think this time as a new honeymoon: you know, so much happening and so on. We had changed almost everything in our lives we could. We need some time to adjust.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;But you look very well.&quot; said Camille.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We need a little more time.&quot; said Rosie &quot;We had talk about that and we concluded we should give time to time. We still have money for months of well-being.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;We talked about Fall Down: did you experiment something on this?&quot; said Camille  <br />
<br />
&quot;No... Stripey was a little uneasy with Fall Down after... Well... That event.&quot; said Rosie, blushing &quot;I, by myself, will be 100% with Stripey.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And you? How are you going about all that happens in this month or so?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;These days, I have... You know... Those days.&quot; said Rosie  <br />
<br />
&quot;Stripey told me. He said you locked yourself on a room, activated the stink protection and burst everything you could on stink.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I made more...&quot; said Rosie &quot;I was in shame to say Stripey I touched myself. And as I done this, I started to scrub my tail against my face to feel my stink almost I could.&quot; said Rosie, blushing very red.  <br />
<br />
&quot;My god!&quot; said Camille &quot;Naughty girl, you! Good thing you're discovering what turn you on. But Stripey said you were crying some time after.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after... Relieving myself, I remember that dead alley, and that riffraff.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Some secret desire?&quot; said Camille, smiling, when she saw Rosie crying. &quot;Sorry! Sorry! I didn't hurt your feelings.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't think on that riffraff with other feeling than disgust. He was disgusting, mean, evil... But... Stripey said me that this is because my first... Time of month. That my mind was going havoc!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, make senses.&quot; said Camille, patting her friend's headfur. &quot;I think Stripey is thinking the same I'm now: you were a human guy. You had passed with so much things, in so little time. Some of these things were things girls prays to never, ever have to stand. You mind surely is going bananas with all these things. Maybe these things will going away soon.&quot; she wrinkled his nose, when a bad smell hit it. &quot;Rosie, is your tail unknotted?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;No! I just unknot my tail in private with Stripey... OH MY GOD! THE CAKE!!&quot; she said, looking to the oven, were a black smoke was going out.  <br />
<br />
So...  &quot;Don't worry.&quot; said Don, as Rosie blushed, when she put on the table a english cake she taken from the dispenser. &quot;Camille told me you was fighting like a crazy nut to restore that cake.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don, Rosie was against wasting food even before being a toon.&quot; said Stripey.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And we heard some crying.&quot; said Flappy &quot;What happened?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;We had a girl-to-girl talk.&quot; said Camille &quot;And, no, Stripey, you count no more as a girl.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know that. I'm happy Rosie can lean on you. It'll be sad when you go back to RW.&quot; said Stripey  <br />
<br />
&quot;We know... And it'll be difficult to go back now.&quot; said Don &quot;The other times, we came and see things and Fall Down and know famous toons, from Tygra from Thundercats to Speedy Gonzales. But now... We found friends here in ToonWorld. You, Rosie, Flappy, Hunny, Geoff...&quot;  <br />
&quot;Our doors will always be open for your.&quot; said Rosie. &quot;Mi casa es su casa.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm also a little sad our vacation is going over soon. But, I'm happy now.&quot; said Camille. &quot;This is the first time we had real fun here. Before we just went tourist-baiting everywhere. Now we had known places like Green Meadows. We tried also go to Care-a-Lot. Don didn't like this much, but I though that was lovely.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a good place... But I don't know anyone could like to live there, except, maybe, Care Bears.&quot;  <br />
<br />
They laughed. When someone knocked the door.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Special Delivery. Stripey Skunk and her wife, Rosie Skunk.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; said Stripey.  <br />
<br />
A Stork with a postman uniform showned on the door when Stripey opened the door.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, sign here... And here... And there... Thank you sir.&quot; said the Stork giving two letters for Stripey.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's too soon for us to wait the Stork.&quot; said Stripey, giggling. He take the envelopes and looked at it. &quot;Cool! The Toon Medical Association and the Toon Attorney Association had responded our requests.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Stripey opened his envelope, read it hastily and shouted: &quot;YES! My request was accepted. I'll work as doctor. I'll just need to make a residency again here in Green Meadows, with Doctor Fox.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Then people looked to Rosie. She looked a little down, the letter on her hand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I was not that lucky... They didn't accepted my qualifications as attorney. They said the legalese is so much different between toon and human. They gave me some options: either go back to university to relearn Toon Law in Big City or go next Friday for a advisory session, part of the Toon Well Adjustment Program. Well, there's also a third option: being a homeowner...&quot; then Rosie started to cry.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Rosie, don't...&quot; said Hunny. &quot;These guys from TAA are a bunch of morons. When I gone to Bear Camp, one of the perms was a lawyer there, stayed as one here and he said they are morons. And you have the option of gone back to university.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;But they had gave me only the Big City University option... It would be tiresome and costly go there and back again from here to Big City.&quot; said Rosie.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; said Flappy.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you would go to the TWAP and learn your options.&quot; said Stripey, rationally. &quot;Then, you would think your options and choose the best one.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Rosie hugged Stripey, sobbing.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Stripey... Look I'm being a spoil-sport. You should be happy, as you'll still work as physician...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, Rosie. So much things so soon...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to raise kids... I know you like kids... I like it to... I want you to be a daddy... But... You know... I don't...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand. You don't want to live on my shoulders. But, remember, I'm the 'he' now. Everything gone wrong, I'll raise money for us both.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you... Even before we turned as toons, you're more rational than me... And I'm happy about you also...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, darling. I know... I want to help you. You need this more than me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; said Don &quot;Next Friday? Looks good: had you ever heard about the new Fiat Cinquecento Pole Position Stunts Show? Those guys, Tess and Dave Derett are really incredible. We could go there after Rosie's counseling.&quot;  <br />
<br />
And that was decided:  <br />
<br />
&quot;I expect everything could be okay.&quot; said Rosie, on Friday, when she and Stripey taken the train to Big City. They decided to sleep there, in the hotel they stayed before going to Green Meadows, as they didn't know how late the Stunts Show would be over. Stripey was naked, but Rosie put a peachy sundress, her knotted tail with a pretty red ribbon bow. They were greeted by their friends on train station.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You should go alone?&quot; Said Camille, now costumed as Rainbow Brite. <br />
<br />
&quot;The letter said I should be alone in the counseling room.&quot;  A stink detector checked either Stripey and Rosie, as they entered the TWAP building, who looked very official, even for toony standards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; they said, as they entered the TWAP lounge &quot;If you stay long on the counseling, maybe we'll fix something to eat. But we'll leave a message with the receptionist.&quot; Rosie kissed Stripey and went to the reception as Stripey and their friends sat on the lounge sofas.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a counseling meeting... Name's Rosie Skunk.&quot;, said Rosie, showing her ID. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; said the receptionist, hitting the computer keyboard. &quot;There... Rosie Skunk. Your meeting'll be in 5th floor, room 504. Counselor Macaw. And...&quot; said the receptionist, as she gave Rosie a Nametag. &quot;I need to say: the security guys aren't skunk friendly. Use this everywhere you go from here. There was some funny gossip everywhere, and people there was gone a little skunk paranoid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; said Rosie, clipping the Nametag on her left side. She passed through a glassed security post, where guards with gasmasks looked and smelled her, even lifting her tail to examinate her tail knot with a callous harshness, although not hurting her. She blushed very red.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Clear.&quot; said one of them, a liger &quot;Okay, miss: second elevator left.&quot;<br />
<br />
She saw so much people front the other elevator doors and just her on hers. She entered the elevator and noted that she was alone and the elevator looked had been AirFreshened recently. <br />
<br />
&quot;They had SDP'd the elevator!!&quot; thought Rosie, when the door opened. Again, another security post and, that time, a female chipmunk, but a no friends face one, had made the same check on Rosie. She made a sign for her partner, a squirrel who looked like a muscled-up version of Dale, from &quot;Chip &amp; Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, but a serious one, and he opened the glass door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about this. I'm skunk-friendly, but that's my job. And, believe me, skunk stink is our least worry these days.&quot; murmured the chipmunk, as Rosie passed by, nodding in comprehension. <br />
<br />
She went with the squirrel to room 504, when he knocked the door. The door opened by itself.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Flabs.&quot; said the man on it. Rosie saw he was a big Macaw on a green tweed. &quot;Sorry about all the inconvenience with security. We had received some threats from some bad guys involving skunks, and we can't take the chance. I'm Matt Macaw, and I'm a counselor for new toons. Well, I'd read all your profile, so we can jump the red-tape and do the real work. First, however, I need to know if you have problems with Fall Down. Believe me, I'm not joking: it's to see how you react about this and see if you permanent toonification was correct and completely conducted. I know ZipZap was conducted the transformation, and she's very good, but we can't take chances. You can choose, however, which way you want to Fall Down: you can Fall Down by shotgun shooting or eating TNT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try the shotgun.&quot; said Rosie, looking non-chalantly. She had Fell Down some times after her perming, so she knows she could not be hurt in process.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; He taked the shotgun from the wall, targeted Rosie, counted to 3 and shoot. She felt the bullets passing through her body but little more than that. Rosie knows what was expected from her next. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want to drink?  Water, juice, some cool drink...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Water.&quot; she taken the glass of water and drank it. So, she felt the water dripping from the shot's holes. Mr Macaw had nodded and made some annotations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good: looks you're okay with Fall Down. If you had anything other than what happened, maybe we should have problems. Now, I'll made some questions. Some are just red tape, but I need you to respond all of them as truly as possible. All responses will be confidential and everything will be used just for counseling ends.&quot; <br />
<br />
Rosie responded about everything very truly, including questions about stinking, SDP and stink detectors, and being female and skunk and etc... Mr. Macaw also checked everywhere her body and checked the tailknot.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Humm... Looks you had worked okay with your tailknot. Well, looks you're well-adapted, more than much other human-turned-skunks. Now, to business: as I saw, TAA didn't want you work as an attorney 'cause the differences between toon law and human law, okay? So we from TWAP had to evaluate some options for living for you. I think homeowner was one passed over your head naturally. We have another one: reading your curriculum, I saw good marks on English and Maths, also good rhetoric and a fondness for kids, as you was attorney for children in complicated divorces cases. This open a possible teacher career for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A teacher? Never thought on this, even as human.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? That should be second nature for you. I say what: what about a children teacher? Green Meadows will need one soon, as old miss Rosemary is retiring in a year. Maybe you could work with her in a residency and after, everything going okay, and your teaching license being approved, you could be able to take her place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds great!&quot; Said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you're okay with this, I have no complains. I'll send you everything needed ASAP. I want you starting in a month.&quot; said Mr Macaw. &quot;Well, think that's all. Ah, take this.&quot; He have her a pin with a skunk making a positive sign. &quot;This will ease your life with the security posts. Place it on your nametag. All this is yours after you going out from TWAP building. Think on this as a souvenir.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; said Rosie, going out the room, putting the pin on the nametag. The guards from the post give her pass more easily after seeing the pin on the nametag and indicated the common elevator. She went back to lobby, where the receptionist called her: <br />
<br />
&quot;Your husband and friends went to the cafeteria, as you're too long there. Ah, this is a coffee voucher. Looks you're tired and hungry.&quot; said the receptionist, passing the voucher for Rosie. &quot;Everything was well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More impossible.&quot; said Rosie.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Liked to know. Good luck for you.&quot; said the receptionist.  <br />
<br />
She went to the cafeteria, where everyone greeted her. She taken a coffee au lait and a pepperoni and cheese sandwich as lunch, as she told them everything.  &quot;A teacher?&quot; said Camille &quot;How lovely! And you agreed?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Looks like a real option for me, thinking now.&quot; said Camille  They finished their lunch, happy with Rosie's new life. Then they gone to the Pole Position show. They taken their tickets and programs and sat on her seats.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And now, for everyone here, the greatest, mind-blowing, bamboozling, breathtaking stunt show on ToonWorld: presented by Fiat Cinquecento, the one and only... POLE POSITION SHOW!!!&quot; said the presenter. And then, a beautiful woman entered on the race course, on a beautiful, old-fashioned custom car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Tess Derett, your hostess, and this is my brother Dan and our machines, Roadie and Wheels.&quot; said the beautiful woman, with raven black hair and eyes, dressed on a jumpsuit and with a helmet, presenting her brother, a blonde guy with blue eyes in a car with state-of-art lines. <br />
<br />
The show was really incredible. They have a incredible control on the cars, and the stunts was almost supernatural, as Dan and Tess drove all her way over the course. Rosie had gone bonkers: she still was a race fan, even turning female.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And now, take your tickets because that's BALLOT TIME. We put the ticket numbers on a ballot for two FIAT 500 Toon Series. One for the lucky one and one for a lucky friend of the lucky one. Wheels, run the ballot.&quot; said Tess. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Tess!&quot; said a computer voice, as a CG face shown on the big screen on the road. The numbers started to show very fat and slowing more and more. The ballot stopped in 7880. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rosie, Stripey, look your tickets!&quot; screamed Camille, showing their one: 7879. She was the last one buying before Stripey and Rosie. <br />
<br />
Rosie looked and saw the number: 7880! <br />
<br />
&quot;And we have a winner!&quot; said Tess, as the screen focused on Rosie and her friends. Rosie sent her hand to the sky, showing the ticket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, miss, came here.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She had gone and looked at Tess. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're...&quot; said Tess  <br />
<br />
&quot;Rosie Skunk from Green Meadows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this ticket is yours truly?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My husband bought it. He's the skunk there.&quot; the big screen focused Stripey. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're lucky.&quot; said Tess in three mic as she received from Tess the two keys. Tess then said by her ear: &quot;And smell good for a skunk. I saw your tall is knotted. Don't worry, no one on Pole Position has skunk prejudice.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we could call her as a special guest on our last show! Me and Dan will try the backward jump from a ramp over thirty Fiat Cinquecento lined up. Miss Skunk, you be on my passenger seat. This'll be in some instants as we're readying everything&quot;. <br />
<br />
Tess gone with Rosie and her car to a garage on the pitlane. <br />
<br />
&quot;She will stink all around, I see.&quot; said Roadie computer voice, over Wheels speaker.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're so undelicate, Roadie.&quot; said Wheels &quot;Although she is a skunk, she had knotted her tail. That locks the endpoint for the stink glands, so she can't stink, even if she want.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry.&quot; said Tess, presenting her with a black racer jumpsuit and a helmet. &quot;Safety first, so put this jumpsuit and helmet. There's a tail hole for your tail... If you need to unknot your tail I'll get out a little and...&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry.&quot; said Rosie, as she looked the tail hole. &quot;I'll pass my tail over there without unknot my tailknot.&quot; <br />
<br />
And it really happened: Rosie passed her tail over the hole with some disconfort, but without pain and without unknot the tail. She even smelled her tail to see if she was stinking, which she wasn't. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I think you're okay.&quot; said Tess, making a inspection on the jumpsuit. &quot;Sorry about this, but safety first. I believe you understand. This is not a common car driving, but a pro stunt show, and this implies risks. Come in!&quot; said, when she sat on the driver seat, Rosie on passenger sear. &quot;Wheels, safety belts.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Safety belt engaging. Are you okay, Miss Skunk?&quot; said Wheels. Rosie gone flabbergasted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry: Wheels is my computer assistant. He's old, but quite a gentlemen.&quot; said Tess  <br />
<br />
&quot;He's quite a rubbish bin, that is.&quot; said Roadie.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And that's Roadie, my brother computer assistant. He's sarcastic, but a good guy.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Okay. Thank you. Nice to meet you, Wheels, Roadie.&quot; said Rosie.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome!&quot; said Wheels as Tess went to the course, helped by the computer assistant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, a tip for boys and girls: don't try this at home. We're professionals, on a race track and with safety procedures if everything goes wrong. Don't try this on the roads. The roads are not race tracks.&quot; said Tess, a little stern. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dan, Roadie, ready?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I was born ready, sis.&quot; said Dan<br />
<br />
&quot;I was afraid of that.&quot; said Roadie  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wheels?&quot; said Tess.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready, Tess.&quot; said Wheels  <br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Skunk.&quot; said Tess. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready!&quot; said Rosie.  <br />
<br />
She pushed the gas throtle, and the tires screeched loudly. The speed was high as Tess passed by the obstacles. Rosie was going bananas: she's not a beautiful woman, but a really pro stunt driver! She drove really fast, but, more than fast, she drove really safe. In any moment, Rosie felt any fear. For some reason, Tess Derett inspired confidence on her, from the time she checked her jumpsuit and helmet, she put itself on Tess' hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now, the Grand Finale!&quot; said Tess, by a speaker to the public. &quot;Dan, ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready.&quot; said Dan<br />
<br />
&quot;And you, miss Skunk? Ready for action?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready!&quot; said Rosie<br />
<br />
&quot;Wheels, it's showtime!&quot; said Tess, pulling the gas throttle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm ready, Tess.&quot; said Wheels<br />
<br />
Rosie saw Tess giving the 180&deg; and going backwards to the ramp.<br />
<br />
&quot;All green, Tess.&quot; said Wheels<br />
<br />
&quot;And Roadie and Dan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also all green.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, before Rosie could think on these things... She felt the vibration as the car gone away from the ramp. She saw the cars lined up below her and saw Roadie and Dan going below them. And then... The striding of the car landing on the ramp. Then another 180&deg;, that on the ramp and the cars going to the finish line, lining up each other.<br />
<br />
Tess finished the breaking and said: &quot;How do you feeled it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was incredible!&quot; said Rosie &quot;It was so Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You had no words? I'll think this as a compliment.&quot; said Tess as she looked to the crowd and pushed the mic for her. &quot;Everyone, please a cheer up for your Fiat 500 Pole Position ballot winner and a daring lady, miss Rosie Skunk from Green Meadows.&quot; said Tess.<br />
<br />
After the show, Rosie and Stripey signed some papers and received their two new cars.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks luck showed you her face.&quot; said Camille, that was in the Rosie's bright yellow Fiat 500 with Don. Hunny and Flappy were with Stripey in his black new car. <br />
<br />
&quot;You and Stripey were right... I was going bananas 'cause so much thing happened so soon...&quot; said Rosie, driving, still on the racer jumpsuit. &quot;Maybe now I'll settle down myself on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry... By and by, ever was easily for Stripey than for you. You yourself said that paid a price to stay married. Do you believe that price paid what you had?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! Sure and even more! Carrie, Stripey... She... He... is the one I'll live forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Now, you have everything you could want. A husband, and a new career, and everything... Now, give time to time. You'll be soon okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two weeks after:<br />
<br />
&quot;So... You're miss Rosie Skunk. I'm Dora Rosemary.&quot; said the female dog. &quot;You're the teacher-in-training TWAP send me to be my assistant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dear! 'Ma'am' it so formal. Outside the classrooms you can call me just Dora. In class, Miss Rosemary works good enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Dora.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had read all the recommendations TWAP made about how training you. I have some books I want you to read about teaching children and so on. But the most time things will be hands-on. The kids are good, although have one or two a little exceedingly mischievous. Are you okay?&quot; said Dora.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; said Rosie.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Time to introduce you to the kids.&quot; said Dora, opening the door to the classroom. The class was full of kids, 8 to 10, from all types. &quot;Children... I have someone I want you know. This is miss Rosie Skunk and she'll be my assistant this year.&quot; said Dora, pointing Rosie, in a simple and a ribbon on the tailknot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, miss Skunk.&quot; said the children.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, everyone. As miss Rosemary said, my name is Rosie Skunk, and I'll be helping her... And you, after all. I expect to be friend with everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
&quot;I read your curriculum, Mr. Stripey Skunk. I'm Dr. Felix Fox.&quot; said the Dr. Fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you, Dr. Fox.&quot; said Stripey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Felix, everyone here calls me this. We aren't that formal here in Green Meadows. I read your curriculum and saw you was a obstretician... but had some formation on First Aid and Trauma. And had a good clinic background. I believe this could work. This so-called residency is just red paper, believe me. Well, enough said. Ready to start?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Felix.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok... Shelly, open the clinic. Time to work.&quot; said Felix to the receptionist</p>
