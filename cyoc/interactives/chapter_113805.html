<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sun broke through a small part in the heavy curtains, casting light on the two adults peacefully sleeping after a stressful night. Benton was nursing a hangover, and worrying about the unwelcome guests in town. <br />
<br />
Amanda woke first, hearing the sounds of her daughter’s rather noisy love making with her two mates. While she had learned to accept her daughter’s life choices, and even made peace with the fact that Frieda was bisexual, she still wasn’t thrilled to hear to the three horny teenagers at it when the sun was just coming up. <br />
<br />
*Sigh* “I guess we’ll have to soundproof her bedroom too. Or build them a separate room where they can do that in private. Eric and Spencer use their basements, maybe we could let Frieda convert the attic.” Amanda thought. <br />
<br />
While mulling her thoughts over, Benton began to wake up. His headache wasn’t as bad as it was last night, he was thankful for that much. First thing he planned on doing, after checking on his wife and daughter, was drinking two gallons of coffee and taking as many Aspirin as physically possible without killing himself. <br />
<br />
“Feeling any better?” Amanda asked, noticing her husband was awake.<br />
<br />
“Some. Breakfast? I think I’m finally starting to get the hang of this whole pancake thing.” Benton said. <br />
<br />
“I highly doubt that. Should I see if the kids are ready to eat?”<br />
<br />
“Give them a minute to finish. Unless you want to interrupt them. They’ll have to finish later, and I’d rather if they didn’t spend the entire day rutting.” Benton said.<br />
<br />
“What should they be doing?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Things teenagers do. Er, what do teenagers do?” Benton asked. <br />
<br />
“You’re kidding right?” Amanda choked back her laughter. <br />
<br />
“My entire life, I spent my weekends at country clubs and with my father’s business friends. Or studying, learning how stock markets work, that sort of thing. I haven’t a clue what today’s youth do for fun.” Benton admitted. He was out of touch, that much was obvious. But Amanda didn’t realize that he hadn’t even had a real childhood. Some part of her wondered if that was part of the reason why Benton had been so stiff and cranky for so long. <br />
<br />
“You go start on the disaster you’re going to call breakfast. I’ll check on the kids.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, give me some credit! I’m much better at this than I was a year ago.” Benton calls after Amanda. Wrapping a robe around her, Amanda walked down the hall. As she did, the moaning and growling from within Frieda’s room became louder and louder. Knowing it was pointless to knock, Amanda took a deep breath and opened the door. <br />
<br />
Frieda was busy massaging Spencer’s clit while Eric nailed her. Spencer darted her tongue in and out of Frieda’s slit, her wolfish tongue lapping up all the wetness that was pouring out of her lover’s snatch. Amanda no sooner walked in when Eric blew his load. Below, Frieda was happily drinking the spunk that leaked out of Spencer’s hungry pussy. All three weres cried out in pleasure, though Spencer was the only one who howled being part wolf. <br />
<br />
As Eric pulled out the stimulated spines along his shaft dragged against Spencer’s insides. Frieda purred as Spencer’s tongue left her own wet slit. Amanda cleared her throat and the ears of all three cum-drunk weres swiveled towards the direction of the sound. Frieda sat up upon seeing her mother, while Eric and Spencer were content to continue lie on the bed as they basked in the afterglow of their mutual orgasm. <br />
<br />
“Mom, how long have you been standing there?” Frieda asked. <br />
<br />
“Just a few minutes. I guess you three are having a good morning. I only came to see if you wanted breakfast.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely. I’m starving after all that work.” Eric said, sitting up, tail twitching in excitement.<br />
<br />
“Work? Wow, thanks Eric.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
“You know I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just that…”<br />
<br />
“Eric relax, I’m joking. Some things never change.” Spencer laughed, nudging her mate. Amanda left the three to clean themselves, and continue to tease Eric. She was just glad to see Eric was feeling better after the events of last night. Though it was rare to have so many weres in agreement, last night everyone was in agreement about one thing. Eric was a hero. Ironically enough no one was bothering to ask Spencer how she was doing, even though she’d killed someone last night too. <br />
<br />
“Has your mom been discharged from the hospital yet?” Frieda asked, wiping the fresh spunk from her fur with a towelette. <br />
<br />
“Let me check.” Spencer said before digging around in her discarded clothing for her phone. Once she found it, Spencer saw she already had two text messages from her dad. One confirming that he and her mother were going home, and another asking her to call him. <br />
<br />
“My dad wants me to call him, I wonder what’s up.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
“He probably just wants to check up on you. Lot of commotion last night.” Frieda said. Spencer shrugged, and stepped to the side to call her dad. <br />
<br />
“Hey Dad, is something wrong?” <br />
<br />
“No, everything’s ok. But your mother wants you to come home as soon as possible. What with everything that’s going on, and she’s going to be home alone with your baby bro, I’m guessing she wants the company. Motherly instincts and all. Grandpa Mike will be here too probably. Old man hasn’t left since Junior came.” Evan said. <br />
<br />
He’d been home for only fifteen or so minutes. Maggie and Mike were upstairs getting Evan Junior all settled into his new room. Evan took a moment to run downstairs for some breakfast when Spencer called. <br />
<br />
“Alright. Actually, do you mind if Eric comes over for a bit. I think you two should talk about what happened last night.” <br />
<br />
“He’s taking it hard I take it?” <br />
<br />
“That’s an understatement.” Spencer thought. <br />
<br />
Eric and Frieda, ready to go downstairs, watching Spencer finish her phone conversation. While they try not to listen in, they can’t help it. As weres, it’s all too easy for them to hear their mate’s conversation. Eric was interested in seeing Evan Junior, but also really wanted to talk to Evan. He was feeling better about last night, but still didn’t feel right about the idea of hunting, nevermind killing. <br />
<br />
“I take it you two heard that?” Spencer asked once she’d finished her conversation<br />
<br />
“Ya, sorry. Are you going to at least stay and see how Dad’s pancakes turned out?” Frieda asked.<br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t miss that for the world. And from what I heard, my mom and Grandpa Mike are busy fussing over Junior. So it’s not like I’m missing anything important.” Spencer said before de-furring. Her thick black coat disappeared in seconds, and with it the rest of her fursona. Frieda and Eric felt a little strange standing there while Spencer stood half their size. <br />
<br />
“What? Never seen a human girl before?” Spencer smirks. <br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Honey, you coming back upstairs? Or are we going to have to do this ourselves?” Maggie called from the bedroom. She was getting Evan Jr. settled into his crib, while Mike were busy putting together the baby monitor. And bursting into swearing fits as his frustration mounted. <br />
<br />
“God damn, I hate these things! Why can’t we just do things like in the old days?”<br />
<br />
“Look how your son turned out. Are you sure Evan didn’t fall off a bed at one point?” Maggie half joked. <br />
<br />
“Oh, Evan’s fine. Rod the one who probably got his head roughed up.” <br />
<br />
“I’m sure Rod’s turning in his grave as we speak.” Evan said, entering the room. <br />
<br />
“Where were you?” <br />
<br />
“Talking to Spencer. She’ll be coming home after she has breakfast with the Knights and Eric. Oh, and Eric’s going to be stopping by for a bit to talk to me.”<br />
<br />
“Is this about the man he killed last night?” Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
“Eric did what now?” Mike exclaimed, waking his grandson. Evan Jr. started crying for his mom, and immediately quieted down once he was in Maggie’s arms.<br />
<br />
“I’ll tell you later. And try not to have bursts like that while you’re in nursery.” Evan sighed. Mike was about to say something, but thought twice as he watched Maggie putting Junior back in his crib. Evan Jr. giggled, and played with the wolf plush Mike bought for him. The three adults, not wanting to disturb him while they had this conversation, went across the hall into Evan’s study to talk. Leaving the door open so they could keep an eye on him. <br />
<br />
“Now, what’s this about Eric killing a guy.” Mike demanded. <br />
<br />
Evan began recounting the events leading up to last night’s attack. From Leon Talbot’s son getting attacked, and then car-jacked, to the unexpected complication that arose from Freddie Parker’s goons running around town, his personal killer, and former Russian special forces operative, and the multiple witch hunts being conducted by the Were Council, the Talbots’ pride, and now Benton Knight. <br />
<br />
“I doze off for a few hours and everything goes to shit. So I take it that’s why there was a Were-Alert issued?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly. So don’t go getting yourself in trouble.” Evan said. <br />
<br />
“Tell that to your daughter and her boyfriend. If I were you I’d lock Spencer up until this blows over. Girl is a danger magnet.” Mike grumbled.<br />
<br />
“You are too. Besides, there’s no real danger unless you go out and look for it. The Parker gang is after Peter Talbot, not you lot.” <br />
<br />
“But they will be after you.” Maggie muttered. Her side comment went unheard by her husband, but not Mike. He could imagine what was going through his daughter-in-law’s mind. Evan survives multiple tours in Iraq, and then takes an equally dangerous job once he’s out of the service.<br />
<br />
“I’m more needed here than out with Evan, though I would love to sink my teeth into one of the bastards who tried to kill Spencer. Poor guy probably didn’t stand a chance, she’s her father’s daughter alright.” Mike thought. <br />
<br />
“I have to make a call to Daisuke, and then head to the Elder Council to talk to Tachibana. Spencer will be dropped off with Eric within the hour. And I don’t want to get a phone call about you dishing out street justice Dad.” Evan said. <br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll stand down. Don’t worry about me, just go nail those assholes before that Talbot does. I know how pissy lions can be when one of their own gets hurt. Really I’m amazed Parker’s kid isn’t dead already.” Mike commented. <br />
<br />
And on that note, Evan left wondering if Leon was indeed still plotting to take out the Parker’s and their “company” on his own. Evan wanted justice as much as the next guy, but taking things into your own paws was dangerous, in ways Leon probably didn’t realize. If a bunch of mobsters ended up dead in some small, off the map town, that was sure to generate media interest. The last thing Moon Lake needed were camera crews hovering around. <br />
<br />
“I just hope it won’t come to a fight. We don’t need more Talbots in the hospital.” Evan sighed, as he dialed Daisuke’s number.</p>
