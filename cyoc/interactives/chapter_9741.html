<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clutching the Medallion with wild wonderings flying in her thoughts Daphne walked quickly toward Freddie and the corral. Who could realy say what was pulsing through her young female mind as she headed toward Freddie. At any rate she was thinking and planning to use the Medallion and be, if not for one wonderous night a mare and mate to Freddie.<br />
<br />
Suddenly from the darkness and forest behind her came, &quot;D-A-P-H-N-E !&quot;<br />
<br />
Daphne whirled around to see who called her name. Panic began to set in as she wondered if someone from camp had seen her pick up the Medallion and knew her sensual intentions. Looking this way and that she saw nobody till a pair of square yellow pupils gleamed back at her from the dark forest floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-A-P-H-N-E !&quot;  came the call of her name once again as she froze there scared to death.<br />
<br />
The bright yellow eyes came closer and closer till with what little light prevailed the trail from a half moon above she saw a figure. Closer and closer it came till she recognized it as a dark brown hairy mountain goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goat's can't talk !&quot; said Daphne in her defense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon could, and I was Simon before the Medallion enhanced me into being this fine figure of a form!&quot; said the goat moving his mouth and lips ever so perfect of the King's English.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simon!&quot; said Daphne as she knelt down to greet her fellow student and long lost boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Stepping to within inches of her Simon again began to talk. &quot;I've been watching the camp tonight! I saw you and the others coming up the trail from below. Oh, but this afternoon was a hot one up here and my many nannies were also in verile heat too. I watched as that stupid Professor let Freddie change himself into that dun colored stallion. I would wish for him to remain that way more than a day!&quot; said Simon.<br />
<br />
Daphne smiled, &quot;He is a very, very fine male form! I can see before me one who might wish Freddie to join you and the others but why should he spend more than a day as a stallion?&quot; asked Daphne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gusto!&quot; replied Simon.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Daphne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once he's knowing the feel of being a stud and stallion he'll not wish or even want to return to human form, trust me! &quot; explained Simon. &quot;Oh, and the longer he remain as a stallion the more his instincts will prevail over his reasoning power and mind till all will breaks down and a true beastly animal he shall willinly become, like me!&quot; Simon said with a queer goaty grin.<br />
<br />
Daphne looked down at the Medallion she still cluthed in her fine formed hands. A look over her shoulder as Freddie whinnied over in the corral had Daphne stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's got one big one doesn't he!&quot; stated the real fact of Freddie standing, looking, and very erect of male sexual organ.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the taste!&quot; replied Daphne in a slow and thought provoking way.<br />
<br />
Daphne watched as her friend Freddie began an instinctive move of beating his meat stallion style. The more he had increased desire the more it flared larger and gave Daphne a longing to feel it inside of her.<br />
<br />
Simon saw Daphne's desire but had one of his own. Suddenly Daphne jumped as a cool moist muzzel reached up between her legs and nuzzeled into two tight buns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that!&quot; roared Daphne as she turned around.<br />
<br />
Simon was quick to move and with a slight bump to Daphne's shins she fell flat on her back. Simon stepped over her and with his wild yellow eyes he came nose to muzzel with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freddie can't talk, he can't love you as I once did! Come with me, wish yourself to join with me and the others as my favorite sweet nanny! Forget that big dickhead and learn the wild freedom it is to be with a true gang, my herd!&quot; beckoned Simon as Daphne's eye widened and thoughts of Freddie wained.<br />
<br />
Daphne lay there as Simon's long and hot reddish cock stretched forth from a hairy crude sheath. She lay there looking up and seeing the mire and slimed juices from dozens of past conquests still clinging to his belly hairs. She watched as his long red shaft stiffened to a rock hard spear shaped cock. As she reached for it with intent of socking it dry a noise happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the Hell off of her your dirty damn beast!&quot; came a loud and angry voice.<br />
<br />
Daphne turned her head away from the approaching red shaft to see a half drunk Professor Simmons giving the billy goat a solid swift kick in his guts.<br />
<br />
Simon jumped and rolled over on his side moaning with abdominal pain.<br />
<br />
Professor Simmons offered Daphne a hand and pulled her up to a standing position. Daphne shook head head as if somehow she'd slipped into a wierd trance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Professor!&quot; said Daphne.<br />
<br />
Simon looked up at the Professor as his learned leader began to curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damned are you to live and walk the Earth as this buck goat! You asked, wished, and cursed yourself to be something less than anyone would ever wish for you to be! I won't let you foul this girl in your evil and sex driven ways, she's better than that!&quot; grumbled the Professor as he kicked Simon's balls laying flat out on the damp ground.<br />
<br />
As Simon moaned ever more a happy Freddie whinnied over in the corral.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear young student, Daphne I might understand you being drawn to Freddie in his very male stallion self! Oh but my dear it would be ever so much a terrible lowing to be a nanny goat for this sex monster laying there! Please let me have the Medallion before you too make a awful mistake.&quot; asked the Professor.<br />
<br />
Slowly Daphne began to hand it over to the Professor just as Freddie whinnied again. Professor Simmons began to reach for it as Daphne looked him in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I loved Simon, we made love often and I liked being his! Since you and he went off to this place Freddie has brought me the feelings I'd lost. Now, tonight I watched and as you saw loved Freddie as he became such a larger than life desire, Oh how I want to feel him in me!&quot; said Daphne as she pulled the Medallion close to her breast and closed both eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish to be for Freddie his mate tonight and every night for the rest of our lives!&quot; she said in a fast and quick wishing wish.<br />
<br />
Freddie screamed his whinnies now as if frightened. The Professor stood there looking at Daphne as she opening her eyes saw him in a far different manner.<br />
<br />
A thrashing sound told of Simon's rushing off into the forest underbrush just as Dahpne began to understand what it was to be in a state of transformation.</p>
