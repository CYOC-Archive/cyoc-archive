<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;In miles per hour, what is the average speed of the male ejaculation?&quot; Nicky asked.<br />
<br />
A long pause began. No one seemed to know the answer. Finally, Brian buzzed in. &quot;I don&#39;t exactly know the answer, but last time this caused a lot of fighting when no one got it, so I&#39;m gonna guess 15 miles per hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo, sorry Brian. The correct answer would&#39;ve been anywhere between 28 and 31 miles per hour. Computer, I think it&#39;s time to twink!&quot; Nicky announced.<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s meter raised well past the third tick and went up three quarters of the way to the fourth as the familiar pink light brightened and enveloped him once more. Just as before, Eric shielded his eyes as Brian&#39;s changes took place. When the light faded, however, the bald man still looked the same. Had another mental change taken place, Eric wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Brian, how&#39;re you feeling?&quot; Nicky asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same I think,&quot; Brian stated, a confused look on his face. That face turned to horror, however, as he felt his body and groped his groin. The man then peaked into his pants and yelped. &quot;My dick! My dick&#39;s gotten smaller!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess 28 miles per hour might be the average, but you certainly won&#39;t get that,&quot; Nicky noted while the audience chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do this! I can&#39;t have sex with my girlfriend with this! It probably isn&#39;t even four inches!&quot; Brian protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s kinda the point hun,&quot; Nicky replied. Brian was about to protest, but Nicky stopped him. &quot;And actually, it&#39;s a little under 3. Now quit whining so we can get back to the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian was about to protest more but suddenly shyed away. Eric felt bad for the guy. With Micheal&#39;s less than noble tactics and the changes that had already taking place, the bald man was starting to lose it with just a couple of changes. Plus, with this new change there&#39;s no way he&#39;d keep his girl or get a new one. Eric knew what that was like (aside from the keeping the girl part) and didn&#39;t wish that on others. At least with his changes, Eric would probably stand a much better chance of landing a chick. The two had reverse fortunes.<br />
<br />
Nicky, however, seemed happy with Brian&#39;s newfound submissive nature and noted it. &quot;Looks like someone&#39;s a bit more submissive, too. That&#39;s hot! Anywho, next question! This one&#39;s much simpler. What is 450 divided by 18 times 2 plus 19?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric buzzed in before even thinking. Math was child&#39;s play for him. &quot;Umm, 69!&quot; Eric stated. &quot;Seriously? Of all the numbers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t make the questions, I just read them. Eric is correct though, which means he&#39;s in the lead with 100 dollars!&quot; stated Nicky, defending himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck? That&#39;s not fair! He probably works with numbers all the time!&quot; Micheal yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? Still, not my fault. Anyways, moving on. Which aquatic species is known to possess an above average intelligence for animals and has shown evidence of cooperation within its own species and with other animals, as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian buzzed in just before Micheal. &quot;A dolphin?&quot; he guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct! Brian finally has a penny!&quot; Nicky affirmed, leaving Micheal fuming. It brought joy to Eric to see Micheal so angry about not being good enough. &quot;Moving on, the ocean accounts for what percentage of the Earth&#39;s surf--&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Nicky had even finished the question, Micheal had already slapped the buzzer. Eric could see the thing visibly jiggle and redden slightly. Geez, he must&#39;ve barely heard the question.<br />
<br />
In fact, Micheal had heard so little of it, he didn&#39;t even know what had been asked. &quot;Uhh, water?&quot; he guessed.<br />
<br />
The audience chuckled, causing Micheal to fume even more. &quot;Water isn&#39;t a percentage Micheal. I&#39;m sorry, but the correct answer is 70%. And with that, computer, it&#39;s time to twink!&quot; Nicky yelled.<br />
<br />
Micheal&#39;s meter grew past the second tick and went halfway to the third as the pink light enveloped him once more. Eric smirked, glad the asshole got what he deserved as he closed his eyes and waited for the light to disappear. When it did, Eric noticed that man was much more tanned, and his new attire made that very apparent. After all, the brunette was left with considerably less clothes. In fact, all that was left was a jockstrap, red with a white plus sign square on his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Mikey, I didn&#39;t know how badly you wanted to beat Eric in the nudity contest,&quot; Nicky noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, it&#39;s still Micheal. And this is only for my job, bro,&quot; Micheal responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? That&#39;s the uniform lawyers wear? Maybe I should become one,&quot; Nicky suggested, drawing laughter from the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lawyer? Please, that was my old job. I&#39;m a lifeguard now. Sure, I&#39;m still smart enough to be the best lawyer in the world, but lifeguarding gets me much more time in the sun and swimming. Not to mention, the ladies love it,&quot; Micheal explained, winking to the camera. Eric had to admit he was slightly jealous. The new tan plus a killer body and a cool job? The brunette would be rolling in tits and pussy. Eric could only get a taste of that if won and he&#39;d have to do it without getting a negative change for the rest of the show.<br />
<br />
Nicky&#39;s voice snapped Eric out of his thoughts. &quot;I&#39;m sure they do. Alright, two more questions until the next physical challenge. Ivan Pavlov, noted physiologist, used a dog salivating at the sight of meat as an example of what response to an unconditioned stimulus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The unconditioned response,&quot; Eric yelled, after slamming the buzzer. Hey, he minored in psychology!<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct, Eric is now the proud owner of $1000,&quot; Nicky affirmed as the Eric&#39;s score rose to reflect that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Final question before the challenge! It is theorized that the mutation that caused blue eyes was caused somewhere between what range of years ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
The three contestants were silent on this one. Eric was happy to let everyone take the hit, just as he did before, until he looked at the audience around him. Where before everyone was looking at his bare chest that he so proudly displayed, now everyone&#39;s attention seemed to be on Micheal&#39;s flexing. Even without any changes, the brunette seemed obsessed with himself. The lack of attention made Eric feel awful; like he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms. Without thinking, he instinctively slapped the buzzer and the pink light put him in the spotlight once more. All eyes descended on the blonde, and he felt a rush of excitement as the attention returned to him. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t have any response, so he didn&#39;t know what to say, causing him to stumble in confusion. &quot;Uh, um... 2000 to 3000 years ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo, sorry honey. We were looking for 6000 to 10000 years ago. Computer, I think it&#39;s once again time to twink!&quot; Nicky announced.<br />
<br />
The pink light rapidly grew in intensity as Eric accepted his fate. To be fair, most of the changes weren&#39;t exactly bad for him. In general, his changes included more confidence and less weight. Not to mention, even if his answer was wrong, prior to his changes he couldn&#39;t even answer a question. Now, he was okay with being wrong in front of millions. Who could hate that?<br />
<br />
The familiar prickling feeling coursed through him once more. This time, however, it focused on specific areas. Above all else, Eric could especially feel the sensation in his brain, eyes, mouth and... ass? That couldn&#39;t be right though. At most this was his sixth change. Most of the time, the gay feelings came last. So what was happening?<br />
<br />
Just as quickly as the sensations started, they stopped, leaving Eric out in open for all to see. He couldn&#39;t seem to figure out what was different about him this time either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like Eric&#39;s gonna need a mirror to see one of his changes. Computer, put Eric up on the right scoreboard please,&quot; Nicky asked. The money board flipped to a massive shot of Eric standing at his podium, sending an even greater rush down his spine. As much as he loved the feeling, that isn&#39;t what left him shocked. The blonde moved his hands up to his eyes to confirm what he saw. Eric&#39;s previous plain, brown eyes had been replaced with sharp blue ones that seemed to sparkle even in the camera. Eric found himself getting lost in his own eyes as he gazed into its detail and wonder. In fact, based on the silence in the audience, many people probably began feeling the same way. It felt like hours but it must&#39;ve just been a minute before Eric saw Nicky snap out of it out of the corner of his eye and tell the computer to turn off the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you can just get lost in those eyes, can&#39;t you?&quot; Nicky noted with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s my other change? I can&#39;t tell,&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
Nicky looked at his screen for a moment. A mixture of shock, lust and happiness grew on his face as he read the change. &quot;I don&#39;t know honey. You tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky swung himself around his pole and jumped off in a graceful manner close to Eric. He then closed the distance with the blonde and gave him a naughty smirk before looking down and stretching his shorts forward.<br />
<br />
The first thing Eric noticed was that the green-haired host wasn&#39;t wearing any underwear, though honestly, his shorts were basically the same thing. The second thing Eric noticed, however, was what shocked him. The host had given him a clear view of his cock, which hairless, hard and huge. Eric should&#39;ve realized the twink was packing based on how well he filled out his shorts but the blonde wasn&#39;t really interested in looking there before. His reaction to the sight, however, could&#39;ve fooled anyone. The blonde&#39;s mouth immediately began salivating as did... another part of his body. He knew he could feel the prickling sensation especially in his ass and with good reason. Now, he was quite possibly one of the only people on the planet to have a self-lubricating ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like someone&#39;s having a pavlovian reaction to seeing a certain meat,&quot; Nicky teased. Eric immediately regretted answering the question incorrectly. At least the other way, his opponents would&#39;ve been similarly disadvantaged. He looked up at the scoreboards. On the one hand, he was leading in money with him at $1000, Micheal at $10 and Brian at the mere penny. On the other, he was clearly in the worst position on the other board, with Brian three quarters of the way to the fourth tick, Micheal at halfway to the third tick and himself at a little over the 6th. His meter was already starting to look like a dick, which meant he was close to losing himself. <br />
<br />
At this point, however, there was no going back from these changes. If he wanted to come out of this with anything, he had to win the next challenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, who&#39;s ready to get physical?&quot; Nicky asked.</p>
