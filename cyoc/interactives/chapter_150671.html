<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Marine Biology, correct?&quot; she asked. &quot;You&#39;re turning into a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edgar blinked. &quot;But aren&#39;t those female…&quot; His eyes widened. &quot;No, no!&quot;<br />
<br />
Another look of pity. &quot;We&#39;ll give you some time to process this,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Edgar drove back to his apartment off campus in a daze. He was turning into a mermaid? A female? It was one thing to turn into a monster and another to turn into a girl! He hadn&#39;t done a whole lot of research into the monster virus as it wasn&#39;t his area of expertise, but once his got back to his apartment, he sat down and did whatever research he could do. However he did not find much that was already public knowledge. <br />
<br />
Next he did some research on mermaids. He found that there were already several people who had transformed into mermaids. The main transformation basically involved their legs and lower body turning into that of a fish, which was your atypical mermaid. There were some other things like webbed hands and gills on either side of their bodies, just below the ribs. They also had slimy skin which was to help their skin stay moist when they were out of the water, which meant that they needed specialized clothing. <br />
<br />
He took a break from his research and took a deep breath. Well this was happening. He couldn&#39;t do anything but try to adapt.<br />
<br />
Over the next two weeks he prepared for his transformation, while doing his best to keep up with his studies. He first contacted another doctor to verify that he had the virus and when they confirmed it for him, he contacted his parents. They were supportive and offered to come down to the city to be there for him during the change, helping him move, but Edgar declined their offer. He knew that their work provided them little way on vacation. They seemed reluctant, but promised that their next chance they would come to visit him.<br />
<br />
The two weeks passed by quickly for Edgar. In that time he barely contacted any of his friends, and soon they confronted him, where he was forced to finally admit his condition. They were supportive and worried, but he assured them he would be fine. It would be a lie to say that he wasn&#39;t nervous, but he didn&#39;t want to worry anyone else. The university had already modified one of their own dorm rooms to house a mermaid and he had been able to assign one of his friends with a similar major to help him around the campus. He hadn&#39;t met the other monsters living in the specialized dorm, yet however, as he had just been too busy.<br />
<br />
Finally, it was time for the transformation to take place. He had already been changing slightly. Small breasts had grown on his chest, his overall body shape looked a little more feminine. His hair had changed color to a bright blue and had grown longer.<br />
<br />
To help with his change he was instructed by a specialist to sleep in his new dorm, which was mostly just a large and deep swimming pool. Edgar was given a floater to lay and sleep on, so that when he changed he could tip himself over and fall into the water. Edgar was a little skeptical but had no reason to doubt that line of thinking. It wasn&#39;t like he had a better idea.<br />
<br />
Sleeping on the floater was oddly relaxing for him, so he quickly fell into a dreamless sleep on it.<br />
<br />
He only awoke when he found that he couldn&#39;t breathe. <br />
<br />
Edgar flailed around in a blind panic, accidentally tipping the floater and causing him to fall into the water. He panicked a little more before discovering that he could actually breathe inside the water. He calmed down and twisted his body to look at himself.<br />
<br />
He, or rather she, was now a mermaid. She had large breasts hanging from her chest, that stood perky and firm and nipples now larger. She had an hourglass figure and skinner than when she was a he. His blue hair had now grown all the way to his waist, though it floated in a mess within the water and his ears had turned into sharp pointed blue find though she could still hear out of them. Her hands were now webbed and gills graced either side of her body.<br />
<br />
The biggest change had to  be her legs, as they just didn&#39;t exist anymore. All that remained of them was a long, blue, scaly fish tail. A small slit was just above where her skin transitioned into scales, which sje presumed was her vagina.</p>
