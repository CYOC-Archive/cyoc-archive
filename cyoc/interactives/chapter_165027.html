<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite the encroaching footsteps, Kyle didn&#39;t feel the need to grab a towel. He somewhat hoped whoever it was got a glimpse at his wet, naked body. Much to Kyle&#39;s surprise it was Charles, a student from his english class who everyone called Charlie, who came around the corner. Charles was always really outgoing and talkative despite, something you really liked about him. You also really liked how nice his ass looked in the tight cargo shorts he always wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I shower as well.&quot; Charles said.<br />
<br />
Kyle couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the chance to see Charles without anything on. Without hesitation he reply, &quot;Of course not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles face lit up with a huge smile an instantly went to work on his clothes. Lucky for Kyle he turned around when he took off his clothes so Charles couldn&#39;t see him staring. He started with taking his shirt off, he was a pretty lean guy and probably exercised regularly. Next he began taking those cargo pants off. He knows he wasn&#39;t the only teacher who took glances at his trunk throughout to day but he was happy that he was probably going to be the only one to see it with his clothes off. All that was left were his bright blue underwear. He slowly slid them off almost as if he knew Kyle was watching. Kyle couldn&#39;t get enough seeing how thick Charles&#39; ass was. He didn&#39;t realize he was getting a little hard at the sight of him. <br />
<br />
Charles turned around, finally nude and ready for a shower. Kyle quickly turned his head back and went back to showering so Charles wouldn&#39;t notice him staring. Charles got closer and closer, Kyle having to turn his big body to hide his hard member. <br />
<br />
Charles took the shower right next to Kyle almost as if he knew Charles literally had a hard on for him. Kyle was 5 inches taller than Charles, making him feel like a giant standing next to him. He turned on the water and began his shower. <br />
<br />
Charles broke the silence. &quot;Enjoying the view?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was taken aback by the question. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; He replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t think I didn&#39;t notice you enjoying yourself as I undressed. I made sure to keep it interesting for you.&quot; Charles said. <br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t know what to say, his cock was raging hard as Charles was teasing him. He knew Charles was playing with him and he was trying so hard not to look at him while he showered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m checking you out just as much.&quot; He said. &quot;I love it when you send glances my way during class.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle blushed and replied, &quot;It&#39;s hard not to when you have such a nice ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean this ass?&quot; Charles turned away from him, showing his beautiful cheeks.<br />
<br />
Kyle turned towards him, not carrying about showing how big his cock had gotten. Charles backed into him, putting the back of his head on Kyle&#39;s chest and looking up at him. He pushed his ass hard into Kyle&#39;s crotch, driving Kyle mad in the process. They were both soaking wet from the shower, Kyle was probably sweating on top of that. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for.&quot; Charles clearly had the same thing on his mind.<br />
<br />
Kyle wrapped his hands around Charles and began to slide them down his body. As he did this he was kissing his neck slowly. He slowly went down Charles&#39; belly and finally reached his cock. Kyle rubbed it slightly to make sure Charles was nice and throbbing. When his hands finally reached his ass, he squeezed it hard and began sliding his rock hard cock between Charles&#39; cheeks. <br />
<br />
Charles was breathy so heavily, &quot;Just fuck me already, I NEED you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle turned Charles&#39; body and shoved it up against the wall, thrusting his massive cock all the way into Charles. Charles yelped like a dog. Kyle&#39;s cock was being choked by Charles&#39; tight ass. He pulled back and which each thrust he had Charles yelping louder and louder. Kyle was already about to explode but he wanted to see if he could turn this race into a marathon. <br />
<br />
Charles was gasping for air as he was getting pound against the wall by Kyle&#39;s enormous body. Kyle&#39;s massive belly clapping his lower back with each thrust. Kyle had his hands pressed against the wall, thrusting with all the power he could muster. Charles was surprisingly taking it all<br />
<br />
Kyle was about ready to let it all out. He took his hands off the wall and took a hold of Charles&#39; hips, squeezing them almost as hard as he could . He thrusted one more time, shoving his massive member as far as he could into Charles&#39; thick ass. Finally he came, lifting Charles up off of his feet. Charles shuttered as nearly a pint of cum was released into his ass. Kyle was practically resting on Charles as he came back down from his high, both of them struggling to catch their breath. Kyle kiss Charles on the cheek, his cock still in his ass. <br />
<br />
Kyle said the first words as he slide his cock out of Charles&#39; ass, leaving cum dripping from both his cock and Charles. &quot;Not bad for your english teacher, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles turned around and reached up to Kyle, kissing him on the lips. Kyle pulled him in closer and held him tight as they kissed, keeping one hand on Charles ass. &quot;I&#39;m going to need a Round 2.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s dry off first and then I&#39;ll show you the time of your life.&quot; Kyle responded.<br />
<br />
Both Kyle and Charles cleaned up, washing away all of the cum they had just shared. Charles grabbed a towel and started to dry off, once he finished he threw the towel to Kyle and he did the same. They walked over to the bench by the lockers and both sat down to rest for a moment. Charles cuddled up while Kyle put his arm around him.</p>
