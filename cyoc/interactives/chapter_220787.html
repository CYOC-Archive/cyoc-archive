<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cleo messed around with the settings on the helmet with one hand, the other hand gripping one of her new breasts. She bit her lip and tried not to moan as she made changes intended for Dakota. Scarlett wasn’t stopping by today, something about having to get home early, but Dakota wouldn’t miss the chance to ogle Barbara for the world.<br />
<br />
“Or me…” Cleo said to herself, realizing that she’d also become an object of Dakota’s desires, licking her new lips at the revelation as new memories of catching Dakota sneaking glances at her now well rounded rear and magnificent mammaries. A bit of jealousy hit her, too, as she remembered Dakota still being more interested in Barbara. But she’d make Dakota see reason. She didn’t wanna change her too much, just make a few… slutty adjustments, and thankfully the helmet had settings just for that.<br />
<br />
Cleo snapped out of her daze for a second. Part of her was confused; she’d never liked women before, at least her old self didn’t, and now she was fantasizing about one of her friends, in fact jealous that one of her friends found her mom hotter than her. However, while Cleo could remember liking men as her old self and women as her new self… she only felt the attraction towards women now. She felt nothing towards men.<br />
<br />
“It’s not such a bad thing to give in to your desires… besides, this thing is made to make hot women anyway. I don’t see anything male on here except… mmmm… a girl with a dick sounds… interesting.” Cleo said to herself.<br />
<br />
While she felt nothing toward men, something about a girl with a dick was REALLY turning her on. She wen through her settings and decided to continue making her adjustments. She noticed the genitals sections said “Female/Male/Both” and switched it to both.<br />
<br />
Settings -<br />
Physical: D Cups, Bubble Butt<br />
Body Type: Base Form, slightly increased sexual attributes<br />
Age: Base Form<br />
Mental: Base Form, modified (sluttified - increased libido and lowered sexual inhibitions;) add: extreme attraction and dependency for Cleo.<br />
Awareness: Off<br />
Ethnicity: Base Form <br />
Personality: Keep default but add: Slutty Schoolgirl, Submissive, Slightly Shy. <br />
Sexuality: Lesbian<br />
Genitals: Both<br />
<br />
Once Cleo slid genitals to “both,” a new option appeared, reading “Genital Size: Male”<br />
<br />
Cleo looked over the options:<br />
Tiny (1 to 2 inches)<br />
Small (3 to 4 inches)<br />
Medium (5 to 7 inches)<br />
Large (8 to 10 inches)<br />
Very Large (11 to 13 inches)<br />
Huge (14 to 18 inches)<br />
Hyper (from 19 inches up)<br />
<br />
Cleo licked her lips again, thinking of the relatively simple slutty schoolgirl concept with a massive cock, the tip sticking out of the skirt…<br />
<br />
But decided against it and set it for Small, figuring it would fit Dakota’s body and new personality.<br />
<br />
Cleo then saw another option; testicle size. Licking her lips, she noticed it went from “Extra Small: around the size of raisins” to “Hyper: Watermelon sized or larger.” She decided to go on the smaller size, selecting the “Medium: gumball sized.”<br />
<br />
Cleo added one more option, the clothing one, which adjusted everything from the shirt to the pants to the more subtle things like makeup, hair, and accessories. She selected the default “Slutty Schoolgirl” option. Cleo noted that if she wanted to, she could get very specific with it, but decided against that for now.<br />
<br />
Cleo wanted to do so much more, but Dakota would be here any second. She decided to look over her list and save it:<br />
<br />
Settings -<br />
Physical: D Cups, Bubble Butt<br />
Body Type: Base Form, slightly increased sexual attributes<br />
Age: Base Form<br />
Mental: Base Form, modified (sluttified - increased libido and lowered sexual inhibitions;) add: extreme attraction and dependency for Cleo.<br />
Awareness: Off<br />
Ethnicity: Base Form <br />
Personality: Keep default but add: Slutty Schoolgirl, Submissive, Slightly Shy. <br />
Sexuality: Lesbian<br />
Genitals: Both<br />
Genital Size, Male: Small (3-4 inches)<br />
Testicle Size: Medium (Gumball Sized)<br />
Clothing: Slutty Schoolgirl<br />
<br />
Cleo hit save and pondered her options; was she really going to do this? Was she going to change her best friend?<br />
<br />
As soon as she started having second thoughts, though, she felt an even stronger desire. She HAD to use this helmet, why not on Dakota? It’s not like she’d realize it anyway. Besides, she did it to herself and she got this hot body, no big deal! <br />
<br />
Feeling much calmer, the sound of a door swinging open interrupting her thoughts. She quickly closed the door on the helmet, and sat with her hands crossed.<br />
<br />
“Hi Cleo! What’s up today? You look nice!” Dakota said, a big smile on her face. Cleo felt Dakota’s gaze drift toward her cleavage, and this made her even more aroused. Dakota sat in her usual chair, right in front of Cleo.<br />
<br />
Dakota was a relatively average looking 18 year old. She was thin but not rail thin; unlike Cleo’s old body had been, Dakota had a nice size pair of breasts, a solid B cup that she could make look much bigger with the right clothes. However, she was definitely top heavy, lacking any real hips; and while her rear was nothing to scoff at, it definitely wasn’t going to win anyone over at the strip club.<br />
<br />
Dakota was cute more than sexy. She had shoulder length blonde hair, big emerald eyes, a button nose, and thin lips that revealed a radiant smile. She had a nose ring as well as many piercings in her ears. She was wearing regular shorts, a pair of sneakers, and a t shirt. Cute, but definitely plain.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dakota, welcome back. And thanks, you look nice, too! Oh, before we start, I found this helmet, would you mind trying it on? It doesn’t quite fit my head.” Cleo said, innocently.<br />
<br />
“Sure! I need a helmet anyway. Wow, this one’s strange looking.” Dakota said, before slipping it on top of her head.<br />
<br />
Cleo watched in anticipation as Dakota went limp in her seat.<br />
<br />
Dakota’s chest grew as her clothes melted away, the formerly average breasts becoming big and round, sitting proudly on her frame. While Dakota’s body didn’t change too much, her hips widened ever so slightly as her ass became big and round, making her slightly more bottom heavy than top heavy.<br />
<br />
Dakota’s body became hairless; Cleo watched with excitement as even the smallest bit of stubble above her pussy disappeared. Just above her vagina, a small cock and balls grew in, becoming erect.<br />
<br />
Dakota’s face and hair were hidden by the helmet, but the rest of her changes were coming to an end. A pair of black dress shoes and knee high socks appeared on Dakota. A garter belt and pair of panties appeared next, followed by a push up bra and the rest of her slutty schoolgirl outfit: a blouse, blazer, and skirt.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Dakota seemed to come back to life. She pulled the helmet off, revealing her new face and hair; Dakota’s blonde hair was now much longer and tied into twin braids. Her lips were no longer obviously thin, in fact they were bigger than average and covered in pink lipgloss. She had much more noticeable makeup on in general, from her eyeshadow to her blush. Dakota’s face had gone from cute to sexy.<br />
<br />
“Miss Cleo, um… thank you, but it didn’t feel quite right on my head, so I… I’m going to put it down, if that’s quite alright.” Dakota said, blushing, avoiding eye contact and trying to make her glances at Cleo’s body less obvious. The overzealous confidence from before was completely gone.<br />
<br />
Cleo simply nodded. “This is so fucking hot!” Cleo thought to herself. She pretended to drop a pen, leaning over to grab it. While under the table, she saw Dakota’s tiny erection through her tight panties, Dakota giving a generous panty shot.<br />
<br />
“Oh man. This is gonna be fun.” Cleo thought to herself.</p>
