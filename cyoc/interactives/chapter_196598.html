<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about a toy store?&quot; Said Emily with a smile on her face, excited for all the possibilities they had now.<br />
<br />
&quot;A toy store? But why that one in specific, can&#39;t we just go to... something sport related instead? Just look at how hot that couple was after we took a picture of them in the Sport shop, we could look like that too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O Ricky, you are so short of views. We have already seen what that store can turn people into, where is the fun in that? A toy store has the potential to turn us into multiple things, we have no idea what we will end up being! Isn&#39;t that great?&quot; <br />
<br />
Despite the clear excitement in his girlfriend&#39;s voice and expression, Rick was having doubts about it. He had already agreed with Emily&#39;s idea, but now after hearing they were going to &#39;blend in&#39; in a toy store, he was pushed back once again. What if he ended up as a kid, or hell, even as a toy itself! However, even with this, he had to admit he understood Emily&#39;s view. He had already felt the camera on himself, and even if it definitely felt weird, it also felt exciting, in its own special way.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Ok, Emily, you win. Let&#39;s go, I want to see what we are going to turn into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s perfect! Let&#39;s go Ricky, I am sure you won&#39;t regret a thing!&quot; Said Emily with a smile as she excitedly walked to the nearest toy shop, Rick following her closely with a smile. Seeing Emily so happy about this was making Rick feel calm and easy, after all, Emily wouldn&#39;t be like that if this was dangerous, right?<br />
<br />
Once the couple were in front of the shop, all doubts about the change were gone, and Rick was as excited as his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you ready to change, Ricky?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then Ricki, say cheese!&quot;<br />
<br />
*FLASH*<br />
<br />
Even if Rick had his eyes closed and couldn&#39;t see anything, he could tell he was changed, very changed. In fact, the feelings his new body gave him were awfully similar to the first time he used the camera on himself, which could only mean one thing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I am a woman again.&quot; Said Rick as he opened his eyes and took a look at his new body, confirming his ideas. But this time, his body was notably older than before, more or less in his 40s. His red hair was now long and flowing, stopping in his back and well done, his newboobs were a C-Cup in size, his nails were expertly manicured and painted in a beautiful red tone. Of course, his appearance was now the only thing that changed, as his clothes were now fitting for his old body, consisting in a long blue skirt with floral patterns, a purple sweatshirt, a pair of white sneakers , with two pearl earrings in his ears and , of course, holding a purse on his right arm. Once Rick started to think about it, he looked really similar to his own mom. Could that mean..?<br />
<br />
&quot;Rick? Is that you!?&quot; Rick&#39;s train of thought was interrupted as he heard the voice of a small kid at his right, where Emily was before the picture was taken. However, as Rick looked at where Emily stood a couple of seconds ago, there now was a little boy, no older than 7 or 8 years old and with a reddish hair similar to Rick&#39;s one, but was much shorther, fitting for a boy his age. He was wearing a soccer uniform, and more importalt,y was holding the camera, confirming even more that this was Emily. The little boy that Emily was turned to was looking at Rick in awe. &quot;Rick, you are a woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you are not one to talk, haven&#39;t you looked at yourself? You are a kid! And a boy for that matter! A-and...&quot; Rick took a couple of seconds to breathe before continuing talking. &quot;...my son. Apparently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I am your son now!?&quot; Said Emily, shocked by hearing that, but still excited nonetheless.<br />
<br />
 While Emily was screaming and being amazed at the camera&#39;s powers, Rick noticed Emily&#39;s screams were making the other people at the store look at them with a concerned expression, which make Rick feel awkward, not to mention that could mess with their cameral-related fun, so he decided to calm Emily down for the moment. &quot;Uhm, ehm, honey...&quot; Said Rick, trying to use the same tone his mother used with him when he was a kid. &quot;I think you should relax a little, we are bothering the other people here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily laughed at Rick&#39;s attempt at acting like a mom, but she decided to follow him. &quot;O, sorry &#39;mom&#39;!&quot; Emily said with a small chuckle at the end. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing sweetie, just don&#39;t try to do that anymore.&quot; Rick was cringing a lot while doing this, but it&#39;s not like if he had any other choice, He was Emily&#39;s mom now after all. Once Emily was calmed down, Rick took his hand and walked outside of the store, thinking talking in a more open place would be the best choice. &quot;Uf, thank god that&#39;s over!&quot; Said Rick with relief as they exited the store and made sure they were alone and unnoticed.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Rick, you were a really good mom! You did very well back then.&quot; Said Emily while laughing, making her boyfriend roll his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, yea, of course I was. How about if we take some time to see who we are now before doing anything stupid, eh? I don&#39;t know about you, but I want to at least know my name.&quot; Realising they did know nothing of this new life, Emily agreed with Rick&#39;s idea to investigate a little. Luckily for them, Rick could find &quot;his&quot; phone in the purse he was carrying, and with it, he could find a lot of things about his new life.<br />
<br />
Apparently, his name was now Rebecca, and Emily was now named Emile. In this new reality, Rebecca had met Emily&#39;s father before his original wife, and they formed a family of their own, with Emily&#39;s old mother barely being a family friend now. The reason they were in the toy shop was because Rebecca wanted to give a gift to her son, who was doing very well at school. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, I don&#39;t really like that thing of being my own girlfriend&#39;s mother...&quot; Said Rick, thinking about his new life. &quot;And actually having a husband... ugh, this doesn&#39;t feel right at all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is also very weird for me, you know?&quot; Said Emily with a smile, enjoying all this a lot more than Rick. &quot;But this is also very cool, don&#39;t you think? Just think about everything we can do!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe you are right... But now that we have seen what we would turn into, what should we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about...&quot;</p>
