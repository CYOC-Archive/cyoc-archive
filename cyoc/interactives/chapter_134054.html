<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joey was paddling to shore as fast as his new feminine body could take him. He moved closer and closer to shore at Tucker and Tristin. Her body however was somehow gettinng distracted and and every so often she’d stop swimming to shore and stare aimlessly at the sky watching the clouds drift about. She’d then realize she’d drifted and start swimming again. These moments of drifting became more and more common however as she drifted away from shore and began to forget why she was drifting towards the shore. She forgot about Tristin and Tucker as well as her name being Jeoy. Soon she had no desire at all to swim to shore and just floated aimlessly in the ocean water lapped against her breasts pleasantly and she watched the clouds peacefully. It wasn’t until the loud noise of a seadoo filled the air and she glanced to the side as a loud machine roared up to her and blew water all over her face. The guy whipped around and she shook her face off to find a guy grinning at her, the type of guy who just stared at her breasts a flashed a great layer of white teeth at her. The same looks left his eyes that Tucker often gave to Tristan, whoever that was.<br />
<br />
“Wanna go for a ride babe?” The guy asked while revering his seadoo. Normally Joey would have screamed but that last splash of water had changed something now she liked his looks, she liked how rough and manly he was being. She just gave a smile and climbed onto the back of the vehicle riding so close to him that she pressed her breasts into his back and sitting as close as possible. The guy revelled it loudly and began to rush forward as sea spray splattered all over them and   The wind made Jennifer’s hair flutter behind her. She smiled feeling attraction fill her body to jerky guys that only liked her for her body. She was in a sphase where she liked guys like that. However the guy in front of her wasn’t going through the same changes. His hands suddenly let go of the Seadoo and he was launched backwards into Jennifer knocking them both off the vehicle as it shut off and stopped in the waves. Jennifer hit the water hard and the guy crashed into her before his entire body wrapped around her. His skin changed into new material and his head collapsed into his body. His body wrapped around her chest forming into a life jacket and suddenly inflated taking Jeffifer to the shore. She spat out water and swam towards her seadoo. She treaded water and quickly climbed aboard revving it loudly before taking off. Water sprayed into her face as her eyes drooped happily now filling with dreamy lust as she drove about. The machine roared through the water changing in colour and shape until it was clearly a rental. Jennifer drove it to shore and when she arrived at the place renting them out she handed the machine over to some stoned looking dude and took off the lifejacket revealing her beautiful black swimsuit to the crowded section of the beach. She strutted up to a locker room and collected a key from the front desk. She unlocked a mystery locker and drew out a beach bag and beach towel before walking out onto the sand again and laying her towel out and pulling sunscreen from her bag. She spread it all over her skin and got some random dude to do her back.<br />
<br />
Afterwards it was an afternoon of lying on the beach with sunglasses and a book that would be too bright to read if she hadn’t been wearing the sunglasses. The sun beat lovingly against her pale skin tanning it while she got ahead in her novel. It was nice in all actuality. Just a quiet afternoon. However her day at the beach wasn’t done. She got up as the evening wind and chill began to set in and walked into the change room to shower. She soaped up her hair and rinsed her body before drying off and slipping a gorgeous evening dress on and letting her hair fall gently around her face. She applied makeup to her complexion and smiled at her face before walking out of the changing room and putting her beach towel, book, and everything else into a large bag. She walked up the beach and though it took some time to find she eventually showed her things in the trunk of her car and walked back down the beach to one of the many shops opening up along the pier.<br />
<br />
Jennifer smiled as she gazed at the amusement park in the distance, at the very end of the pier strip. There was a multitude of things she could do but she decided to start with some dinner. A nice seafood bar sat overlooking the ocean and she sat down at it and ordered a beer while leaning on it. A cool wind gust past her as she sat on that bar stool watched a cook make her meal. The man chopped fish expertly before she she had a grilled lemon and herb encrusted piece of fish served atop a light bed of noodles. She ate it slowly and enjoyed the sea breeze while watching people show up. She made sure her dress was aligned perfectly so some cleavage was showing and though she got a number of looks no one took interest yet. She spent the rest of her meal eating slowly and drinking slower before she got up and walked further down the pier. She paused outside one of the nicer restaurants and stared at the couples inside. Well dressed for the warm evening and eating in pairs. All of them had stable relationships, men and women on a date outside the house. On one hand Jennifer loved the idea of meeting the type of man who would take her out and enjoy an evening with her but reality was different. She had dated about twenty guys now and each one had been the same. They hooked up and then just fucked up they broke up. As much as the life behind the glass appealed to her she knew exactly what type of guy she attracted and it didn’t take long for her to find it. She first spotted him in the swim shop where she was trying on bikinis and walking out of the change room to look at herself in the mirror. The guy had ragging and uncleaned hair and had a drifting smell of salt water coming off him, that lovely smell of the ocean that she was to die for. He unfortunately left and she stopped modelling bikinis for him figuring he had lost interest. She walked out with a new dress for nights like this and a new bikini to try out next weekend. It was then time for decisions. There was a lot of fun to be had to the pier amusement park but she could also get piss drink on the beach and dance. Both options appealed to her and she walked back to her car and deposited her purchase before walking back to the pier and deciding she wanted a drink so she walked towards the loud noise on the beach where several bars and tables had been set up. Jennifer let the music flood her ears and walked into the dance floor before she began to dance on the sand. Her hips swayed with the music, her waist bumped from side to side, and her feet moved expertly over the sand never bumping into one another. She must have danced for a while because when she came to it was a different song ending and a new one she didn’t like beginning. She walked off the floor and up to one of the bars where she picked up a drink and was headed to the floor again when she spotted that blond guy who smelled like the sea. She was feet away from him and to her surprise he turned towards her and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” he greeted her while walking up, “Were you that girl in the surf shop?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Jessica replied confidently.<br />
<br />
“You look really nice in bikinis,” The guy replied before Jennifer grinned at him and took a drink.<br />
<br />
“Well then you’ll be happy to know I’m wearing a bikini under this dress,” Jennifer teased.<br />
<br />
“Can I see it?” The guys asked.<br />
<br />
“Only if you impress me,” Jennifer replied with a smirk before she walked off.<br />
<br />
Jennifer wasn’t sure if he actually impressed her or not, the rest of the night was just a blur of dancing and drinks but she came to slowly dancing and swaying back and forth in the blonde guy’s arms. She also somehow knew his name was Conner. Whatever the case was she was happy and with liquor scented breath she leaned up and whispered, “Let’s go to my place...”<br />
<br />
They ended up in the back of a cab and Conner kept squeezing her thigh until they got to an apartment building and she used a key to temporarily unlock her door. She then entered the building, took the elevator with Conner and entered her apartment, a nice place rented thanks to her pay checks at work. Conner seemed surprised but Jennifer hardly cared as she led him to the bedroom and slipped her dress of revealing her bikini. Conner just grinned and tugged his own shirt and pants off until he was nude. She grabbed him and pushed him onto the bed before grabbing her bikini top and pressing it hard against her breasts. She raised them higher and higher while building up anticipation. Conner got harder and harder as she raised her breasts higher before suddenly she dumped them. They fell and bounced into place while she tossed her top onto the ground followed by her bottom. She leaned forward and undid a condom before popping it into her mouth and applying it to Conner’s dick with a quick blowjob. He moaned before she lifted her mouth and raised her privates until they kissed his. His penis plunged into her body and she moaned before positioning herself atop him and thrusting her body up and down while toying with her nipples. Conner thrust against her and she felt pleasure roar through her body. Heat and sweat built up on her skin while that pleasure kept building. She began to bend forward and squeeze her breasts in Conner’s face while she became hornier and hornier. Conner began to rub her waist and hips and pleasure rocked her body from every sexual point on her body, Conner definitely knew his stuff and she bit her lips and her eyes rolled back. His cock kept going though. She felt an orgasm rock her body but he didn’t let her recover. He just humped harder and harder and harder. She was building up a second orgasm and her tongue was hanging out. She kneaded her breasts, be massaged her hips, and she kept grinding as it built closer and closer to release. His dick seemed to get bigger, and finally he came into the condom and the feeling made her cum again and squeal in delight.</p>
