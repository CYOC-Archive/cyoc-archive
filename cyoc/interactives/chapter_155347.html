<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#9642;Week 9: Tuesday<br />
<br />
The day went smoothly. These last few days I&#39;m getting better walking, thanks to the shoes recommended by the doctor. At night I went to take a shower before bed, I was sweaty after running so much. After my transformation began, I began to enjoy running, something I didn&#39;t like to do before.<br />
<br />
During the shower I admired the progress of my transformation. My tail was already two feet long, as was my black fur that had covered my thighs, down to my knees, and also covered my belly, stopping just below my breasts.<br />
<br />
After the shower, the doorbell rang, and thinking it was Lara or Chris, I just opened the door and told them to come inside. But who came into the house were my parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Helen dear, are you ok? Why didn&#39;t you tell us you were becoming an animal?&quot; my mom asked and jumped up to hug me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I only knew about your condition today when I met Lara&#39;s mom at the market, she told me about her daughter&#39;s condition and about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother didn&#39;t leave me alone after the news and insisted we come here.&quot; My father said<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 9: Friday<br />
<br />
No big news. The only thing I noticed today is that my ears started to change too. <br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 10: Wednesday<br />
<br />
There was Chris, who like I did before, forgot to get dressed and came to school naked. Everyone could see that she was changing due to her little tail and the black fur that covered him and ran up her back. It was the first time I had seen Chris naked since the day we were going to do the medical exam together. I noticed her dick was bigger now, And the smooth skin underneath was already a little wrinkled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your scrotum formed.&quot;  I told her. Chris blushed with embarrassment just now realizing she was naked.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, Chris answered me in a low voice. &quot;Really, only I still don&#39;t have testicles.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Already at lunch, who had problems was Lara. She began to complain of severe pain in her udders, so we accompanied her to the ward.<br />
<br />
The nurse examined her and said she was not sick. The problem was that Lara had started to produce milk and her teats were too full, and that she had to be milked. So she asked Lara to be on all fours.<br />
<br />
After Lara was four on the floor, the nurse put a bowl under her and asked for me and Chris gets us. She positioned us one side of the lara and taught us to milk her. &quot;It&#39;s good for you to know, so don&#39;t help her while you have your hands.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
When we had just milked Lara, the nurse took the bowl with milk, filled four glasses with it, and gave it to us to drink. Lara&#39;s milk was really tasty.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s very good. Now I can tell my mom she no longer needs to buy milk at home.&quot; that&#39;s what Lara did after drinking a glass of her own milk.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 11: Monday<br />
<br />
After school, Lara and I went to my house. Unfortunately Chris&#39;s father had an accident and she went straight to her house. At home, I milked Lara. With her udders bigger than before, she was producing more milk, not to mention that her breasts also began to produce milk.<br />
<br />
Then we took a shower together before we went to my room because we had plans for Lara to sleep with me tonight.<br />
<br />
During the shower, we play a little with our changes. Lara marveled at how my fur now covered my breasts and reached up to my shoulders, complimenting how brilliant it was. she also stroked my tail, which was already two and a half feet long. My toes had already completely disappeared and left a thick dark layer in place.<br />
<br />
I also complimented her tits and said how good her milk was. Just as I watched her wagging her tail, already a foot and a half long and the mottled white and brown fur growing on her legs. Her feet were already becoming hooves too.<br />
<br />
So we went to each other to wash each other&#39;s hair. As I rubbed her head I felt some hard points and told her &quot;Your horns are already growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the shower I saw that I had a missed call from Chris on my cell phone. I called back to see what she wanted and she said her father&#39;s accident was not as serious as she imagined and he had just broken a finger.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 11: Saturday<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t believe this happened. It was good, concensual, but I never imagined we would get to that.<br />
<br />
Tonight we had a party at the college gym. During the party, Chris and I got lost from Lara after she joined some people interested in her udders.<br />
<br />
Since my body had already been covered mostly with fur, except for my feet, hands and head, I had completely abandoned my clothes and gone naked at the party. But while I was with Chris, I was looking at her face, which was already looking more feline and almost all black with fur, I realized that she was trying to disguise my breasts. Looking further down I found the tent formed on her skirt. She was clearly having an erection and it seems that I was the cause of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Chris, I didn&#39;t think it could turn you on like that.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
She blushed, apologized to me, and turned to leave. But I went faster and grabbed her arm. So I realized that my strength had increased, making it easy to hold her.<br />
<br />
I pulled her back and hugged her saying &quot;No need to be ashamed, I will not be angry with you because of it.&quot; (I was definitely even higher, before the transformation I had the same height as Chris, now her head was at my shoulders.) I held it even until she calm down, even though he could feel her hard dick to make my legs.<br />
<br />
After that we went to a classroom that would surely be empty at time, and, we had sex. I loved having her 9 inch cock cumming inside me.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 12: Friday<br />
<br />
Today was the most eventful day since I discovered I was transforming. Early in the morning, looking at myself in the mirror, I noticed that my hair was advancing towards my head and my face seemed to be longer. This was probably a sign that I could say goodbye to my human face.<br />
<br />
Later, when I arrived at college, I waited a while for Lara and Chris to arrive, but they didn&#39;t show up. Then I went to the bathroom before class, and there I found Chris fucking Lara. After Chris had come, Lara told me that she followed us as we left the Saturday party and peeped around while Chris fucked me.<br />
<br />
We left early to do our periodic medical checkups, where I saw that I had grown 4 inches more, I was startled when the scale showed I was weighing 120kg. I almost despaired until the doctor explained that everything was normal and that with the kind of horse I am becoming I would still gain another ton.<br />
<br />
And that night we first met infected people. There we meet people at various stages of transformation, and even make friends with a boy named Jack, who is apparently the same age as us. The stage of his wolf transformation was about the same as my horse transformation, though his head had already completely changed</p>
