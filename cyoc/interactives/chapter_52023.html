<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a smile Melissa asked, &quot;Do you remember what I said I could do to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; you said looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Melissa said. &quot;Now I need to get you out of those clothes.&quot; With that she quickly stripped you. She took you by the hand and led you out of your room.<br />
<br />
Presently you were led into the kitchen and there was still one of the guys in there. &quot;Why are we here Mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're here for your punishment,&quot; Melissa said licking her lips. She looked at the man and said, &quot;Get the special pan and oil.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man left and was back moments later with the biggest pan you ever saw. The guy took the lid off and Melissa picked you up and put you in it. With wide eyes you looked up at Melissa and simply asked, &quot;Mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is your punishment,&quot; Melissa said as she began pouring the oil over you.<br />
<br />
At first you thought Melissa was kidding about eating you as she rubbed the oil into every part of you. Finally it started to dawn on you that she might not be kidding. &quot;Please don't eat me Mommy,&quot; you tried to plead.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's your punishment,&quot; Melissa said as she continued to massage the oil into you.<br />
<br />
Suddenly very scared you tried to get out of the pan but Melissa seemed to expect this and secured your wrists to straps on the rack. Looking around you noticed the guy and said, &quot;Help me please. Please you have to help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He won't help you,&quot; Melissa said with a smile. &quot;He's only a golem after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; you asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;A golem,&quot; Melissa said rubbing more oil into you. &quot;They're created from inanimate objects. They have no will of their own. If you're a good girl after this I'll teach you how to create one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be able to create a golem?&quot; you asked puzzled forgetting your present predicament for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Melissa said still rubbing oil into you. &quot;As my daughter you're a witch too. But in order to use your power you need to learn the spells and potions. Now drinks this.&quot; She basically forced some of the oil down your throat. She smiled and said, &quot;Well now you're ready to be cooked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;COOKED,&quot; you screamed in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melissa said. &quot;You need to be cooked for me to eat you. Put her in.&quot; She directed this last to the golem.<br />
<br />
&quot;No you can't,&quot; you said trying to free your wrists. &quot;Mommy please. I don't want to be eaten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Should have thought of that before you misbehaved,&quot; Melissa said waving a finger at you.<br />
<br />
The golem came over with the lid and you were so scared that you froze. The golem put the lid over you and you were forced to lay back. You heard clasps locking the lid in place. You were now trapped and too late you unfroze. You started kicking and screaming. &quot;I DON WANNA DIE. I DON WANNA BE EATEN. PLEASE MOMMY. I'LL BE A GOOD GIRL.&quot; All of this was for nothing as you felt the pan lifted and carried someplace. You felt it being slid into someplace and what sounded like an oven door closing. You started crying as you felt the pan get warm. 'This is it,' you thought. 'She's going to eat me and there's nothing I can do.' After a few more seconds you felt the need to pee and seeing as how you weren't going to get out of this you just went ahead and peed. After a few minutes it grew hotter in the pan. You knew that you wouldn't survive long. You closed your eyes and focused the last sensations you would be feeling. You felt like ripping your hair out it was so hot but your wrists were still bound. The wire rack was searing into your flesh. Your skin was tightening up. Your breath was coming in sort gasps. At one point you felt a pressure move through your bowels and thinking nothing of it you took a dump. 'Maybe this will make it so she doesn't eat me,' you thought.<br />
<br />
You lost track of time. You were surprised when you felt the pan being moved. You heard the clasps being undone and then cool air hit your hot skin. &quot;Well you definitely browned nicely,&quot; Melissa said a smile in her voice. You felt a finger push on your belly and it caused tremendous pain. You wanted to cry out but your throat was so dry you could only make a hoarse whisper.&quot;Quite nicely indeed,&quot; she continued. &quot;You may be the best meal I've had yet. Make sure you record all this so she can watch it later. Now to eat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You figured it was Melissa who was releasing your wrists as you wondered how she could say you'd be able to watch it later. She was going to eat you. You were lifted up painfully. You were turned around and you felt lips on your butt. Slowly they slid over your butt and you found yourself being folded in half. This action caused parts of your skin in split open and fluid come spilling out. You heard a low moan come from Melissa and a tongue licking all over you. Your hands were stuffed into her mouth and received the same treatment. Your progress into her mouth was slow. Her tongue licking everywhere tasting your cooked flesh. Some more of your flesh split spilling more fluid. Soon your head and feet were getting the same treatment. Your head and feet entered her throat and soon your butt was entering her stomach. Now that your whole body had entered her throat your slide into her stomach was quick. You plopped into her stomach and the acid went to work on you. You felt movement and a few moments later a lot of movement caused the acid to splash all over you. The acid seeped into your body through any available opening breaking down your body into mush. This was a very painful process and you would have cried but your tears dried up in the oven. The movement you felt eventually stopped. There was a little movement every now and then. Finally your body broke down to mush and you continued on your journey. You could feel your body as it continued on it's journey into the small intestine. It was breaking down even further so that it was more of a liquid now than mush. You could tell that a lot of your body was being absorbed into Melissa's body. When most of your body had been absorbed you entered the large intestine where your body became more solid again. You sighed mentally as your journey was just about done. As you moved toward your final destination your body was compressed together. Eventually you ended up in the rectum. While the passage through the large intestine took a long time your stay in the rectum was short. Almost immediately you felt muscles pushing you and soon parts of you felt air then water. You knew you were in the toilet and at any moment you would be flushed. Instead though you felt like you were growing. You felt like your were a vague human form. Like a human inside a skin tight sack. You felt lines appear and soon your arms and legs had reformed. Soon your face followed. You knew that you were laying on your back and you quickly sat up and opened your eyes.<br />
<br />
You looked around and saw Melissa smiling at you. &quot;Welcome back,&quot; she said reaching for something. &quot;Let's get you cleaned up.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down and saw that you had a thin film of shit on you plus some small pieces of lettuce. &quot;What?&quot; you asked as Melissa started to wash you off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you I was going to eat you,&quot; Melissa said as she scrubbed your back. &quot;I cooked you, ate you, and then eliminated your remains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But how?&quot; you asked scarcely daring to believe this.<br />
<br />
&quot;The oil I rubbed in you and had you drink was the first part of it,&quot; Melissa said. &quot;It kept you conscious throughout the process. Eight hours after you were put in the oven I drank the second part of the potion enabling me to eat you like I did. Now four days later you were placed in the third part of the potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in the oven for eight hours?&quot; you asked stunned. You would have never guessed it was that long. &quot;And I was inside you for four days?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melissa said. &quot;Here watch the video.&quot; She pointed to a screen and you saw yourself be prepared and put in the oven. The scene jumped to when you were taken out and the time did confirm that it was eight hours later. Once the lid was removed steam came out and when Melissa picked you up you could see that you had indeed browned nicely like a turkey. You watched as she turned you around and started to eat you. Melissa didn't have anything on when she did and you were able to see your body travel down her throat and then her belly bulge out.<br />
<br />
By the time the video had finished Melissa had cleaned you up and said, &quot;Now that you're clean we need to get you dressed and then we'll go out to eat. Being eaten makes one hungry. Are you going to be a good girl this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; you said as Melissa took you out of the tub and dried you off. You did not want to go through that again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Melissa said.</p>
