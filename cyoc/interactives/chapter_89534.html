<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jamie wobbled the key into the statue with her mouth it began to wobble and shank. Soon the the stone began fading and returning to human flesh. After a minute Brad stood on the pedestal fully human and in a daze. &quot;Ugh whats going on?&quot; Brad groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brad you&#39;re heeeehaw okay!&quot;  Jamie exclaimed but Brad was still confused about what was happening.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ahh you talked? How is that possible?&quot; Brad was confused but after taking a quick look at the donkey and how it was wearing Jamie&#39;s clothes he was able to put two and two together. &quot;Jamie is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Jamie&#39;s ears twitched and went down &quot;It&#39;s a long heeeehaw story but first we got to get out of here&quot;. Jamie felt a weird feeling under her hooves like the ground was shaking. Jamie looked at the pedestal and it was shaking too. A piece of ceiling fell and landing next to Brad. &quot;This place is falling apart heeeehaw we need to get out of here.&quot; Jamie ran ahead and noticed Brad wasn&#39;t following her down the hallway. &quot;Brad come heeeehaw on!&quot; Jamie brayed. &quot;Once second&quot; Brad said as he was couched down at the pedestal, after a couple seconds Brad started running and joined her. The hallway continued collapsing, doors were being crushed as the ceiling feel. Soon the place was completely destroyed. Jamie noticed Brad was having and hard time keeping up and the destruction was slowing catching up to them. &quot;Brad jump on my heeehaw back!&quot; Brad jumped on and Jamie ran as fast as she could. They advanced down the hallway until they saw a bright light at the end. Jamie ran until it engulfed them.<br />
<br />
Jamie and Brad opened their eyes and found themselves back in Brad&#39;s living room, the game The Kingdom laid closed on the table. Jamie looked up at the clock, not a minute had past since they were in the game. &quot;We did it. We made it back heeehaw!&quot; Jamie said. &quot;But you&#39;re still a donkey!&quot; Brad replied.<br />
<br />
Jamie looked back and took a once over on her body. It was still covered in fur and her feet were still replace by hooves. Jamie swayed her tail back and forth while she looked at it. &quot;The important thing is that you&#39;re safe&quot; she smiled &quot;What were you doing back by the pedestal anyway?&quot;. Brad reached into his pocket and pulled out a key &quot; I could kind of hear things when I was stone. I knew you use these to save me so I thought I&#39;d grab one for you&quot;. Brad grab a bit of string and tried it into a necklace and put it around Jamie&#39;s neck, a tear rolled down her eye.<br />
<br />
That was so sweet of him Jamie thought, I wish it counted as redemption. &quot;Thank you Brad heeeehaw that was very sweet&quot;. Brad and Jamie waited &quot;If this doesn&#39;t work what are you going to do Jamie?&quot; Brad asked. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to heeeeehaw call animal control. Maybe they let me live in a zoo the rest of my life&quot;.<br />
<br />
Brad opened his eyes wide &quot;Jamie your ears!&quot;. &quot;Huh&quot; Jamie said in confusion. &quot;Your ears are different!&quot;. &quot;Quick Brad get the heeeeehaw mirror out of the front pocket of my overalls heeehaw!&quot; Brad did just that and opened in up for Jamie. Jamie still had the face of a donkey but her ears had taken on a human shape. They were still covered in fur but they looked much more human then before. &quot;The key must of heeeeeehaw worked Brad thank yo thank you&quot; Jamie was so happy.<br />
<br />
It took almost three hours for Jamie to return human, as she and Brad waited in the living room she went through  many changes. First Jamie&#39;s face sunk back in a returned to human proportions. Next her body slimmed down and took on a more human shape. Jamie decided to try to stand up on her two feet and realized she could again. Jamie laugh  as she walk on two feet, as her hooves clopped around on the floor. Next her hooves broke apart and returned to hands and feet. Jamie fur also started to recede back into her body and soon so was completely fur-less. Jaime was now almost fully human except for her tail. Jamie took a look back at it and saw that it was also fur-less but still had the red tassel on the end. &quot;Come on hurry up&quot; Jamie said as she gave it a faint wag, she come feel herself beginning to lose control of it.<br />
<br />
Jamie heard the door opening as Brads parents came in and greeted her. Oh no Jamie though as she back against the wall. I can&#39;t let them see my tail! Jamie made small talk with Brads parents as she felt her tail shrink and pull itself up into the torn hole in her overalls. Jamie was human once again. Jamie collected her things including the game and headed home.<br />
<br />
Jamie was so happy to be home. &quot;Wow that was quite a night&quot; Jamie said as she put The Kingdom on her bed questioning what she was going to do with the game now. Jamie undressed and headed to the washroom for a shower. On the way there she wondered what the game meant in the last note she received when it mentioned a &quot;reward&quot;. Jamie walked to the bathroom and was greeted by one last surprise when she looked in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be possible&quot; Jamie said as she looked over her turtle shell that had returned. Suddenly a monkey tail grew out of the back of her shell and her ears enlarge to mouse ears. &quot;Wait a sec&quot; Jamie said as she concentrated and felt herself return to fully human again. She looked at her hand and turn it into a hoof then a claw, then back to normal. &quot;I can control it&quot; Jamie looked to The Kingdom laying on her bed and began to question if she was going to throw it out after all.</p>
