<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake and Naomi were nearing the end of the movie where the hero and the librarian (the grand angle) had started to lick each others faces like dogs kissing. As they did, they rose in the air with their wings flapping and tails wagging happy they finally found peace within the city. &quot;Aw *yawn* look at them. They look so perfect for each other.&quot; Naomi said yawning as her mouth was wide open with her tongue rolling out making a little whine sound in the process. &quot;Getting tired? *Yawn*.&quot; Jake repeated the motion in his own yawn. At that point, Naomi was finally putting Jake&#39;s offer to use as she starts lying her head on Jake&#39;s knee and hugging his tail. Jake felt the ultra sensitive limb shudder at the touch of her paw padded hand. At that point, it was basically lights out for Naomi. Jake looked at her cuddling his tail. She looks so cute when she&#39;s asleep as most dogs are.<br />
<br />
Jake waited a while before he&#39;d slip away from Naomi&#39;s grasp. Jake had inspiration he needed to see through. His whole take with plunging humanity into canine hood all started with his tail. He still couldn&#39;t believe it. A tail. His own tail resting above his cheeks, moving by his command. It was all real, and to this moment still the most fun part of any changes he made so far. He wanted to make a special change dedicated to his tail. In fact, he wanted Naomi in on the excitement to despite her sleeping on his couch. Wit one swift movement, Jake felt Naomi letting his tail go as he slipped away from the couch to his computer.<br />
<br />
Jake looked up a way to alter previous changes and found out how. First, he had to specify only two individuals which would be himself and Naomi. Then he found a scale slider that could increase their tail size and length. Jake wasn&#39;t sure how big they&#39;d get so he opted for 40% increase. With that being done, Jake clicked change, but was interupted by a warning sign.<br />
<br />
&#39;Caution, scale change may lead to oversensitive reactions. Reality shift may not work as intended. Proceed with changes?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oversensitive reactions? May not work as intended? What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Jake looked at the warning multiple times trying to understand it. &quot;Ah, whatever. I&#39;m sure 40% can&#39;t be that extreme.&quot; Jake said quietly and hit the &#39;yes&#39; option. &#39;Changes commencing. Reality shift properties have been altered.&#39; Jake saw the message and got nervous. &quot;Properties changed? Does this mean she&#39;s going to notice? Is she going to realize that she&#39;s not really a d-&quot; Jake&#39;s inner rambling was interupted by pressure build up in his spine. However, compared to when he first grew his tail, this was much heavier. &quot;Ohh... Maybe this was a bit much.&quot; He says rubbing the base of his tail as it stiffened up.<br />
<br />
Naomi was sleeping peacefully until she felt pressure around her spinal cord. It was as if someone was actively tugging at her tail. Thinking it was probably Jake, she was ready to give him a good smack upside his snout. &quot;Jake... If you wanted to wake me up...&quot; She says while snarling. &quot;You could probably do without- arf?&quot; The snarling converted into a confused bark as Jake was no longer on the sofa with her. She looked back to see nobody behind her, but felt her tail like it was being yanked. &quot;I don&#39;t like this... Did I pull a muscle or- *Whine*!&quot; She made a whiny noise as she closed her eyes to the pressure her tail was receiving as it was starting to grow longer. <br />
<br />
Jake knelt down to his knees using his desk chair as support as his tail started to inch forward every second. Not only that, but the overall thickness from inside his tail also seemed to be growing. The whole feeling had Jake panting as his tongue lay flat on the seat of his chair. &quot;Heh... Was this the oversensitive reaction it meant? *ARF*&quot; Jake felt a surge as his tail lengthened and thickened massively.<br />
<br />
As weird as it was too her, Naomi was starting to enjoy the strange sensation. After the initial shock from the growth spurt in her tail, she couldn&#39;t hold back the emotions within and it started to wag. &quot;Hah... It&#39;s... So big... Beautiful...&quot; Naomi was overwhelmed by the feeling of the fur in her tail thickening all around it. It was so long that the black fur was tickling her back. She couldn&#39;t take it. She needed to hold it. She reached behind herself and pulled her giant tail over her left side to in curl and cuddle.<br />
<br />
With Jake now on the floor pulling his tail from between his legs, he stroked the soft, smooth fur that gave him shivers through his spine. Jake stuffed his face in the fur making all sorts of yips and barks of pleasure. Getting aroused, he lets it go as it swings back through his legs and curls up behind him as it used to be.<br />
<br />
The growth of both Jake and Naomi&#39;s tails were reaching the 40% up scale that Jake set, and with the few final inches of growth, the two couldn&#39;t hold it in any longer. &quot;AAWWOOOHHH!&quot; The two howled in unison as their tails finished growing. The two while exhausted, snapped out of their trances as Naomi peeked over the couch to look at Jake. &quot;Jake, why... Why were we howling?&quot; She asked panting hard. Jake himself was exhausted, but he seen that Naomi didn&#39;t take noticed that his tail was much bigger than it used to be. Uh... I don&#39;t... Know.&quot; Jake lied. He knew exactly why they did. But it seemed that the reality alteration worked, except Naomi felt everything how it was supposed to. She just didn&#39;t acknowledge the fact.<br />
<br />
Naomi poked her muzzle over the couch with her giant tail waving behind her. &quot;So... You wanna snuggle up? We can cuddle each others tails if you want.&quot; The offer was too good for Jake to turn down. He could see exactly how big Naomi&#39;s tail has grown. Jake began to stand up from his desk chair wagging his one giant tail that towered a few inches over his head. &quot;Who needs blankets anyway?&quot; Jake hopped over the couch to stroke Naomi&#39;s big bushy tail. Naomi did the same with Jake&#39;s as they feel asleep happily through the night, holding each others tails.</p>
