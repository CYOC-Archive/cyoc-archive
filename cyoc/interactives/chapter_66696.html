<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cam sat up in a cold sweat.  Cory was snoring in the bed next to his.  Cam peeled back his drenched sheets and <br />
stood shivering in the hotel room.  He padded over in his stocking feet to check the thermostat, and frowned. <br />
It read 72, he cranked the temp up to 80. Then he noticed Cory's open jar of Tiger Balm on the dresser. He <br />
inhaled the musky manly smell it was very familiar.  He raised his arm and sniffed his own armpit.  His body <br />
scent seemed like a pale watered down knock-off.  He remembered the warning, but shook his head.  It was <br />
ridiculous. It was just ointment.  It had turned Cory into a real hunk.  It would probably do the same to him.  <br />
<br />
Cam walked over to Cory's bed.  He leaned over the sleeping teammate.  The guy looked more like Cam now than <br />
he looked like his former self.  Cory had obviously slathered on more Tiger Balm before going to bed. Cam <br />
thrust his hand into jar in his other hand. Four fingers plunged deep into the warm buttery stuff. Instantly, <br />
Cam felt warm all over. He was burning up.  He scooped out a handful of the ointment and slathered it on his <br />
chest. He felt dizzy, he felt high. He stumbled back to bed and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
In his dream, Lin-lin appeared walking in a jungle.  The kid was dressed in a rich silk suit with short pants, <br />
matching shoes and a parasol. He wore a festive turban too.  Suddenly, Cam stepped out of the bushes. He was <br />
naked except for his chastity device, but he was his former muscled self. He told Lin-lin that he was going to <br />
eat him. The kid offered him the parasol in exchange for his life.  In his dream, Cam danced smugly with the <br />
parasol and allowed the boy to continue on the jungle path.  Lin-lin had only gone a little ways when another <br />
Cam stepped out of the bushes.  This one looked identical to the first, but it had no parasol. Cam heard <br />
himself threatening to eat Lin-lin.  This time the boy gave Cam his turban.  So the dream went with another <br />
Cam twin demanding to eat Lin-lin and instead getting an article of the boy's clothing.  Finally, Lin-lin was <br />
naked except for a yellowed oversize pair of briefs. The five Cams marching through the forest encountered <br />
each other by a great tree in a clearing. Lin-lin heard them coming and climbed the tree. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am the handsomest,&quot; said the first Cam puffing out his chest and waving his umbrella around.<br />
<br />
In his bed, Cam thrust out his sunken chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you see I look better in my fine headdress,&quot; countered the second Cam testily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silly Cams,&quot; laughed the third Cam. &quot;The shoes make the man!&quot; He held up his shod foot which like <br />
Cinderella's stepsister's didn't fit him at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not shoes! This jacket makes me the best dressed,&quot; said the fourth.  He couldn't even button the jacket which <br />
was ripping at the seems as it stretched across the fourth Cameron's broad shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha, you four are jealous, you all wish you were wearing these handsome purple shorts!&quot; said the fifth <br />
Cam.<br />
<br />
They began berating each other and trying to take the other's purple garment. Soon they were chasing each <br />
other around the tree that Lin-lin was hiding in.  They ran faster and faster. The garments got tossed on the <br />
ground as they ran. Faster and faster they ran. Their bodies began to glisten with a yellow sweat.  Soon they <br />
started to melt and soon nothing was left but big ring of Cam butter surrounding the tree.  Lin-lin climbed <br />
back down from the tree.  He dressed himself in his clothes, and then gathered some broad leaves from the <br />
forest to carry the tiger butter home.<br />
<br />
Later that day at his father's restaurant, Woo's pancake house, Cam's teammates entered.  They didn't look at <br />
all like Cam in the dream.  They were all seated at the counter with heaping stacks of pancakes slathered in <br />
cam butter.  They ate and ate and ate. The Cam butter was all gone, and 40 identical Cam's were seated at <br />
Woo's counter, all his teammates had become Cam, and Cam was gone. <br />
<br />
The dream was disturbing and didn't make any sense. Cam woke up.<br />
<br />
He was immobile in bed.  His body coated with a yellow popcorn buttery substance oozing from every pore in his <br />
body. He could hear Cory stop snoring and start sniffing. <br />
<br />
Cory woke up, and smacked his lips, &quot;Something smells delicious!&quot; He followed his nose over to Cam's prone <br />
body and knelt over him. He sniffed again. Then tentatively he stuck out his tongue and licked the yellow <br />
slime off Cam's chest. His face lit up, and he began licking in earnest and smacking his lips.  The faster he <br />
licked the more Cam seemed to ooze more of the yellow stuff. <br />
<br />
Cory grabbed his cellphone and started calling his teammates. Soon all of Cam's teammates were gathered around <br />
him struggling to lick the intoxicating yellow substance seeping out of his body. Tongues were everywhere <br />
slurping and sucking. The football players pushed against one another like baby piglets struggling to get to <br />
the sow's teat. One would get his fill and be pushed back and another would take his place.  Cam could feel <br />
himself shrinking.  He felt the heavy steel device slide off his cock. Cory no longer looked anything like <br />
Cory, he was now Cam's twin - the old Cam's twin - Cam was sure that he no longer looked like himself. Why had <br />
he gone and used that Tiger Balm. He was sure he was dreaming there were now at least 20 twin brothers <br />
gathered around him with another 20 close cousins everyone looked like him, except they loomed larger than <br />
life.</p>
