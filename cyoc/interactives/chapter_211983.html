<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aya has now been quarantined for two weeks and is finally getting used to her condition.  She knew her libido was very high, but at least she wasn&#39;t surprised anymore every time she turned into a sex monster. She was allowed to visit other quarantined patients, but avoided this as she was still embarrassed to be seen transformed. Even though three days earlier she had started to hear groans coming from the next room, where she learned that a boy who had also developed WSMS had been quarantined.<br />
<br />
She was lying in bed relaxing a little when Erika, the second nurse to enter the office and had been fucked by her on the day of the first exams, came in and walked straight to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want something with me Erika?&quot; Aya asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I came here because the last results of my exams came out and it was concluded that the syndrome is not contagious, so I will be able to leave the quarantine and resume my normal life tomorrow.&quot; Erika said<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know that.&quot; Aya said<br />
<br />
&quot;It is, but I would like one thing before that.  I was really scared that day that you ended up raping me, but when I thought about it these days that I was quarantined I started to like what happened.  I&#39;m talking about having sex with a sex monster, and I believe that if our initial approach had been different I wouldn&#39;t have been scared.  In short I want to say that, I want to have sex with you again.&quot; Erika said<br />
<br />
Aya tried to change Erika&#39;s mind by saying that she never knew what she was going to be after the transformation and could end up hurting her, but the nurse insisted anyway, saying that she wanted to try her luck. <br />
<br />
Thinking that this would be a great opportunity, Aya took advantage of the fact that she was already naked, as she had given up dressing after several clothes were destroyed in her transformations, and laid Erika on her bed.  She lowered the nurse&#39;s pants and panties and started licking her pussy, meanwhile she stuck one hand in her  own pussy and with the other played with her own breasts, raising her level of arousal to activate the transformation. The first sign of change was unlike any other, as Aya&#39;s face merged with the nurse&#39;s crotch, completely sealing her mouth and Erika&#39;s pussy. Her arms also merged with the woman&#39;s legs, which reformed into a new, long, thin black pair that was clearly not human. From the sides of Aya&#39;s torso, another pair of these long legs grew as her entire body turned black, her legs split, becoming four, changing shape and position as the rest of her body inflated to almost become a black sphere.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Aya, I didn&#39;t expect you to end up fusing with me.  You&#39;re also turning into a giant spider and... oh, this is so exciting.&quot; Erika said, informing Aya of what was going on, as she herself couldn&#39;t see anything from her position.<br />
<br />
Now Erika was a drider and had Aya as the spider that was her bottom half, but still had the top half of the girl&#39;s head intact in her crotch, which was looking up at her. This didn&#39;t last long as what was left of Aya&#39;s head inflated as her hair fell out, and took on the distinctive shape of a ballsack, in which her eyes remained and with the new position she could only see everything upside down.  Aya&#39;s nose also elongated into a three foot long cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Aya, this is wonderful.  So this is what it feels like to have a dick?  It&#39;s so sensitive and the way it pulses makes me feel like I&#39;m going to come just by touching it.&quot; Erika said, but there was no response, as in her current form Aya was unable to speak.<br />
<br />
They soon discovered that in their shared body, Erika only had control over the human part of her, while Aya had complete control over the arachnid part, despite the fact that both could feel everything that occurred in her entire body.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now what can we do?  Now that I have a dick I want to fuck you, but I can&#39;t with you fused to me like this.&quot; Erika said and, seeing no other alternative, she was going to jerk off, but they heard a very loud noise coming from the next room and ran to see what had happened.<br />
<br />
Arriving in the neighboring room, which was that of the new patient with the syndrome, they found the lower half of the torso of a woman who had no legs sticking out from under the bed.  Erika pulled it out and found another legless female bottom half.<br />
<br />
&quot;That must be Jason.  Apparently he was listening to us through the wall and we turned him on.  He was very unlucky with his change this time, without having legs or arms he can&#39;t do anything on his own and will probably stay that way until someone does something.&quot; Erika said<br />
<br />
Aya wanted to communicate that they could help him, and being unable to speak she stomped her front left leg on the ground and throbbed their cock.  The nurse got the message, but she had an idea and took Jason in her arms, so they carried him to Aya&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Erika explained that they could take advantage of their form to create a web and fuck Jason in it, and the bottom half liked it. They didn&#39;t know how the spiders spun their webs, but they managed to spin one strong enough to keep it a few feet off the ground, where they took Jason and stuck their dick in one of his pussies. His body in this form was very short, so that when Erika and Aya&#39;s cock passed through his womb, it found another exit on the other side and the tip came out through his other pussy.<br />
<br />
After the women came and Jason had two orgasms in a row, the transformations reversed.  Jason returned to normal as did Aya and Erika, who separated and no longer showed any signs of having ever been merged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for your help.&quot; Jason said as soon as he finished getting back to normal<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a real pleasure for us.&quot; Erika said<br />
<br />
The trio then spent the time talking, as they had been trapped in the web made by Aya and Erika when they were a drider, which was quite resistant and which they were glued to. They just had to wait for the web to start decomposing a few hours later.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
In the afternoon of the following day, Aya was distracted by a movie when Erika appeared saying that her discharge had been cancelled, because when she woke up that morning she was a sphinx.<br />
<br />
&quot;So my condition is really contagious.&quot; Aya said<br />
<br />
&quot;From what we&#39;ve seen the syndrome is contagious, but after seeing what happened to me the doctor came up with a theory that he wants to discuss with other doctors.  Turns out I got the syndrome but Michelle, that other nurse you fucked with me the other day, didn&#39;t get the syndrome, I am the the only one who got it. After I told the doctor about you fusing with me when you shifted, he formed the theory that when we merged my body received the WSMS gene and I kept it even after we returned to normal. Other than that, as far as anyone knows, there&#39;s no other way, not even fucking the person.  The biggest danger you run in a sexual relationship is getting someone pregnant.&quot; Erika said</p>
