<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lilith Fruit had a nasty habit of appearing in unexpected places. Not every fruit was a comical imitation of a detached sexual organ. Some Lilith Fruits blended in with normal, everyday produce. An unlucky grocery shopper could find themselves developing unexpected mutations and powers from a banana they bought from Wal-Mart. The cause of these sudden and random appearances was the pursuit of the greatest sleuths of a generation..<br />
<br />
The ambiguity this unpredictability provided an opportunity that Allen planed to exploit. Allen was a young, 20-year-old man that was still living with his mother and two sisters. He had managed to get his hands on a Lilith Fruit. At least, that was what his supplier had told him. Allen marveled at it. So much power held inside a seemingly normal peach. A devilish grin dances across his face from ear-to-ear. He had plans for this fruit.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow was Allen&#39;s youngest sister&#39;s 18th birthday. His sister, Dakota, would have four of her friends over to celebrate with her. Of course, his mother, Carol, and his oldest sister, Hailey, would be there, too. <br />
<br />
It was Allen&#39;s plan to personally bake Dakota a birthday apple pie. She had always liked pie more than traditional cake. So, this would be the prefect birthday gift for his sister. Of course, he would subtly slip the Lilith Fruit into the cake. Then, Dakota and her friends would all get sexy super-powers.<br />
<br />
So far, Allen&#39;s plan had gone off without a hitch. He had diced the normal apples and mixed them with the imposter. No one in his family was the wiser. Allen had put his Lilith Pie into the oven when the first guest had arrived.<br />
<br />
Her name was Yvonne. She was one year older than her sister and was a Freshman in collage. She had played for the high school&#39;s basketball team and was currently playing for a local collage team as a walk-on. She was close friends with Hailey, Allen&#39;s older sister. They were on the same basketball team. Yvonne was tall and athletic and the most physically active of the group.<br />
<br />
Then, Rachel showed up. She liked to draw and watch cartoons and anime. She wore a lot a graphic tee-shirts that advertised the shows she had watched. She often drew in a more Western-style. She did not tend to draw anime-style characters. Although, the influence was there.<br />
<br />
Kelsea arrived with Rachel. She was not close friends with Dakota, the birthday girl. Rather she had showed up as a friend-of-a-friend. She and Rachel often hung-out together and watched Anime and similar things. They were like two-peas-in-a-pod. She also had a developing crush on Allen.<br />
<br />
Vivian was the last to arrive at a fashionably late time. She was the only girl invited that was not a virgin. Sure, the other girls had boyfriends. But, none of them had gone all the way. Vivian had originally planned to ghost Dakota&#39;s birthday party. However, she had dumped her latest boyfriend a few days prior. So, she had nothing to do on a Friday night. She might as well spend it at Dakota&#39;s lame party.<br />
<br />
Dakota, for her part, was a quiet young girl. She had a meek personality that didn&#39;t stand out. She tended to blend in with the company she held. But, she was introverted and a good listener. Her naïve and open-minded nature brought a lot of different people towards her.<br />
<br />
A minute after Vivian arrived, Allen&#39;s pie was done cooking. He set it aside to let it cool. Kelsea told Allen that it smelled really good. The others agreed with her. 30 minutes had passed and the pie was cool enough to eat. Allen cut it up and split it eight ways.<br />
<br />
Allen gave one to Carol: his mother, one to Dakota: the birthday girl, one to Hailey: his older sister, one to Yvonne: the college athlete, one to Rachel: the artist, one to Kelsea: the young heart, one to Vivian: the school slut, and one to himself. All eight of them sat around the table with Allen&#39;s hot pie in front of them. The seven women dug into their desserts without the knowledge of Allen&#39;s tampering. <br />
<br />
Allen had to stop himself from chuckling. He could not wait to see what would happen. He dick was as hard as diamond just thinking about it. Of course, there was the chance that his supplier had lied to him and he had just given him a regular apple. But, Allen didn&#39;t want to think about that. He would have his day.<br />
<br />
Allen turned his attention to his plate. His own piece of Lilith Pie. He debated with himself. He wondered if it was worth the risk of becoming a mutant himself to gain power. He shrugged it off. It was batter to eat it. It removed him as a suspect and it might endear one of the other girls to him. Allen ate the pie.<br />
