<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric yawned as he woke. He glanced outside to see what time it was, but remembered quickly that it wouldn&#39;t help. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes as Clyde snored next to him. He tried to move, but his reindeer had him pinned, his arms firmly around him in a tight embrace. He sighed contentedly and tried to go back to sleep but couldn&#39;t. He always woke up early on Christmas.<br />
<br />
It took him a while to carefully extricate himself from Clyde&#39;s vice grip. He didn&#39;t want to wake the sleeping reindeer--at least not yet. But finally he was free as Clyde grumbled in his sleep and rolled over, the blanket coming with him and revealing his naked furry body, morning wood and all. Eric stood smiling as he watched him sleep for a moment, but soon turned to tip-toe down the stairs.<br />
<br />
According to the clock, it was nearly 9 PM. Considering that they hadn&#39;t returned to the North Pole until early afternoon, it made sense, but it was still weird for Eric to think about. The most Christmas-y place on the planet spent most of it asleep. He chuckled, but quickly walked up to the Christmas tree they had set up in their living room and grabbed the present he had hidden before they went to bed. He was proud of himself for not immediately revealing it after they had returned to Santa&#39;s Workshop--Dave had it waiting for them--but Clyde was tired and distracted, and he wanted it to be special.<br />
<br />
He crept back up the stairs and set the brightly wrapped box at the foot of the bed. <i>Time to wake the beast.</i> He grinned and crawled onto the bed lightly. Clyde was mostly on his back, and his arm was on his stomach, so Eric carefully moved it out of the way. He thought a moment and removed his wooden antler before setting it gently on the nightstand. This would be easier without antlers, and he looked forward to trying some more things out once Shedding Season hit.<br />
<br />
Carefully, he leaned forward and dragged his tongue along Clyde&#39;s cock. The reindeer shifted as his dick pulsed against his tongue, but he continued to snore lightly. Eric took the opportunity to bury his nose in Clyde&#39;s balls as he snorted. He lapped at the furry orbs before returning to his present. He nibbled carefully at the warm flesh and kissed at the ridge. The snoring stopped as the dick flexed against his muzzle.<br />
<br />
He continued, emboldened, and began to kiss and lick along the length as Clyde shifted more onto his back to give him easier access. He grinned up at his sleepy reindeer as he took the length into his mouth. Deep-throating wasn&#39;t as obvious a thing with a muzzle, but Clyde was large and thick, and Eric danced his tongue along the shaft as he took it entirely, his nose brushing up against the the soft pubic fur. He smiled at the sounds Clyde made as he suckled while flexing his lips. He thrust his head back and forth as the reindeer&#39;s breathing deepened and he tasted salty precum, which he lapped at more eagerly.<br />
<br />
Clyde was definitely awake by now as he groaned and snorted. Eric continued more aggressively now as he rubbed at his own throbbing dick with his free hoof. It wasn&#39;t long until he was rewarded with a mouthful of hot musky jizz, which he swallowed and lapped at eagerly, continuing to tease the shaft until Clyde was squirming at the overstimulation. He had to be pushed off of his prize as he laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Sexy Face.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde reached forward to grab at his antler and pulled him up onto the bed with him to give him a kiss. &quot;Good morning. I see someone&#39;s awake earlier than we had agreed. We&#39;re not due to Bix&#39;s house for another couple of hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged, &quot;I couldn&#39;t wait.&quot; He grinned and reached to grab the package he&#39;d retrieved earlier. &quot;Here, this is for you. It&#39;s not <i>technically</i> a Christmas present, but I can&#39;t wait any longer for you to open it.<br />
<br />
The reindeer gave him a look, though took the package and carefully began to remove its many ribbons and bows. He took his time, and Eric urged him to go faster, but he grinned and continued his slow, methodical pace. Finally, he pulled open the box to reveal the dagger Eric had given him when he&#39;d made his decision. Now, however, it was complete. Eric had secretly given his broken antler piece to Dave, who agreed to work on it while they were on the flight now that he had some time. The wooden antler hilt was also in the box, just in case Clyde wanted it as well.<br />
<br />
Clyde slowly traced his hoof across the beautifully carved hilt as his eyes grew moist. Eric smiled and leaned forward to put their heads together, his missing antler making the uneven position more special in the moment. &quot;I love it,&quot; Clyde whispered. &quot;Thank you, Söpö.&quot; He pulled Eric into a kiss as they cuddled on the bed.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;NO WAY!&quot; Tom exclaimed as he tore away the wrapping paper. &quot;This isn&#39;t even out yet. How did you even swing this?!&quot; He immediately started to open the box to the new VR headset as Lars looked proud of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have my ways,&quot; the fox teased as he poked at the brand new tablet Tom had given him, &quot;But I&#39;ll <i>never</i> reveal my secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone had assembled at Bix&#39;s house to open presents. Tom and Lars had spent the morning with Lars&#39; family, and Michael, Theresa, and Otso had spent the day tearing down the temporary medical stations after releasing the last of their patients. They now sat around the living room laughing and snacking among the growing piles of gifts and wrapping paper.<br />
<br />
The only one wearing clothes at this point was Theresa, who wore a green silk dress over her reindeer form and her new Opal Necklace (her birthstone), which Bix had given her. She even had a couple of baubles hanging from her antlers. Oh, and Otso who wore a green and white Ugly Christmas Sweater featuring wolves and pine trees--a gift from Clyde and Eric. &quot;This is the tackiest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. I <i>love</i> it,&quot; he gushed before immediately putting it on.<br />
<br />
Michael had given Eric and Clyde tickets to several of the theme parks in Southern California, and Bix and Theresa had gone in together to get Eric, Clyde, Tom, Lars, and Tag small matching leather bags. &quot;Holding Bags, based on Santa&#39;s. They can hold up to 100 pounds but they only weigh 5, regardless of what&#39;s inside.&quot; Bix explained. &quot;Don&#39;t lose those. They&#39;re not easy to replace!&quot; Eric couldn&#39;t believe it, but already had plans.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s gift from Clyde was a beautiful leather harness which crossed over his shoulders and under his arms, and across his chest and back. It had brushed metal studs along the length and the black finish really popped against his fur. He absolutely loved it, though nothing could compare to Clyde&#39;s expression when he opened the gift he&#39;d gotten his reindeer. It was two packages. The first contained a small piece of paper - a voucher for tickets to any Broadway Show of his choice. (Humphrey had connections.) The second, however, made the reindeer cry: Eric had managed to find his original ticket from that first flying lesson, which he framed. He made the frame himself using Clyde&#39;s tools without him knowing, and it was rough but it was the thought that counted. He found himself getting emotional, too, as Clyde pulled him in for a tight hug.<br />
<br />
It was Tag&#39;s turn as he ripped open the obviously shaped gift with a toothy smile. &quot;A surfboard! JOOOOOOO! BEACH TRIP! <i>Kiitos, veljet!</i>&quot; He immediately started to push it into his bag to see if it fit, as the glossy orange and blue board disappeared. &quot;This summer is going to be <i>Eeppinen!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric got Bix a bottle of Blanton&#39;s Bourbon, which he immediately opened to taste, and he got Michael a leather jacket that went well with Otso&#39;s. He&#39;d pretty much exhausted his meager savings, but his new job got him some good discounts directly from the workshop. With Clyde&#39;s permission, he gave his mother a card which detailed his gift to her--the transformation collar. She had already been using it, but it was what the gift meant more than anything. He was saying he approved of her relationship with Bix, and still wanted her in his life if she wanted it. She nodded and smiled warmly as she leaned into Bix, who sat with his arm around her. &quot;Thank you, Eric.&quot; The gruff reindeer nodded and winked with a grin.<br />
<br />
He got Lars a box of peppermint bark, and a rainbow knit scarf which reminded him of his aura. Though it matched the air glittering around Tom more in the moment, as he opened his gift before immediately shoving it out of view, looking massively embarrassed. Lars peeked under the wrapping paper and shot Eric a double thumbs up with a cheeky wink--he&#39;d absolutely make use of Tom&#39;s new handcuffs and muzzle. Eric and Clyde couldn&#39;t stop laughing as Theresa brought over the last present under the tree.<br />
<br />
The package was small but immaculate, and the tag read <i>&#39;To Eric. With Eternal Gratitude, Santa.&#39;</i> Surprised, he opened it up to find two small metal rings. <i>Santa apparently had a thing for rings. The lyric to Twelve Days of Christmas made more sense to him now.</i> He turned them over and looked to Clyde, who looked just as confused as him. He found a small card in the box with instructions. They were called <i>Sending Rings</i>, and they allowed instantaneous communication between the rings, no matter the distance. <i>&#39;Just tap three times and hold.&#39;</i> Eric considered the rings before he handed one to Clyde. &quot;I think this one is meant for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reindeer nodded and looked his ring over as Eric tried tapping on his. &quot;Hello?&quot; His voice came from the ring in Clyde&#39;s hooves, clear as day. He laughed and ran outside as soon he heard Clyde&#39;s voice coming from the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I bet we could swap this with the ring on your harness.&quot; <i>How did Santa always know?</i><br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Everything was cleaned up and they were about to go their separate ways for the night as Michael&#39;s heart beat loudly in his chest. He fingered the small package in his jacket pocket. He&#39;d managed to keep it hidden until now and it was finally time. He cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Actually, there&#39;s one last gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Otso turned to look at him as he stood near the tree. His white fur shone with the rainbow of the multicolored lights, and he looked adorable in that stupid sweater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, everyone? Sorry. Otso has one more gift to open.&quot; He waited for everyone to gather around again before he walked up and handed the box to the doctor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, for me? Thank you, Michael.&quot; He tilted his head, looking at the small present and began to unwrap it as his tail flicked curiously. While he was distracted Michael dropped to one knee. Wrapping paper tossed to the side, Otso considered the small velvet black box before opening it to reveal the silver ring.<br />
<br />
Michael&#39;s heart skipped a beat as the werewolf stared down at him, his mouth open. &quot;Otso, <i>My Love.</i> You&#39;ve helped me to find my way back to my pack. But it will never be complete until you&#39;re a part of it as well. Will you marry me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The werewolf, who usually knew exactly what to say was at a loss for words as he stood there, looking overwhelmed. His ears splayed as his tail began to wag. He sniffled and nodded his head as he whimpered softly. Still unable to speak, he nodded faster and reached out to take Michael&#39;s paw, pulling him up into a wet kiss in front of everyone as they cheered. Finally, his voice full of emotion, he spoke nuzzling into Michael&#39;s neck. &quot;Yes. Nothing would make me happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael smiled as his tail began to wag as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know, about silver? Usually everyone gets it so wrong.&quot; Otso asked softly.<br />
<br />
Michael froze. <i>Oh shit. Silver and Werewolves.</i> &quot;Uh, I didn&#39;t actually. Is it OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
Otso licked his cheek. &quot;More than OK. Silver represents devotion and true love, which many falsely associate with weakness. But in truth it signifies strength. It&#39;s perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Relieved and more than willing to celebrate the unintentional victory, Michael bumped their noses together with a grin and kissed his werewolf once more. &quot;Merry Christmas, My Love.&quot;</p>
