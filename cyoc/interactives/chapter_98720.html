<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s note: I just wanted to point out that Diane Tucker is Kathy Tucker&#39;s sister-in-law, not her niece.)<br />
<br />
Kathy slumped into her chair stunned. What was going on shouldn&#39;t be possible but apparently it was. The question is how was it happening. Rikki should be retaining male genitalia even if it was smaller. That wasn&#39;t the case though. She thought back to what the paramedics had told her about what Rikki muttered while she was out and apparently having a fever dream. She was saying that she was a fourteen year old girl and in school. While there was the possibility that she could lose some of her memories due to the loss of some brain cells being destroyed and might have to relearn some things that wouldn&#39;t explain being fourteen years old. It was true that once a normal became a werebeast their cells regenerated some giving them a more youthful appearance but that was only because of the longer lifespan of a werebeast, Rikki certainly wouldn&#39;t age backwards to fourteen. Of course she was being surprised right now by Rikki actually becoming female so there may be more surprises. Still she couldn&#39;t quite see how Rikki could become fourteen unless... She looked up as a nurse walked in and asked, &quot;Lauren, do you know what the age of the female normal who provided the first blood we used is?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lauren stopped and thought for a moment before replying with, &quot;I believe that she&#39;s fourteen. Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy ran a hand through her hair letting out a little sigh. &quot;I don&#39;t really believe that dreams can predict the future but Rikki had said she had dreamt that she was a werecheetah and younger,&quot; she said shaking her head. &quot;Also the paramedics said that she kept muttering about being a fourteen year old girl while they were bringing her to the hospital. With her apparently becoming female one part of her dreams seem to be coming true. The second part about her age if it comes true will bring about some difficulties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Lauren asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if Rikki stayed the same age but just looked younger we could pass it off as some cosmetic surgery,&quot; Kathy said looking down and half closing her eyes while rubbing her belly. &quot;But if she does become fourteen we won&#39;t be able to pass that off as cosmetic surgery. I&#39;m not sure how the mayor will want to handle that but I think it will involve saying that Rick Plunkett is missing or dead. In fact if she does become fourteen in essence Rick Plunkett will be dead and Rikki will need to have someone adopt her.&quot; As she said that she thought about if her and Frank could adopt Rikki if that happened which she was starting to think would happen. By unspoken mutual consent they both got back to work and Kathy muttered, &quot;This is certainly proving to be a strange case with Rikki having Klinefelter syndrome.&quot; Little did she know that it wasn&#39;t only her treatment that was transforming Rikki into a fourteen year old girl but that of Henry&#39;s as well though she wouldn&#39;t find that out for hours yet. As she got back to work the thought of Klinefelter syndrome brought a horrible thought to the surface. The werebeast virus of a male only species entered through the Y chromosome but since normal females didn&#39;t have a Y chromosome the virus couldn&#39;t enter. This would result in the virus being expelled and doing no harm to the female and they could become a different werebeast in the future but what if a male with Klinefelter syndrome decided to join an all male species. What would happen due to the extra X chromosome? Would the cells break down the same as with a male trying to become an all female species? She didn&#39;t want to find out the hard way what would happen. She had to make a call for the safety of any normal who might have Klinefelter syndrome. This was too important to waste time so she dialed the mayor&#39;s private number. When he answered she said, &quot;Mayor Stoval this is Dr. Tucker. I need a complete ban on werebeasts turning normals into werebeasts until the normals have been karyotyped. It&#39;s a matter of life and death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:<br />
<br />
Frank had left the courthouse and gone back over to the police station to get Diane and go to the hospital. However he was met with a very stubborn officer who said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry but we can&#39;t release your sister at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She needs to complete Rick&#39;s transformation though,&quot; Frank said again running a hand through his hair.<br />
<br />
The officer sighed and said, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be telling you this but the DA has decided to charge her with a Statute 1-A violation and that&#39;s if Mr. Plunkett survives. If he doesn&#39;t then the DA is going to charge her with a Statute 1 violation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank was in shock. Diane was being charged for an accident which hadn&#39;t happened before. &quot;But it was an accident that she scratched him,&quot; he tried to tell the officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any other time she might not have been charged if it was an accident but after what happened with the rogue werevixen the DA is cracking down on the forced transformations even if it was an accident,&quot; the officer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But can&#39;t you send her to the hospital with police escorts?&quot; Frank asked trying to sound reasonable.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that my hands are tied,&quot; the officer said obviously not liking it. &quot;Your sister won&#39;t be allowed to go to the hospital until there&#39;s a good chance that Mr. Plunkett will survive though I have to say that I doubt he will from what I know.&quot; Seeing that Frank was about to argue the officer said, &quot;Look, I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want your sister to come to any harm. Now think about the harm she&#39;d suffer if Mr. Plunkett died while she was having sex with him. I&#39;ve heard about how it might look for a male infused with a female only variant of the werebeast virus dying and I have to tell you that as a seasoned officer I wouldn&#39;t want to witness and I shudder to think what it would mentally do to a girl having sex with that unlucky bastard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank turned away because there was nothing he could do short of breaking Diane out. He wouldn&#39;t do that though since the officer was right about one thing, he didn&#39;t want any type of harm to befall his sister. It was bad enough that their parents had died and no one else in the family even offered to take her in. To witness a death like what has been theorized would be bad enough but to actually be having sex when it happens. Frank shuddered just thinking about it and he had to wonder if Rick did die if he would need some extensive therapy from just imagining that. Well anyway he had to call his wife and tell her the bad news though it wasn&#39;t as bad as it could be.</p>
