<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the Moon Lake Police Station, while others were wrestling with the Mandatory Were Law and rumors beginning to float around the school, Detectives Denny Miles and Miles Lukasky were busy with their present case and one that loosely related to some of the other issues that had been going around Moon Lake of late. It was a mystery that had come out after the death of Alice Decrux and involved a threat to Alice&#39;s daughter Megan. The threat involved one threatening phone call and then got bigger when they found that someone had bombed Alice&#39;s car, and the city was fortunate that the bomb didn&#39;t kill anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how&#39;s Ms. Decrux doing?&quot; Detective Miles asked he looked to Detective Lukasky, who was presently looking over the female wereraccoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far... okay, though on edge, all things considered,&quot; Detective Lukasky answered, &quot;and she wants to go back to work... but... until we catch this guy...that would be unsafe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Detective Miles nodded as the two sat at their desks in the station, one of the few offices that the station had dedicated to a police detective, which Moon Lake had assigned to allow for a higher skilled officer to handle potential mysteries involving weres that happened in Moon Lake. At present, that is what they felt they had, particularly given that the security camera footage they had showed a male transformed wereraccoon place the bomb and then leave the area around Megan&#39;s car. In this they were one hundred percent sure as to at least one were being involved in the crime. But beyond that they didn&#39;t have too many clues into specific suspects to look into, partially because they knew that the list of people that Alice Decrux had wounded was long. They didn&#39;t think the culprit was female, as the initial call that had been made to Megan Decrux was said to have been made by a male, but that didn&#39;t mean there was a short list of cases.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while we still have a list of suspects to go over... I would agree,&quot; Detective Miles commented as he looked over to stacks of papers on his and his partner&#39;s desk, which largely contained the various lists that they needed.<br />
<br />
One was the list of law suits that Alice Decrux had filed for custody of the children she&#39;d conceived and thus secured child support payments under that ruling. Among them was one case where Alice had ultimately lost the case, and while there was some idea that George Leprue wouldn&#39;t go for revenge, particularly against Megan Decrux, they had to at least keep it as a possibility given how long Officer Leprue, one of the MLPD&#39;s patrol officers had held the desire to catch Decrux for what she had done to his younger brother ten years before. And that case was the last case involving Alice Decrux from the court system. The other stack was a paper list of records from the hospital in which Alice Decrux was listed as the mother. Much of this was normally restricted, but given that the best clues they had as to who could be threatening Megan Decrux included either someone that had been wronged by Alice Decrux, which would include any male that she&#39;d mated with and made pay her child support, or a male child that for some reason wanted in on the will that Alice had left to Megan. <br />
<br />
This meant compiling a rather lengthy list, which was already growing longer than originally expected. Even Decrux&#39;s lawyer was on the list of potential suspects, at least with regard to possible motives related to Alice&#39;s will. Though this was something minor and could be handled once they&#39;d sorted out which male lovers/children were still in Moon Lake or at least had come into Moon Lake recently. Thus the two detectives went through each set of lists and either wrote the name down or went to check and see if the child was male or female. It was a time consuming process and one that was taking time, often because they&#39;d need to then double check things with whether or not the suspects were still in town. It was something that made the years of Alice Decrux&#39;s actions rather tricky and frustrating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man... she&#39;s been doing this for what... thirty... forty... fifty years...&quot; Detective Lukasky sighed as went over the list of medical records on his desk, &quot;and we&#39;re STILL picking up the pieces from her... even after she&#39;s dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice Decrux was a real piece of work,&quot; Detective Miles answered, &quot;but Megan isn&#39;t like her mother... and we&#39;ve had our own records where there have been domestic disturbance calls to the Decrux home to find both arguing over something... often related to a man that Alice was courting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Detective Lukasky nodded and resumed going over his stack of papers and going over the names. As he came across male children, he also wrote down the father&#39;s name, just in case that the child ended up changing their name. Contacting the father might be a way to see if they could find the child. Of course, they might also have to cross out cases that would connect to cases that went through the court system. If they were court cases, then Detective Miles would also have the record and they&#39;d still have a case to go through. Most of Detective Lukasky&#39;s work was to get the cases where the father DIDN&#39;T get sued, which likely meant that he and Alice had come to some other arrangement. There might be some questions with them too, but given Alice Decrux&#39;s reputation as a seductress... he wasn&#39;t completely sure that a relationship that didn&#39;t go to court would have the venom in it to trigger the decision to threaten and potentially kill Megan Decrux.<br />
<br />
It took both detectives a few minutes to go through the list. As Detective Lukasky finished he looked up and over to Detective Miles who was seated with one notepad who looked to already be ready, which made sense as the number of cases that had gone to the courts over child support was fewer than the total number of children that Alice Decrux had given birth to.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you have?&quot; Detective Lukasky asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;A fairly short list,&quot; Detective Miles spoke, &quot;starting with George Leprue, then Maxwell Veers, then Bernard Irmington, then Marshall Lemming, and finally Alexander Mason... all those being men that Decrux seduced and got to pay her child support through the court...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that count the lawyer?&quot; Detective Lukasky wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Detective Miles answered, &quot;but he will be the first person we interview in this... see what he&#39;s said an thinks. What do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one name would double up... a Micheal Decrux... son of Marshall Lemming,&quot; Detective Lukasky spoke, &quot;the remaining male children would be a Thomas Decrux, son of Elton Pyre, a Paul Decrux, son of Ryan Manx,  Vernon Decrux, son of Miles Washington, and Nelson Decrux, the son of Ulysses Thule. So that would mean we have ten former lovers, one lawyer, and five male children wanting to inherit from Alice for some reason... Now all we have to do is see who is still in Moon Lake... and THAT will be fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Detective Miles nodded, &quot;and Ms. Decrux... will she be fine with all this? The time needed to go through it all, I mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Detective Lukasky said slowly, &quot;I mean she&#39;s told me she wants to get back to work... but I wouldn&#39;t think she&#39;d put herself at risk by going out...&quot;</p>
