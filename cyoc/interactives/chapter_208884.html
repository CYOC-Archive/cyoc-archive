<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brandon’s  father, Eli, looked suddenly horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, dad...it&#39;ll all be over soon...at least I hope it will,&quot; said Brandon, taking a few steps back.<br />
<br />
Eli gasped as he noticed himself in the small round mirror situated high up facing him on the wall. The wall grew upwards, shooting past his view. He could no longer see the mirror anymore...it was like being inside a room inside the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland...but that was impossible!<br />
<br />
It dawned on him the wall was not growing, but rather, that he was shrinking. In panic, he ran into the bathroom, stumbling because his pants had grown baggy and were now several inches too tall for his legs. He turned around in a daze and his son, walking casually into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, dad, it&#39;s  all your own fault. You wanted me to be bigger and faster than my body was ready for. So *I* decided to just TAKE you up on your offer!&quot; Eli saw that his son&#39;s voice had grown tight on him, cracking and jarred, and Brandon’s  stomach could now be seen to have wisps of fine hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;But this can&#39;t happen! Brandon I&#39;m your father, whatever I&#39;ve done it was because...because...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you wanted to be in control. You wanted me to feel weak and beneath you. You wanted me to feel guilty because I wasn&#39;t the best physical model for a boy my age. Well I guess I just decided I&#39;d have to take care of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon  was fifteen by all appearances now. His face was still like a child&#39;s, but his frame had grown taller, and his stomach could now be seen amply, and his legs were spindly, but he now came up to his father&#39;s neck. His neck!<br />
<br />
Eli fumbled around in his clothing, unable to move, the shock of being stuck in time overwhelmed him. None of this seemed real, only in a dream could such a thing occur. But it wasn&#39;t, and he knew it. All of his dreams were slipping away, like his clothes were slipping around his body. He stuck his hand around hopelessly into his pants, trying to clutch them to his frame. He could easily move his hands around, and if he let go of his pants now, they would fall to the ground. He turned to walk over to the door and stumbled and fell because his shoes were now way too oversized  for his feet.<br />
<br />
Getting up he saw his son face-to-face. Brandon grinned devilishly. He now looked noticably older, his face had taken on not just the dim facial hair growth that would take quite some time for Eli to get used to, but his face had grown, his chin strutted out, his mouth was bigger, his entire lower face looked strong and shone with sweat and stubble. His hair was fine, spiky, and thick, and his skin flushed with color. Brandon spoke in a voice now unfamiliar: &quot;Dad, think of it this way. You get to have what people only dream about...you get to be younger..ha ha.ha!&quot; <br />
<br />
Brandon looked at himself in the hallway mirror, moving outside his father&#39;s line of vision. Eli felt himself on the verge of tears. He numbly walked out, dragging and hopping along with his pants until he finally gave up and walked outside of them...leaving his manly slacks on the floor, abandoned. <br />
<br />
It was a good thing Brandon wasn’t wearing a his shirt as his arm muscles had already become positively huge. He looked like the quarterback for a college football team. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddio! Check out this package.&quot; said Brandon, grinning, and posing a flexed bicep over Eli. Brandon’s face was much more square now, his body lean and perfect, and imposing. He was an adult. <br />
<br />
Eli had become shorter and shorter as he watched, mesmerized. He was now only in appearance the age of thirteen, and his manly visage disappeared in a ripple once, twice, three times until he had the humble face of a mere child. Everything about him that had once exuberated confidence now dwindled to nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad for eleven, huh, dad?&quot; he said, laughing and grinning as he flexed his now massive biceps. Brandon backed up and joyously surveyed the room, in his too-tight underwear which could by the way no longer completely cover his immense shaft. &quot;Ohhhh, man. Oh man, I can&#39;t believe I did it!&quot; said the unfamiliar man now looking down on Eli. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe it either,&quot; said Eli, looking like he was playing dress up or make believe, in his white collar shirt. He slowly took it off and stood helplessly before his son. Brandon scratched one of his bulky pectorals and reached down and lifted Eli off the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get to be the adult now and you don&#39;t have any decisions to make,&quot; declared Brandon, sounding for all intents and purposes like a grown man. &quot;And if you don&#39;t like it, tough. Cuz&#39; you&#39;re not getting the chance to go back. I like this body and I like being bigger and in charge.</p>
