<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ya know,&quot; the girl says with a sigh &quot;I&#39;m never going to understand guys.  I mean seriously.  You walk into someone&#39;s house - no knocking.  You walk up their stairs - no calling out to see if anyone&#39;s home.  You walk into my bedroom, touch my clothes and then fall asleep on my bed.  After all that you have the nerve to act surprised when I tie you up like a birthday gift?  Really?&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...when you say it like that...&quot; you say, you can feel heat on your face as the blood rushes to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least you have the decency to be embarrassed about it, blushy.&quot; she says with a wry smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not blushing.&quot; you say, blushing furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys.&quot; she shakes her head and rolls her eyes.  She looks at you for a little bit before smiling &quot;Hmmm....I was going to wait before doing this, but whatever, you only live once.&quot; she says and approaches you.  She straddles your stomach and looks you directly in the eyes.  She gazes at you with an intensity that begins to make you nervous.  Well, more so anyway.  You turn your head away from her, but she grabs your cheek in her hands and brings your attention back to her.  Her large green eyes flash an odd pinkish tint and glow ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look into my eyes.&quot; she says.  You do.  You don&#39;t want to, you want nothing more then to turn away from her, but your eyes are fixed on hers, you find you can&#39;t even blink.  As she stares at you her hands begin to glow, she places them on either side of your head and focuses on you as though she were trying to read your mind.  What happens next is hard to describe, though you&#39;re certain you&#39;ll never try.  You can see a vague pale pink outline leaving her body, sinking into yours, at the same time you see a similar outline leave yours and push itself towards her.  As the two lights cross paths there is a brilliant light that blocks out everything else.  She fades from view behind it and all you can see is white.  You finally shut your eyes, but you can still see its remnants behind it.<br />
<br />
You feel the strange essence resting on your prone, bound body, forming a pair of pert breasts, a shoulder-length mane of hair, a slender build that sinks past your own, and a decidedly feminine set of organs between it&#39;s legs.  You feel your own body sinking into it.  As it does you become aware of long hairs tickling your shoulders and neck, you feel her breasts poking from your chest, her slender, hairless legs becoming your own.  You become aware of her womanhood as though it was your own.  As the light fades you gasp and the voice that echos from your throat is familiar, yet alien to you.  Your eyes pop open and you look up.  You see yourself staring down at you, with a smug, satisfied grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...this&#39;ll take some getting used to.&quot; you hear your voice say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?!&quot; you cry out, causing him to cover your mouth with his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh...I don&#39;t want my aunts to know I&#39;ve done this.&quot; he says to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my g...it&#39;s...I&#39;m you.&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...you&#39;re you.  I&#39;m me.  We just swapped bodies.&quot; he says to you &quot;Now I&#39;m going to untie you, but if you don&#39;t behave I will switch back, but by the time you get back in here you&#39;ll be a bra.&quot;  Seeing no other option you nod in agreement.  With a tug of the ribbon the whole package you&#39;re wrapped up in comes loose and you&#39;re finally free.  You roll out of the bed and look at your body.  You&#39;re dressed in the clothes she was wearing.  You run your hands across her, now your, body and face.  You rush over to the vanity and look at yourself in the mirror, mouth agape as you look at the face of a young woman staring back at you.  You see your natural body come up behind you, placing his hands on your shoulders and rubbing them a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty hot, huh?&quot; he says.  He walks back a few steps and examines himself &quot;Can&#39;t say the same for you.  Bit pudgy, the t-shirt is old, and these jeans.  Are they some sort of store brand?&quot; he shakes his head &quot;And I&#39;m going to have a serious word with your hair stylist too.&quot; he says as he examines your clothes, body and hair.  &quot;Still, with a little work....oh that reminds me...&quot; he says and walks back over to the vanity pulling open a drawer and retrieving a few stacks of paper, bound by a pastel blue binder clip.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my body back.&quot; you say to her in a harsh whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get it back, sweetie, don&#39;t worry.  I just need to take it for a spin.&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long of a spin?&quot; you ask, your teeth clenched together.<br />
<br />
&quot;A month, maybe a bit longer depending.&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;A mont-!&quot; you begin to cry out before his hand covers your mouth, the other raising a finger to his lips and making a &quot;shush&quot; noise.<br />
<br />
&quot;A month?&quot; you say again in a harsh whisper &quot;Unacceptable, I want back in there right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?  Then go ahead.  Use magic to change us back.  Go on.&quot; he says, arms crossed in front of him.  You glower and get a smug smirk in response &quot;That&#39;s what I thought.  Now I may be curious about how guys live, but don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not going to move in here.  I&#39;ve worked too much keeping that body of mine in shape to trade it in for this.  During the transfer I read enough of your memories to live your life for awhil-wait you work in data entry?&quot; he says distastefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;It pays the bills.&quot; you say with a glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pays the pizza guy too, I guess.&quot; he says putting his hand on his belly.  &quot;Anyway, there&#39;s some stuff you need to know.  Technically you may already, actually - some of my memories may have copied onto you - but I&#39;m not going to count on that.  First of all your name is Tammy Sayke.  You hate being called Tamara.  You live with your aunts...well Auntie Vina - the blonde one - is your aunt.  Aunt Raymira, one with black hair is her cousin, I&#39;m not sure exactly what makes us, but I call her Aunt Raymira.  Auntie Ray-Ray if I want to annoy her.&quot; he says and gets a wistful smile before getting serious again &quot;But you most certainly don&#39;t.&quot;  With that he puts the stack of papers in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I had a feeling I was going to end up doing this, so while you were sleeping I drew up a list of things you&#39;ll need to remember about our body.  In this list is hair care, clothing care, what we eat, what we don&#39;t eat, shaving schedule and techniques, and certain...well...other things you&#39;re going to need to know about our body and how to handle that.  You&#39;ll probably want to read that part a few times.  Most importantly you will NOT tell my aunts I did this.  Everything else should come naturally.&quot; he says and looks at you, hands clasped in front of him, smiling.  There&#39;s a small pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I suppose that&#39;s about it.  I have to go, if your memories serve me correctly you&#39;ve got to be at work at 8:30 am Monday.  See you in about a month.&quot; he says and waves, with that the door closes sounding almost like a cell door slamming shut to your ears.  He opens the door again &quot;Don&#39;t redecorate my room.&quot; he says sternly and closes the door again.<br />
<br />
You sit at the vanity looking at your reflection, your mind trying to come to grips with what has just happened.  You stare blankly for almost a minute, hands hanging loosely next to your body as you sit in the chair in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;A month?!&quot; you cry out.</p>
