<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey its being awhile since we chilled how are you doing&quot; Jessica heard from her play pen as his sister was talking to another female with a familiar voice he heard the door shut as the other woman responded &quot;Ya i have being busy with schooling is Jeff here?&quot; Sarah looked at the 6ft red head that was just as old as Jeff&#39;s original age and she started to talk to her and guided her into the living room &quot;So he wanted to give a try at being a baby girl for a week or two, had me change every one memory&#39;s but your&#39;s and mine so he can get the full experience.&quot; Sarah said with a smirk on her face &quot;Awwweee he i mean she is so cute my boyfriend makes for such a cute baby girl, looks like she wet herself though&quot; as she reached down and looked as Jessica who was blushing out of how awkward this was she then reachs out to pick her up he/she tried to tell her the truth &quot;Alysha help me i didn&#39;t ask for this it is weird and awkward, i don&#39;t want to be a girl&quot; but it only came out as baby babble again and Alysha giggled at how cute it sounded &quot;Ya i noticed that she peed herself but i don&#39;t know were the diapers are hidden, perhaps you can help me find them?&quot; Asked Sarah to Alysha as she then Grabbed Jessica from her hand&#39;s &quot;Ya sure&quot; Replied Alysha as then both took off up stairs with Jessica and Sarah guided Alysha into Jeff&#39;s old room and showed her the program she used to transform Jeff with &quot;Ya its use full for example if i type your name here, and diaper here and press enter!!!&quot; She explained to Alysha her actions.<br />
<br />
 as Alysha was about to say &quot;What&quot; but got cut off half way when her voice disappeared she tried to throw her hand to her mouth only for thin white tabs to come shooting up sticking to her face she struggled to remove them as she feel to the floor with a soft landing she watched as her feet disappeared and also turned into tab she tried to do what she can to get back up but she slowly sank into the padding as her vision started to change to the front of the diaper the rest of her face went inside it as pictures of childish cartoon character&#39;s appeared on her she started to fold up until she couldn&#39;t move at all not even wiggle she watched as Sarah came into her view laughing &quot;Well Jessica looks like Alysha her will have her self a nice job holding your poo and pee, and will have a nice home attached to your hip&#39;s hugging and kissing your ass and vagina until she ends up in the dump with your dump&quot; Sarah then picked up Jessica and brought her to the mirror so she can see what she was resorted too she then brought both them into Jessica&#39;s room were she put Jessica and Alysha the diaper down she then took the tabs off the diaper Jessica was wearing and lowered it as Jessica looked down to see what was there and wasn&#39;t surprised to see nothing but Sarah taking a baby wipe to a strange crevice that he felt knowing it was his new equipment he tried to fight but couldn&#39;t all he could do was lay there and watch and Alysha was unfolded and the old diaper taken away as Sarah lifted Jessica&#39;s ass and placed her former girlfriend underneath her and the front brought up as Jessica started to smell stale piss and could taste it because she was pressed right up in there and then tapped together from the tab&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Sarah then lifted up Jessica brought her to the mirror were she can see in horror her Ex girlfriend puffing out from under a dress resorted to being a little girls diaper for her Boyfriend who was turned into t little girl wearing her &quot;Well looks like you two are a proper fit, i always thought she had a potty mouth any ways so now she does&quot; As Sarah then carried them down stairs and into the kitchen were she put Jessica in a highchair and Alysha felt a large amount of pressure as Jessica sat down on her Sarah grabbed some baby food Jessica/Jeff was scared of the next part Sarah opened a thing of string beans baby food grabbed and spoon and started to shovel it into Jessica&#39;s mouth she couldn&#39;t eat it properly it was sliding out of her mouth and it was so nasty feeling going down she didn&#39;t notice to Alysha&#39;s horror as she was eating she started to fart into Alysha&#39;s face and all she could do was smell the awful smell as then Alysha started to feel really warm and blotted she started to puff out as all she could taste is a Salty Spicy taste Jessica just noticed what she did and started to cry as Sarah then looked down to see the yellow stain threw the cartoon design&#39;s she laughed &quot;Awweee little baby use her diaper, its all good you didn&#39;t go poopoo yet so you can still wear her&quot; she then lifted them out of the chair and patted the wet warm diaper closer into the front of the diaper so she adsorbed more be she brought them into the living room placed them down into the play pen were Alysha was in torture and Jeff/Jessica Embarrassed that here he was a grown man now a little baby girl and he was worried for his girlfriend because he knows were diapers go when there finished being used.</p>
