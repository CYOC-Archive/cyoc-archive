<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joel headed next door to the ceramics shop, coming down from the buzz of making away with stolen good.  He laughed as he went inside to look for his mother but stopped short.  It was the ointment store again.  He could have sworn...<br />
<br />
He rushed back out the door, suddenly a tinge of fear taking hold of him.  Though as he went through the door the tinge went into a full blown panic.  As he walked out of the store.. right back /into/ the store.  He was starting to freak out and turned around to bolt out the door again, but he suddenly felt a small pinch at the base of his neck and couldn't move, he just stood there frozen.  He tried to shout for help but not even that would work.<br />
<br />
The old man came around to stand in front of Joel.  &quot;I said we would meet again, yes?&quot;  He held up a bunch of needles for Joel to see.  &quot;Acupuncture.&quot;  The old man flipped the closed sign on the door and studied Joel for a moment.  The old man pulled the jar of ointment from Joel's jacket and shook his head.  &quot;Very rude to steal.  I would have lowered price, but instead you steal.  Lesson must be taught.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man set to work, maneuvering Joel into the store's back room.  It was a long process as, while Joel was small, the man was hardly young and no longer in his prime.  Next he set about removing all of Joel's clothes with a pair of scissors.  Then he drew out four more needles, one for each of Joel's arms and legs, before withdrawing the one at the base of his neck.<br />
<br />
The paralysis left Joel's throat in an instant, as did his sobbing pleas.  His arms and legs were still locked in place, but at least now he could speak and move his head.  &quot;Please, I'm sorry.  I won't ever do it again, just let me go.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man shook his head sadly.  &quot;No, I cannot.  I must deal with thieves, but I am not without mercy.  You see, I need an assistant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But.. I'm not even from around..&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man cut Joel off.  &quot;No, you will not go back to your old life.  You will stay here to help me.  You must be taught manners, I will act as your grandfather in this.&quot;  The old man walked over to a table full of ointments and set to work, mixing them together in a large stone bowl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, mister..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandfather.  You will address me as Grandfather.  And no, I will not change my mind. I need strong shoulders.  Deliveries, pick ups, someone to watch store.  Maybe even learn and take over eventually.  I have no more family.  But now I will have a grandson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joel went into sullen silence, looking at himself in the mirror hanging on the wall in front of him.  He was scrawny, and with his clothes off his pale skin was clearly visible beyond the normal lines of his farmer's tan.  He had almost no body hair, another thing for which he was embarassed.  There were kids in his class shaving, and he barely had pubes, he didn't even have any on his legs, well, none noticable.<br />
<br />
The old man.. Grandfather, Joel corrected himself, came over with the bowl, and a large brush.  The ointment in the bowl smelled of fresh herbs and exotic spices, a much more pleasant smell than he had previously experienced in this shop.  Grandfather began to sing a soft song in Chinese to himself as he dipped the brush in the ointment and began to paint it on Joel.  &quot;This will feel strange, but it is for your own good.&quot;  As the ointment touched his skin it felt ice cold, then warmed into a comfortable heat that seemed to sink into his muscles.  Once he was painted from head to toe, Grandfather set the bowl on the table and left the room.<br />
<br />
Joel had nothing but to look into the mirror, wondering what was supposed to be happening.  Did he look... taller?  No, it must just be a trick of the lighting, but certainly h is legs weren't that long before, and his joints did ache slightly, as if he was being stretched.  No.. his head was definitely closer to the top of the mirror frame.  Well at least some good was coming of this.  Not only was he getting taller, but his shoulders were broadening a bit.  It looked like he was going through a growth spurt in fast forward.  Everything on his body looked to be getting thicker, his skin stretching as new muscles grew beneath it, causing the skin to ripple slightly as they grew and moved.  His chest had been flat before, but now he clearly has a pair of pecs.  In a disturbing image his stomach seemed to ripple as it divided itself into six square muscles.  Even his legs and arms were more toned.  He wasn't bulky muscular, but lean and athletic.  This was the sort of body he would have loved to have, just not in this situation.<br />
<br />
His hair started to pull back into his head a few inches, until a couple inches of hair stood up from his scalp in a natural spikeyness.  The roots of his hair darkened, crawling up his hair to the tips, turning the blond hair pitch black.  The hair around his cock spread outwards a bit, a slight trail growing up to his navel, the brown hair also turning a deep black.  His legs and arms grew a light coating as well, but no where else.  He wasn't as hairy even as a few of his former classmates, but it was better than what he had before.  He was beginning to wonder what sort of justice this was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
A pressure in his face made him squint for a moment, but as he reopened his eyes, he noticed in the mirror they didn't open as wide as before, and his irises were now a dark brown.  His eyelids seemed to have smoothed themselves out, his eyes looked almost Asian.  His nose flattened a bit as his nostrils widened.  The bones of his face continued to change, his jaw becoming more square, as his cheekbones became higher and more pronounced.  The baby fat melted from his face, leaving it lean and masculine.  Looking at himself in the mirror he certainly wouldn't pass as a thirteen year old anymore.  In fact, he would barely pass as a teenager.  His chin and lip itched for a moment as a sparse black goatee grew in, as well as a bit of sideburns.  The color of his skin began to alter, the pinkish hue darkening just a bit as it took on a more yellowish tone, his nipples turning a pale brown.<br />
<br />
His cock gave a small twitch, his balls swelling to a more adult size, similar to ping pong balls.  His cock thickened and elongated, fortunately one stereotype that didn't seem to fit, as his flaccid cock stopped at a respectable six inches.  The skin moved along the shaft, pulling down over the head where it reformed a foreskin.  His cock suddenly sprang to erection, growing into a thick eight inches.  With a gasp, he experienced a sudden orgasm, his cock shooting the last of his previous body's genetic material in burst after burst of cum until he felt completely drained.<br />
<br />
Grandfather came back into the room shortly after that.  Now Joel could judge his new height at somewhere just shy of six feet.  He was scrutinized by Grandfather for a moment who gave a satisfied smile and nod.  &quot;Good.  You are Joel Greene no more.  Now you are Joel Hu, my nineteen year old grandson.  Do you understand me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joel was about to agree without thinking, before he realized that Grandfather was speaking Chinese.  He gave a short nod, &quot;Yes, Grandfather.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you cooperate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Grandfather.&quot;  Grandfather stepped over to Joel and took out the needles.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are clothes there on the chair.  Get dressed and come out front to the store, I must begin teaching you.  So much to teach.&quot;  With that Grandfather left the room once more, leaving Joel able to move once more.<br />
<br />
He stretched his new muscles, getting used to his new body.  It seemed to be brimming with energy.  He picked up the clothing looking it over.  Black pants and simple shoes, and one of those Chinese button up shirts in blue silk, with a black vest to match.  He got dressed without thinking about it, as if he had been wearing these types of outfits his whole life.  He gave one last look to the nineteen year old Chinese man looking back at him in the mirror, the clothes making him look completely the part.  Then with a small sigh he went to join Grandfather out front.</p>
