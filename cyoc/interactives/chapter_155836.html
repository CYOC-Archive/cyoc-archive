<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Many people needed to work off some extra calories after Thanksgiving. Allura and Beacon had to work off a lot more than usual. Because of the anglerfish&#39;s capacious appetite and expanding stomach, their Thanksgiving meal had turned into a small feeding frenzy. The end result were two very bloated stomachs that were almost to heavy to carry. The two of them would have quite a lot of weight to lose when they were finished digesting.<br />
<br />
Their post-digestion state had a few mixed results. Not as much waste came out as Beacon expected. Considering meals were not easy to find in the abyssal zone, their bodies were designed to metabolize as much as they possible could. Their bellies were only half the size they had been after their gorging. Though it was clear that extra mass had been distributed everywhere, namely into their breasts, hips, and asses. Not strictly a negative thing, though it meant more elastic clothing until they could shave off those pounds. They also noticed their muscles had bulked up a noticeable amount, doubtlessly because of all that protean they ingested.<br />
<br />
Even so, there was more girth than they were comfortable with and the extra padding on their curves made them more saggy than sexy. As such, the two anglerfish were going to the gym as often as they could. Xena was there to help them through their weight loss, now that she was a registered trainer. But even with their Animalian metabolism, that extra weight wasn&#39;t going to disappear overnight.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Allura and Beacon had been on their weight loss regimen for a few days when they were approached by an unusual couple. They didn&#39;t look particularly strange, in fact they were completely human. Though that itself may seem a little strange in a place so frequently visited by Animalians. Though they had darker skin than Caucasians, but Allura couldn&#39;t place what ethnicity they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scusa me,&quot; said the man to Beacon, &quot;But you&#39;re the one called Allura, yes?&quot; Well, that clarified who they were instantly. Definitely Italian, most likely Southern Italy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, we are Allura,&quot; said Allura.<br />
<br />
The woman gave Allura a confused look before looking around. &quot;You are both Allura?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m Beacon,&quot; said Beacon, &quot;Allura is a...composite being. Shi&#39;s technically two fish uplifted into one being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We know we are one, but our, uh, subconscious still sees us as two,&quot; said Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;Itsa fine,&quot; said the man, &quot;We wanted to know who is who.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you two are?&quot; asked Beacon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Andrea and this is my wife, Alita,&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t &#39;Andrea&#39; a girl&#39;s name?&quot; asked Allura in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s supposed to be gender-neutral,&quot; said Beacon.<br />
<br />
&quot;In different countries, itsa more masculine or feminine,&quot; said Andrea, &quot;In Italy, itsa primarily masculine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it would be apropos if we go through with it,&quot; said Alita with a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go through with what?&quot; asked Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were a-planning to be converted into <i>vacche</i>,&quot; said Andrea, &quot;How do you say? Oh, right, cows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; asked Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were a-thinking of becoming herm cows,&quot; said Alita.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Beacon before realizing what they were saying, &quot;Oh! Well, I suppose that would have come around eventually. Come to think of it, I probably should have expected it sooner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll be a big beef cow and Alita will be my little milk cow,&quot; said Andrea.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could do that the other way you know,&quot; said Alita teasingly, &quot;I like the idea of a-being bigger than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that sounds interesting, but why talk to us about it?&quot; asked Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wanna know what itsa like for you two,&quot; said Andrea, &quot;You know, being both husband and wife together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allura and Beacon exchanged glances before Allura said, &quot;We never really think of ourselves as husband or wife. We mostly think of ourselves as mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you become a herm, you start giving up old gender roles,&quot; said Beacon, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if you were male or female before you start. As long as you have a mate, you just see each other as equals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though you may have to decide among yourselves over who has to be pregnant,&quot; said Allura, &quot;We want to be father first, though we haven&#39;t succeeded yet. Though we&#39;ve tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, we&#39;ve certainly tried,&quot; said Beacon, thinking back to their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Not many tourists came to Mieni Atoll in November and it was too early for cold-sensitive Animalians to start coming here. So Beacon and Allura had plenty of space to themselves when they came here on their honeymoon. &quot;We still don&#39;t see why we don&#39;t just move here,&quot; said Allura, &quot;The weather is better here and we always have the sea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure we can afford to live here,&quot; said Beacon, &quot;I mean, how money can I make on my art living here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think there&#39;s a good market for that, no matter where you are,&quot; said Allura, &quot;And we can do work here, like deep water tours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure other people will be able to dive down that far. But I understand what you mean,&quot; said Beacon.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we think this would be a good place to raise our spawn,&quot; said Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re planning to raise them?&quot; asked Beacon teasingly, &quot;I thought once you hatched, you were on your own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re in a much more dedicated relationship than that,&quot; said Allura fondly.<br />
<br />
Beacon kissed hir mate on the cheek and said, &quot;How about later we make a start on that spawning?&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Thanks to the lack of tourists and wintering Animalians, it was easy to book Lover&#39;s Lagoon again. Beacon was tempted to not bother wearing hir bikini to the lagoon, but they couldn&#39;t walk around nude on the main island. Shi did like the way shi looked in hir bikini anyways. And Allura was irresistible in hirs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know if there has been any successful matings here?&quot; asked Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you mean if anyone&#39;s actually been impregnated in this lagoon, I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; said Beacon, &quot;Not everyone keeps track of when and where their children were conceived. And it&#39;s not the usual thing you talk about, not in polite company anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we are glad we are in impolite company,&quot; said Allura before shi removed her top.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t waste time, do you?&quot; asked Beacon, feeling hir dick starting to rise out of its hidden compartment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve been waiting quite a long to make some eggs,&quot; said Allura, dropping her bottom, allowing the mating tool that was hir male half to bob out in the open air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I shouldn&#39;t make you wait too much longer,&quot; said Beacon as shi also stripped.<br />
<br />
The two of them jumped into the lagoon and swam down to the bottom. Beacon shook hir ass invitingly. Allura was quick to respond, swimming up behind hir and allowing hir fishing rod to slide between Beacon&#39;s cheeks teasingly. But shi didn&#39;t spend a lot of time teasing, shi wanted to put hir seed to good used. Backing up a little, shi plunged into hir mate&#39;s pussy. Beacon gave out a gurgling moan as shi felt hir mate entering hir. This would hardly be the first time shi was on the receiving side, but doing it underwater was more satisfying. Perhaps shi should seriously consider moving to Mieni Atoll. But future plans were driving out of hir head by the incredible pleasure of the present.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Though Beacon left out the raunchier details, shi did give Andrea and Alita the gist of it. &quot;We haven&#39;t succeeded yet,&quot; said Beacon, &quot;Allura thinks it&#39;s because we&#39;re not in the right season.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll happen eventually,&quot; said Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I think the point we&#39;re trying to make is that going herm would make a relationship more equal than people would think is traditional,&quot; said Beacon, &quot;I would support you if you go through with it, but it&#39;s not something to do on a whim. There&#39;s no way to take that back, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don&#39;t regret it, right?&quot; asked Allura.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only thing I regret is pigging out so much at Thanksgiving. Now if you two will excuse us, we have some weight to lose.&quot;</p>
