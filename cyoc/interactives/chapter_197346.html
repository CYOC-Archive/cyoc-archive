<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dude! Looking good,&quot; Kaleb said. Marcus looked a bit confused as he walked into the locker room. &quot;The beard?&quot; Kaleb continued. &quot;Looks good man. You should&#39;ve been growing that out for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Marcus smiled as he ran his hand across the facial hair. &quot;Right. It kind of grew in last night and I didn&#39;t have time to shave it. It looks that good though?&quot; He went over to the bathroom part of the locker room and gave it more of a look. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s not as bad as I thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell no man,&quot; Kaleb gave him a firm slap to the shoulder. &quot;Looks fucking great. Makes you really look like a man&#39;s man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think?&quot; Marcus continued looking over himself. &quot;You know it really does.&quot; He flexed his arms in the mirror. The definition in his arms seemed to have become more prominent. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quit flirtin you two,&quot; Gabe grumbled as he walked over to the urinal. &quot;But if you&#39;re gonna fuck at least be good enough ta wait till everyone&#39;s out of the locker room.&quot; When he finished, he pushed Marcus to the side and washed his hands. Then headed for the weight room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...&quot; Marcus mumbled. &quot;Does he look bigger to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaleb stared for a second. Gabe, being such a large man, needed to wear incredibly large clothes. His tall, bulky but built frame was perfect for a lineman. But at the same time his clothes did seem to be a bit tight. The two round globes of an ass seemed to be on prominent display and his shirt seemed to be pulling at his shoulders. Not to mention how his belly seemed to hang a bit further out. Kaleb figured the other man would be around 300+ pounds but he seemed even heavy compared to that. &quot;Maybe he&#39;s been bulking,&quot; Kaleb said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or it&#39;s bloat,&quot; Marcus chimed in. &quot;Dude eats whatever he wants and pretends it&#39;s normal.<br />

<br />
&quot;Or it&#39;s bloat,&quot; Marcus chimed in. &quot;Dude eats whatever he wants and pretends it&#39;s normal. Maybe he&#39;s finally packing on the pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...&quot; Kaleb said. He didn&#39;t want to say too much with the possibility of still being in Gabe&#39;s way. No reason to make him mad. Or at least madder than usual. He followed Marcus up to the weight room and started working out with him. It was a bit odd. Something about the way the weight room was today just felt different. Kaleb couldn&#39;t quite place it but looking around, everyone seemed to be just a tiny bit different. It was like they were pushing themselves a bit harder. Or maybe it was the smell. It was usual for a weight room to smell. But this was a bit different. Instead of the normal musk and metal or men, it almost smelled a bit like a zoo. <br />
<br />
He tried to ignore it as he worked out, but something was off. Like when he looked over at Dylan. The guy&#39;s hair was normally pitch black. But it almost looked like there was some grey running around his ears. And when he lifted up his shirt, there was a distinct trail of hair running along his abs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Marcus pushed Kaleb. &quot;Quit starin.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaleb was pulled out of his thoughts for a second. &quot;Right...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Marcus hissed. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; his voice was low, but the serious nature of it really freaked Kaleb out.  &quot;I knew you were big but fuck man. You wanna share some of that?&quot; He tried to play it off as a joke, but his voice undercut it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Kaleb tried to massage his shorts and shake his legs. Even flexing to move the blood somewhere else. But nothing seemed to work. &quot;I gotta take care of this,&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t keep me waiting,&quot; Marcus chided. <br />
<br />
Kaleb wanted to issue a firm punch to his arm or at least give a &#39;fuck you&#39; but his embarrassment overtook him. He hadn&#39;t done this in years. He&#39;d learned a method in hiding his boners, yet this one just came on. All of a sudden too. He rushed to the locker room. Then to the bathrooms. However, he was in for a surprise. It was already occupied. Clive was sitting on the toilet with his own dick out. &quot;Sh-shit!?&quot; Kaleb stared, mouth hanging open. It was massive. At least for someone like Clive. The small guy needed both hands to properly control it. And he seemed to still be having a bit of trouble.<br />
<br />
But the surprise led to another. Clive&#39;s body shook as he released all over the stall. With a mighty, &quot;Hungh!&quot; he finally came back down, only then realizing that Kaleb was standing over him. &quot;Ka-Kaleb!?&quot; he instantly tried to cover himself up with whatever he could. However, his hands did little to do so. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! Look! Please don&#39;t tell coach. Or the other guys. Please! They already think I&#39;m gay and this will only make it worse! Please don&#39;t say anything! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaleb paused. He still couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing. He&#39;d always thought black guys had big dicks, but this one would run any of them for their money. It had to be almost 10 inches. And thick. &quot;I--&quot; Kaleb&#39;s voice cracked. He felt his own dick harden. It running down his leg made him really question everything. &quot;I won&#39;t say anything. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Clive jumped up from the seat. &quot;Thank you! Thank you so much!&quot; he repeated. Then backed off and pulled up his shorts. &quot;I&#39;ll make it worth it. Promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...&quot; Kaleb said. He rubbed his boner again, thinking about that dick. Then turned around to see the mess the other man had made. &quot;Damn it...&quot; he groaned.</p>
