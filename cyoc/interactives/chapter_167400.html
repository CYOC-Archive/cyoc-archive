<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Getting from Wisconsin to Heiya Island proved to be far more difficult than originally anticipated. For given America&#39;s issues with the Covid 19 pandemic a good many countries were banning travelers from the US from entering their countries. And while Animalia had its &quot;colonies,&quot; like Heiya Island, the biggest thing was these colonies were not independent countries in their own right. They were tied to their &quot;host&quot; nations, and Heiya Island was part of Japan. It was only after some wrangling between Shuixing and some of Heiya Island&#39;s local officials wrestling with the Japanese government over Nate&#39;s status. For Nate Bowman had made no statement on renouncing his US citizenship and at the same time, the fact that one Animalian had contracted Covid 19, there was proof that even if the Animalia Virus could &quot;cure&quot; someone with Covid 19, that didn&#39;t mean it would serve as protection afterward. The only agreement was reached after the point had been made that Nate had been involved romantically with Shuixing for a few years and that Shuixing was already a Heiya Island resident.<br />
<br />
But once that was handled, Nate was happy to visit the island again and in a way happy that he could stay by Shuixing&#39;s side. He might still have to go back should the University of Wisconsin decide to have in person learning, and for the most part that seemed likely at present, but it would still be for his senior year and to a degree some things were arranged for all contingencies, many of which couldn&#39;t be fully certain, yet. The big part of the visit was really to let Shuixing introduce him again as her mate rather than just as a student/friend/boyfriend. Though the entrance came with some some of the same tests that Heiya Island had had standard, even before some of the restrictions on travel from America came in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... I know my nostrils are bigger now and all that,&quot; Nate said slowly as he rubbed his nose after coming out from the main medical center where he had been tested and again tested negative, &quot;but I really don&#39;t think they needed to massively enlarge the testing tip as well... it tickled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing chuckled a little at that. Nate handled the testing well enough, but from what she&#39;d observed it looked like he was being tickle tortured when the scientists did the testing, and it didn&#39;t help the doctors trying to do the test when he suddenly jerked away at the swab tickling the inside of his nose. He managed, but not without some measure amusement for Shuixing as she watched.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be fine,&quot; Shuixing told him, &quot;and there are some things that we will be doing that will make up for the tickling... Right now we&#39;re just meeting up with my sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
The walk was relatively quiet as the pair of Domestic Water Buffalo Animalians made their way toward the residence area that had been built for the Five Elements that wasn&#39;t too far from the main martial arts areas that had been set up on the island. It was something that was originally envisioned as a way for some of the martial arts schools that had been built up in Animalia could have offices elsewhere and thus allow for more Animalians to learn those styles and the adaptations that would also go into them. From some of the things Nate had heard, part of the planning also included providing some measure of defense training should there ever be an instance like what had happened in Lyre/Animalia and Heather Wilcox&#39;s rampage a few years before. And on some level, those plans did seem to work, prior to Covid 19, but from what Shuixing had reported, most of those that had come as students were often Animalians coming to live at Heiya Island. <br />
<br />
As the two walked, however, Nate noticed that there was a decent number of young Human women walking around and looking at some things. It wasn&#39;t a bad thing, as much of the reporting on Animalia had generally given an indication that a fair number of people had often flocked to get a sight of an Animalian, even if they had no intention of converting. Men having interest in the generous curves that female Animalians had and women having interest in the often well sculpted muscles that male Animalians had. However, on an island with a fair number of travel restrictions, Nate didn&#39;t expect there to be many Humans on Heiya Island at present, regardless of whether or not they had escorts. Things seemed even more weird to him when it looked like most of them were female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Shuixing, do you guys normally get so many women tourists?&quot; Nate asked as they walked along and then noticed that some of those women turned to him when they heard his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think they&#39;re tourists,&quot; Shuixing answered, &quot;from what I know... is that Interpol busted up some giant smuggling ring in mainland Asia that had gone through multiple countries grabbing young women and carrying them off... sometimes killing anyone that tried to protect them. Interpol had the officers and the coordination to rescue them... but they needed a place to keep them safe while looking for any surviving family and things like that. I believe they got Heiya Island to offer that kind of safety in that we weren&#39;t dealing with Covid... and if the people rescued were... conversion could be a &quot;cure&quot; option while waiting to handle other issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... they&#39;re like you and your sisters?&quot; Nate wondered to her as the group came a bit closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way... and from what I&#39;ve heard, Heiya Island will be keeping them safe until their families can be found and until the guys behind the ring are in prison,&quot; Shuixing nodded.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, though by this time their progress was a bit impeded as the group had made their way up to Nate and Shuixing and they seemed clearly taken with him. He heard a fluttering of Chinese from the group, and while Shuixing had also taught him some Chinese as well, it wasn&#39;t enough to fully understand was said. He thought heard the word for &quot;muscle&quot; in there, but he wasn&#39;t sure. One took him by the hand and Nate thought she was going for a handshake, but she began to lift his arm up and running her hand along the short black fur. Eventually she got it up high enough that his bicep was a bit more visible from underneath his shirt and this lead into another round of Chinese and one of the other girls then hugged onto his other arm. This was not the greeting Nate expected when he came to Heiya Island. His lower lips were pulled back and he looked over to Shuixing, hoping for some help. All he got was a barely suppressed giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my bond mate has big muscles,&quot; Shuixing eventually managed in Chinese to the group that were presently fawning over Nate and his nervous look was priceless, &quot;but the most important one is his heart. It beats strong and gives him the kind courage to care for others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does he have a brother?&quot; one asked, &quot;one who could keep bad men away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Shuixing managed, though getting the sense that Blueberry might actually try to conceive with Ulysses when it came to her next breeding season. She did look over to Nate and based on his wide eyes at the moment, she was also fairly sure that the only thing he was saying was &quot;help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re one of the elementals,&quot; another of the group commented as she looked between Nate and Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am one of the Five Elements, yes,&quot; Shuixing answered, &quot;I am Shuixing and this is my bond mate, Nate Bowman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t Chinese,&quot; one of the girls hugging Nate&#39;s arm huffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He isn&#39;t Chinese,&quot; Shuixing answered, &quot;but he is kind, he&#39;s supportive, and has been eager to learn. That counts for something as far as I am concerned. And not everyone on Heiya Island is Chinese. Some are Japanese and some came from Animalia directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He still looks strong,&quot; the girl hugging Nate&#39;s other arm commented.<br />
<br />
It was by this time that the group&#39;s supervisor managed to arrive and get some degree of control of them and that let Shuixing and Nate get on their way. Their conversation was mostly limited to Shuixing explaining their interest in Nate and that she knew Nate wouldn&#39;t stray after them and that she wasn&#39;t mad about the attention Nate got, though Shuixing also had to admit Nate&#39;s &quot;unease&quot; actually made him look rather cute in that moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t believe you let them grab me,&quot; Nate answered as the reached the door to home that Shuixing and her sisters normally lived in. &quot;I think one grabbed my butt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just your arms,&quot; Shuixing answered, &quot;and besides... I know you and they are only impressed with new things. They&#39;ve just been rescued out of a tough place and I think they&#39;re still getting used to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She opened the door to a loud &quot;welcome home&quot; in both Chinese and English as Huoxing, Tuxing, Jinxing, and Muxing. Even the single dosed Liao was present, having had Tuxing pause her training session to welcome Shuixing back and Nate to what would likely be his home while the Five Elements were on Heiya Island. There might be some events that would have them journey between the island and Animalia, but that wasn&#39;t likely at present, for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome home, Shuixing,&quot; Tuxing spoke with a polite and mature smile, &quot;I trust you are happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Shuixing smiled as she shut the door behind her and Nate and then snuggled up to him, &quot;I have Nate...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll make me blush,&quot; Nate told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wouldn&#39;t notice through the fur,&quot; Huoxing assured him and came up and looked him over, &quot;and you did fill out... what can you lift now? Five... six... tanks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huoxing,&quot; Tuxing gave a slow sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Huoxing asked back and tapped the front of Nate&#39;s shirt and then turned back to Tuxing with her long orange and white striped tail held high, &quot;look at all that muscle. He has to be able to lift something heavy... like a tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Nate began as the tip of Huoxing&#39;s tail brushed against his nostrils and making him back up for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Jinxing asked as she noted Nate stagger back for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate managed after a moment, flaring his nostrils for a moment, though more to get the tickling sensation out of them than from annoyance, &quot;one of the things I&#39;ve found... since becoming an Animalian... is that some of the testing type stuff tickles. And Huoxing&#39;s tail is just long enough that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This will be fun,&quot; Huoxing smirked, &quot;but that&#39;ll be something for later. What do you think on the island?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what little I&#39;ve seen of it... going back to my last visit and the walk here,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;it&#39;s nice and I&#39;d imagine people are friendly. Though some of the people you&#39;ve rescued have struck me as a bit more friendly than I expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were rescued by Interpol, not by us,&quot; Tuxing answered, &quot;Heiya Island is largely looking after them for the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And some might have been brainwashed into worshiping the &quot;sex industry&quot; as it were,&quot; Muxing gave a grumble, &quot;worshiping Ami...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They seemed more interested in Nate than anything else,&quot; Shuixing commented with a smile, &quot;but they were friendly and accepting. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be fine in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;ve brought about some other good fortune too,&quot; Huoxing added with a smile to Shuixing, &quot;it would appear we&#39;re famous in some of the countries that that that crime group went into... one of the girls from Nepal has a brother who&#39;s followed some of out adventures on the news and so on. When she was rescued... she apparently sent out a letter or message to him as to where Interpol brought them to be safe, and the brother came here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she&#39;s been excited that the brother had interest in her,&quot; Jinxing gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he hasn&#39;t been threatening,&quot; Liao added, &quot;which is good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t think the island&#39;s authorities would let anyone that would be a threat to anyone enter the island,&quot; Nate said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;One can never be too sure,&quot; Liao answered...<br />
<br />
&quot;But you are right,&quot; Tuxing finished for her apprentice, &quot;Ami wouldn&#39;t let someone come in and cause trouble...&quot; She then paused for a moment and smiled at the happiness and joy on Shuixing&#39;s face and Nate looked happy with her, &quot;and how are you adjusting to being an Animalian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s different... not bad, but different,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;but in a way... being with Shuixing makes it worth it. There could be some issues with handling things with my senior year in college... but there is a lot of that that I can&#39;t be fully sure on at present... and a lot of that may simply be something that will have to be played by ear. But Shuixing and I have talked on that... and we&#39;re both ready and waiting for next summer. When we can marry and start on our own happy ever after, as it were. And I promise I will be good to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll hold you to that,&quot; Huoxing chuckled, &quot;or bull or not, you will be tickled.&quot;</p>
