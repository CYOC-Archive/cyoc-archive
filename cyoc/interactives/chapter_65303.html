<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kylie watched the slug girl slither into the crowd. She liked these games. She knew who she wanted to play with next. &quot;Amanda Meade! You are up!&quot; No one in the crowd moved. &quot;Amanda! I'd hurry if I were you.&quot; She waited a moment longer. Soon a girl in a soaking wet swim suit stumbled into the room and onto the stage. &quot;Ah, hiding in the pool this whole time I see.&quot; She pointed to a spot on the stage and the shaking girl walked to it. <br />
<br />
Kylie circled her, gazing intently at her body. As Kyle she had had many wet dreams about this girl, she had wanted her sooo bad. But she had never had the courage to ask her. Well now she was in her power and she didn't have to worry about what anyone else thought or about being rejected. Kylie walked forward, her witches costume burning away as she did, until she stood naked and beautiful before the trembling Amanda. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like what you see?&quot; Kylie asked sensuously, hands pressing her breasts together. Amanda nodded, afraid to disagree. &quot;Oh there is no need to lie, and many reasons not to. I could for instance make you a six titted pig girl, obsessed with food and sex.. Or perhaps I'd only make you a big beefy man who only wants to stick his dick in anything that moves?&quot; Amanda paled. &quot;No? Wouldn't like that? Well thats okay, I think I know just the thing for someone so fond of water... but first..&quot; Kylie snapped her fingers and Amanda fell to her knees.<br />
<br />
Kylie grabbed Amanda by the back of the head and shoved her face into her bare crotch. Amanda pulled back, keeping her mouth and eyes shut tight. Kylie leaned in close and with in a completely audible stage whisper said, &quot;I would try and please me if I were you...&quot; Amanda swallowed hard and opened her eyes and stared at the little bit of short black hair that topped Kylie's immaculate pussy. She slowly leaned forward and licked timidly down the side of Kylie's crotch. Slowly she made her way closer and closer, finally, as if she were jumping from something very high she plunged her tongue inside. Afterward she tried anything and everything she could to try and please the witch. Kylie pulled hard on Amanda's hair when she finally climaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very nice! I just knew you would be good.&quot; Kylie clapped her hands and two ropes appeared around Amanda's wrists. They pulled taut raising the girl in the air struggling. A rope twined around her ankles, stopping her legs from flailing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Wait! I did what you wanted! I.. I.. I can do more!&quot; Amanda shouted, terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh calm down! I know you did, and I know you would! Thats why I am not going to turn you into a shemale horse. But that doesn't mean you get away completely free. But I promise I'll make it.. pleasurable.&quot; Kylie walked forward once again, still nude and glistening with sweat in the stage lights. Amanda hung a foot of the ground, making her breasts head height. Kylie reached up and tore the bikini top away, causing Amanda to whimper and for her ample bosom fall free, nipples hard in the cool air. Next Kylie slipped a finger around the inside the the bikini bottoms, slowly letting it slip lower and lower. She gently pulled them down around her ankles and let it hang on the rope that bound her feet.<br />
<br />
Amanda was not shaved down below, Kylie noticed. dark hair twisted in a briers patch above her tight pussy. The witch stood. &quot;Ready?&quot; She asked, Amanda shut her eyes tight once again. Kylie took a nipple in her mouth and sucked gently, rolling the teat around on her tongue. She let her tongue slide out and run along the curve of the breast. She pulled back and blew lightly on the nipple, causing it to stiffen even more. Amanda moaned. Kylie took the second nipple in her mouth next, flicking and playing with the other between her fingers. As she sucked on this one Amanda's hair began to grow. It streamed down her shoulders and back like rain and finally ended in small curls over her ass. The color had bled to a deep fiery red. <br />
<br />
Kylie plopped the fat nipple from lips, gave it one last kiss and dropped to her knees. She took Amanda's feet in her hands. She let the rope and bottoms fall away. She took the toes of one foot and wrapped her mouth around them, licking between each. She did the same for the other. Then, holding the feet together she ran her tongue up the seam they created, starting at the big toes. She continued up Amanda's legs until she reached the middle of her thighs. When she let go Amanda opened her eyes. Her legs seemed the same, she tried to struggle and found that her legs were glued together. She whimpered.<br />
<br />
Kylie shushed her and sat up higher on her knees, bringing her head to waist level. Daintily, gently, she spread the lips of Amanda's pussy and took her clit in her mouth. She sucked softly, tongue flicking over the small nub. The fingers of one hand slid sexually up both inner thighs and pressed slowly into the fold and into Amanda. Amanda moaned half in protest, half in pleasure. Kylie began to pump up and down. Her other hand dug sharp fingernails into Amanda's ass. <br />
<br />
Amanda started to rock into the motion, chest heaving as she breathed harder. As she came closer and closer to orgasming the change swept up her legs. The bound limbs flowed even more together, feet splaying outward. Scales speckled her skin, a deep emerald green. Amanda screamed, hips grinding as hard as she could into Kylie's face. When Kylie stood Amanda's tail was complete. From mid thigh down her legs had changed into a long mermaids tail, now trailing along the floor with its extra length. She still had the hips and pelvis of a woman however, pussy soaking wet and bare. <br />
<br />
Kylie turned to the crowd once again and pulled two jocks up on stage. She commanded them to each take a side of Amanda and then let the ropes disappear. &quot;Take her to the pool... Maybe she will even let one of you have her..&quot; One of Amanda's hands was already playing with the hair of one of the jocks as they carried her down the stairs.</p>
