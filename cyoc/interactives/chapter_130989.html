<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gladly,” you replied, before giving her a longer kiss than Spot had, and one that she eagerly returned.<br />
It didn&#39;t feel that long to you, but you found yourself interrupted by a throat clearing noise.<br />
<br />
“Ahem,” came the cold voice of Ms. Adair. Her eyes were shooting daggers at the two of you, and you were quite sure that at least some of it was due to the protective instinct of a mother with her child. Now that you had that particularly crucial piece of information, it changed the way you saw Ms. Adair&#39;s actions previously, and her distinct interest in the way that you and Jenny interacted.<br />
<br />
The two of you immediately broke the kiss. You started to say something, only to have yourself silenced by Ms. Adair&#39;s abrupt hand in the air gesture. “Not right now, Mr. Anderson,” she said, “We have a shoot to do. This IS what you&#39;re paid for, no matter what Jenny might lead you to think your duties are.”   Jenny bowed her head after a moment of locked eyes with her mother. She was submitting; even you could tell that.<br />
<br />
Ms. Adair guided Jenny to the manacles, locking her hands in them, keeping them at shoulder level, with her arms outstretched. She unlaced the front of the dress slightly, not enough to bare Jenny&#39;s breasts, but enough to show the line of her cleavage. She strutted to the back wall, hitting a well concealed switch, causing light to shine down from high up on the opposite wall, bathing Jenny in soft white light, giving the illusion of a full moon. It was just light, though, and Jenny showed little to no reaction.<br />
<br />
“We&#39;ll obviously want you to get several shots of her staring up at the moonlight,” Ms. Adair instructed. “Jenny, I want you to look eager in the shots. You WANT to change, to escape the dungeon.”<br />
Jenny nodded, and Ms. Adair waited patiently for me to take the instructed shots.  Through the lens of the camera, the rest of the world faded away. I was in my element, and I knew just what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
“Head inclined more,” I said, “Tilt slightly to the left,” I instructed. “Bite your lip.” She followed every instruction, each shot seeming to grow better and better with every frame. She was a professional, and the camera loved her. The light gave an almost ethereal glow to her pale skin. <br />
<br />
Ms. Adair, however, seemed impatient, and strutted over, blocking my shot. I paused, confused. “Ma&#39;am..if you could just -” I said, cut off by her holding up her hand abruptly.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll be out of your way in a second. Set your camera to the highest speed setting, please,” she said. It wasn&#39;t a request; it wasn&#39;t a tip. It was a clearly phrased order. <br />
<br />
“Uhh..okay,” I said, irritated. I wasn&#39;t used to having instructions barked at me on how to do my craft, but for what she was paying me, I was willing to put up with it. Plus, this was far from a normal photoshoot. <br />
<br />
“Mother, NO!” Jenny suddenly exclaimed, and I looked up from my camera to see Ms. Adair pulling a syringe out and injecting something into Jenny&#39;s left arm.<br />
<br />
“Woah,” I asked, concerned, “What was that?”<br />
<br />
“Pure adrenaline,” Ms. Adair said with a smirk. “To bring some animal rage into her transformation.” She saw momentary worry on my face. “Don&#39;t worry,” she said, her voice dripping with an almost cruel sarcasm. “If you two get along as well as you both seem to think you do, you&#39;re in absolutely no danger. Now you&#39;d best get back to your camera. This IS what I pay you for.”<br />
<br />
I steeled myself, looking through the viewfinder, doing my best to concentrate only on taking the shots, and not the surroundings or potential danger I was in. It was impossible NOT to think about the fact I was in the room with a girl about to become a furious monster, however.<br />
<br />
Jenny strained against the chains, letting out a primal roar as her body convulsed and popped with a profound extra bit of chaotic energy compared to her calmer shift in the bedroom the day before. Her biceps swelled, and dagger claws shot from her fingertips as every vein on her body stood up, swollen to capacity with blood and that extra adrenaline. She let out a bass roar as her teeth extended into fangs, and her swelling frame began to strain the seams of the dress.<br />
<br />
Her feet scraped the floor as the transformation forced itself upon every inch of her frame with an almost destructive force. She tugged against the manacles as the shift wracked her body, and the dress fell away, giving me a wonderfully full view of her swollen teats and shifted mound as more muscle built. Finally, the manacles gave way with a snap, and she fell to all fours, completing her change, allowing me to get a wonderful sequence of shots of her muzzle extending and her letting out a menacing howl. I was so lost in the moment that I forgot that the menace was directed at me, until suddenly the beast swiped at the camera with her paw, knocking it away and knocking me down.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” I said, trying to keep myself calm. “Jenny...Jenny, it&#39;s me...” She paused, and I got to my feet, only to have her rise up with me. The extra adrenaline had given her even more height and muscle; she towered over me, and let out another long growl. “Jenny...come on..it&#39;s fine..” I said, hesitantly reaching out to her. She effortlessly picked me up by the front of my shirt,  burying her muzzle on the side of my neck. I could feel the tips of her fangs graze my skin as she inhaled deeply. I waited for a moment, then another, expecting her to kill me. Then I felt her lower me to the ground, and as I opened my eyes, I saw her lowering herself to her belly, wedging her head against my legs. I reached out to pet her, stroking her fur. “That&#39;s my girl,” I said, softly.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Adair had an unreadable expression on her face, though she was staring daggers at me. Was she upset that I hadn&#39;t been killed? “That will be all for tonight,” she told me. “I&#39;ll look at your photographs, and give you a full review tomorrow. You can go.”<br />
<br />
Jenny let out a growl, putting herself in between myself and her mother. Mrs. Adair rolled her eyes. “Stop being dramatic, Jenny. Go back to your room.” Even in her more devastating form, Jenny seemed cowed by her mother, and immediately submitted. “That&#39;s better,” she replied.</p>
