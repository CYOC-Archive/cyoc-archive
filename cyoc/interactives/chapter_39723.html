<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angelina knew that somethings was off, but what that something was, she didn't know how to describe it.<br />
<br />
There was the little clues all around her. Amelia and Anna for instance. She had memories of a little girl named Julie, who was also Anna. Anna was like her sister/brother, and yet she wasn't. In one set of memories, Anna was a boy who wanted to be a girl. In the dominant memories, the ones that matched up to what Angelina saw, Anna was just a natural girl.<br />
<br />
Amelia was different. She/he was born a boy, but wanted to be a girl. And on his fourth birthday, he received a dress as a gift and also started to take the first of three pills; the ones that altered Amelia on the genetic level. On and around her seventh birthday she began to take hormones, so that her body would be prepared for the changes that should begin when her hormones and chemistry begin to change; namely puberty.<br />
<br />
Angelina saw all this, but didn't understand it. And then there was the dreams and her. She was different, she knew this. Different in the fact that she was conscious and none of the other dolls weren't. Granted, she could only move and show signs of being real when there was no humans around. But that suited her just fine, because she absolutely adored Anna.<br />
<br />
But at night, when Anna was sleeping and Angelina would also drift off, there would come the dreams. Dreams of two boys, one named Ric and the other named Josh. And both of these boys were connected somehow to Anna, Amelia and Angelina herself. In was all so very confusing. Especially when she dreamt of the older man.<br />
<br />
His name was Fransisco Mendes and somehow he was even more connected with her then the boys. The only clue she had to work with was the book that appeared in the doll house when the girls where gone and the house was empty.<br />
<br />
The book only appeared in the library and never anywhere else. The library only came into being when Angelina was real. It took a bit to figure this out completely, but when she did, an idea began to form.<br />
<br />
In human years, she's four years old and would always be four. With this in mind and the knowledge of what happens when she's left alone, Angelina began to study the book fully. And with a little help from other books in the library, first the English and then then gibberish in book began to make more and more sense.<br />
<br />
She learned, the yes, this book is one of transformations, even if that meant crossing into other realities. She gleamed into an older life that explained in fragments who she might have been before she was turned into a plush mouse. And the most important thing she learned was that the spell she read the first time, she got lucky on the affects. And then before she could use this knowledge, Amelia became sick as her body entered puberty.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Amelia was happy because somewhere in her young mind, she knew that she may look like a boy, but she was allowed to act like what her true sex and gender said she was; a girl.<br />
<br />
She had a loving mother and a young sister to play with. Anna, who was born female both in gender and sex, had seen Amelia naked and knew that she'd been born different, but accepted her as a sister and a friend more then anything else. And when Amelia became sick, Anna was the one who was closes to her side.<br />
<br />
It happened one day. Amelia, now ten, woke up feeling slightly off; like the time she'd been sick years ago when she was seven. As the day wore on, the feeling increased; a nauseous feeling in her stomach and a tight, bloated feeling in her abdomen and groin area. She thought she could push past it and everything would be fine; she was mistaken in that thought.<br />
<br />
As she sat outside, playing with Strawberry Shortcake, Anna and Angelina, enjoying the warm summer day, Amelia suddenly felt really off, like she was going to vomit. Struggling to make it pass, she became dizzy and fell over. Her last thought of that day was Anna running to the house, screaming, &quot;Mommy! Mommy! Come quick! Amelia's hurt herself somehow!&quot; and then everything went black.<br />
<br />
Amelia awoke to talking. As the blackness of unconsciousness lurked at her vision, she heard, &quot;...reproductive organs have formed faster then we thought. Amelia is being altered....&quot;<br />
<br />
But how she was was lost as the blackness consumed her.<br />
<br />
Amelia awoke again. Something cool was being run over her body and when it got to her genitalia, it felt off, but she couldn't figure out why. A voice, the same one as before, was saying, &quot;...penis and testicles have shifted gender and sex completely. Wolffian duct and Mullerian ducts have reformed so they conform to the female body. Among...&quot;<br />
<br />
But that to was lost as the blackness again overtook her. Her last thought, before sinking into unconsciousness was, &quot;I'm a girl. Both in sex and gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Angelina was worried. Over the course of the next eleven months, Amelia was in the hospital. And Angelina was convinced that there was something in the book that could help the poor girl. And so, whenever along, she began to double her efforts. Not only to find the connections between Ric, Josh, Anna, Amelia, her and Fransisco Mendes, but also find something that could ease Amelia's problems.<br />
<br />
One day, in desperation, she opened the book to a spell that she thought might help and started to read aloud, unaware of events taking place around her.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Downstairs, Amelia was being helped into the house. She was happy because she only had to take the genetic drug only three more years, until she was fourteen. But the hormones, those she'd have to take until she was twenty one. Without really thinking about it, her hand kept straying to her groin. It was an amazement that the drug worked as it did.<br />
<br />
Between her legs she now had a fully formed vulva complete with a vagina and internal female reproductive organs. The doctors explained that her period could start any time. This made her wonder about sanitary napkins and there use as she brushed a hand against her crotch, bumping against the sensitive breast buds that'd already formed on her chest.<br />
<br />
Anna disappeared and then reappeared and was saying something. Turning toward her, Amelia heard her ask, &quot;Mommy, have you seen my Angelina Ballerina doll?&quot;<br />
<br />
-------<br />
Angelina read the spell, unaware of the events transpiring downstairs. Suddenly a familiar sensation of pleasure could be felt and the world went white. As the book slipped from her hands, all old memories of Fransisco Mendes came back and as he drifted through the whiteness, which had begun to shift, he thought, &quot;What have I done? Where did the book go? What happened to Ric and Josh? And what is happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The whiteness vanished and Fransisco found himself sitting in a classroom full of girls. A teacher could be heard asking, &quot;Joy, what is X?&quot; <br />
<br />
But all that didn't mattered to Fransisco as he suddenly realized he was wearing a high school girl's uniform, but between his legs he could feel his penis and testicles neatly tucked back and pinched in place by a pair of form fitting panties. Thinking, &quot;What have I gotten myself into,&quot; Fransisco suddenly found himself staring up at an older woman, who promptly told him, &quot;Joy, what have I told you about day dreaming!&quot;</p>
