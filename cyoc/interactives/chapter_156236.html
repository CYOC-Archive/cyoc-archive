<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad was a bit relieved with how things had gone with Connor. A part of him was a bit surprised by how quickly Connor had accepted the advice that he and Ryan gave him regarding Connor&#39;s sexuality and explaining that to his parents. For from what Tad could figure, if Connor was truly confused on the issue and had been hiding it from what had always struck him as a rather accepting family, he would have thought that Connor might resist those urges. Tad figured that he and Ryan would have to really work to convince Connor to accept that. And relief at those thoughts were on his mind as he made his way along the street to circle back to the street that he and his mom lived on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course the fact that the Rosses proved so accepting of weres was also something of a pleasant surprise,&quot; Tad thought as he rounded the corner and continued to jog home, &quot;though... still... they&#39;ve also seemed to have such an accepting and happy family. I really can&#39;t imagine why Connor felt as nervous as he did...&quot;<br />
<br />
He put those thoughts on hold as his home came into view. With the house in sight, Tad picked up the pace, dashed across the front lawn before going in through the front door and announcing that he was home. He could hear some rattling going on in the kitchen, which gave him some hint as to where Jen and Claire were. He caught a few other scents that gave him an indication of some of the other things his mother was up to while he was talking with Connor and Ryan, though he had no real problem with that. As such he went straight through the living room, dropping his backpack on the couch and the circled through the large doorway to find Claire and Jen finishing what was to be dinner for the night. It looked and smelled like boiled chicken and rice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Tad,&quot; Jen said with a small smile as her son came into the kitchen, &quot;have a good day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good... things were a bit quieter at school today over the whole reveal thing,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;a fair number of people may still be on edge, but they&#39;ve calmed down enough that throwing punches isn&#39;t as likely... maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not throwing punches is always a good thing,&quot; Claire commented as she took a plate from Jen and took it toward the dinning room and remembering the riot at the college she&#39;d gotten caught in the previous day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but it will still take some time to get people comfortable,&quot; Tad commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be something that will have to wait until after the plan is put together and then adopted,&quot; Jen told him, &quot;if people respond the way you said the Ross family did to Samantha&#39;s message, a good many people will be comfortable with it and be surprised at being fearful over nothing... If the response is negative... which is possible, some may well feel vindicated in their opposition to it. It&#39;s something that we can only wait and see on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded at that as his mother then handed him a plate and ushered him toward the door that lead to the dinning room. Tad took the plate and nodded as he went buy with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But for the moment we aren&#39;t here to talk about the reveal,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;a lot of that will be beyond our control...&quot; Tad nodded agreement to that. &quot;How did your talk with Connor go? Your text related to him doing were research.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... he&#39;s mostly looking through for some general answers right now and a friend he met on the bus on his first day at school has been helping with that too,&quot; Tad answered, though deciding while Connor would need to explain things in order to move forward, it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea to speak out on some of the things that Amy had noticed about Connor at school. It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t think his mother could or would understand the issue, for as a bisexual werecat Jen could very easily understand the possibility of being attracted to men and women. The issue was Connor&#39;s privacy and that his &quot;desires&quot; shouldn&#39;t be dinner conversation at someone else&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he have any ideas on what kind of were he&#39;d like to be?&quot; Jen wondered, &quot;for those of us who were born weres... we know what we will be... but there can be moments where your friend has things wide open before him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I believe he&#39;s looking more toward the smaller weres in question... you... those who&#39;s were form wouldn&#39;t be so big that they couldn&#39;t were anything while transformed,&quot; Tad answered as he went around to his place at the table and set his plate down on it, and finding that glasses of water had already been placed there.<br />
<br />
&quot;The water&#39;s all fresh... no need to worry,&quot; Claire assured him, &quot;but... I did get the book too... there are lots of weres that would be small enough in their transformed state to fit in their clothes. It&#39;s not just one or two...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True... and we did go over the list of those smaller weres and those that we knew at school that could help Connor with more detailed information on that group,&quot; Tad answered and let things tail off from there. For what he&#39;d shared was enough to answer the question and wouldn&#39;t get into the deeper issues that Connor was dealing with. Once Connor could state publicly that he&#39;d had some issues that left him confused as to his sexuality and was willing to share that, that would be one thing, but until then, Tad wouldn&#39;t betray his friend&#39;s trust. &quot;Beyond that... I really can&#39;t do too much more that offer support<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s good that you&#39;re there for your friend,&quot; Jen spoke as she lifted up a forkful of rice, &quot;just remember that when he makes his choice it is HIS choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, mom,&quot; Tad nodded, &quot;so... how was your day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The college was calmer than yesterday,&quot; Claire spoke, &quot;though I think some of that may be that the group that was at the heart of the fight are presently in police custody so far as I can tell... They might be out on bail by now, but the fact that they were arrested and that there will likely be some court dates coming... that MIGHT have them being a bit quiet for the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad watched as his mother finished chewing and then reached over to rub Claire&#39;s hand, which made Claire smile in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be good news then... letting things come down from the boiling point,&quot; Tad commented to which his mother and her new lover agreed to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... and I did get a call back with regard to one of my interviews... it would seem that I&#39;ve made the list for what would be considered the second round of interviews,&quot; Jen added, &quot;which will mean that we aren&#39;t just living off of your father&#39;s pension.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you,&quot; Tad gave a cheer, &quot;what&#39;s it for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d essentially be Mrs. Tachibana&#39;s personal secretary,&quot; Jen answered, &quot;it&#39;d be clerical work, but it&#39;s not bad work and in a way I&#39;d be of service to Moon Lake in general... given all that Tachibana Enterprises does... and by the time that your father&#39;s pension runs out, I&#39;d be with the company long enough that the salary/wage raises would cover the difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s good,&quot; Tad smiled, &quot;it&#39;d seem that we all had a good day today...&quot;</p>
