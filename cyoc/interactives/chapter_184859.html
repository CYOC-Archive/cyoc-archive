<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan eyed himself in his mirror. He couldn’t help patting his crotch, trying to get the front of his jeans to sit just right. Yet no matter what he did, it managed to look a bit deflated. Finally, he chuckled with an embarrassed grin, “man, this is messed up. This isn’t right….”<br />
<br />
And yet, his conscience continued to counter him with impossible to ignore whispers. ‘You had your chance. You COULD have had a big dick, a proper dick. Instead, you found yourself impossibly turned on by this tiny package. Just accept it, you are a micro-dicked swimmer, and you love it.’<br />
<br />
He shuddered as his dick throbbed to its full two inches before he gasped as a few drops of watery cum seeped from its head, clung to its underside, before slowly oozing down to this smooth, puny balls.<br />
<br />
Ethan got a used sock from the floor, quickly wiped up the mess from his ‘spectacular’ load, pulled up his briefs and pants, and half-smiled/half-frowned at his reflection. Then he looked down at the sticky sock and seriously contemplated it. Finally, he slowly rolled it over itself until it turned into an ovular ball, which he slipped into his underwear. <br />
<br />
The big guy considered how his briefs now had an appreciable bulge in them and sighed with reluctant acceptance, “well, now it looks sort of normal.”<br />
<br />
‘But it looks WRONG now,’ his conscience hissed back at him.<br />
<br />
Ethan shook his head and clomped down the stairs. At least it was Saturday, and he could relax and stay home. If Ethan had paid better attention, however, he would have noticed the feeling of his underwear rubbing against his scruffy, dirty blonde treasure trail slowly fade away until the sensation had gone entirely. The skin of his abs now looked completely smooth, except for the thin, platinum blonde vellus hairs, nearly invisible to the eye.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Eric reclined in bed, slowly working the head of his pale white dick in and out of his mouth, his tongue slowly swirling around it as pre-cum oozed onto it. His black bangs tickled his eyes as his head stretched forward.<br />
<br />
‘Yum….’ He sighed to himself. ‘Pineapple DOES improve the flavor,’ he chuckled to himself as the blonde pubes tickled his nose. Then, he grew serious when he felt his egg-sized balls tighten up while the base of his shaft began to contract with rhythmic throbbing. In seconds, the cum went flying up the eight-inch shaft and straight down his gullet. ‘Mmm,’ it made an audible pop as it slipped from his mouth. “That feels frickin’ amazing; I don’t know why Eth doesn’t want this thing back; it feels AMAZING! I love my dick,” he sighed with content as he patted it with affection.<br />
<br />
Eric laid back on his bed, grabbed the remote to his tv. But, before he turned it on, he took a moment to admire his deep golden tan and smiled. Then, with the press of a button, Saturday morning cartoons replaced his reflection, distracting him as he flicked from channel to channel. Unbeknownst to him, the thick bush of golden-blonde pubes that framed his dick slowly darkened, going from dirty-blonde to light brown before turning black in the dim lighting. As he lounged back on his pillow, his dick shifted. With each slight throb matching in time with his heartbeat, the skin of his cock slowly turned a shade darker, going from pale cream to a light tan, before settling on a bronze hue that perfectly matched the rest of Eric’s skin.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Ethan had finished putting together some sandwiches and had called for Eric to come to help himself. He did, but he didn’t linger, quickly running back to his room and closing the door to his room to ensure privacy. ‘Dang, he’s getting addicted to that dick. I swear he’s played with it more in the last two weeks than I have in a year.”<br />
<br />
‘A sign that perhaps you weren’t meant to have such a dick. More of a burden to you than anything else,’ his conscience whispered. His tiny dick throbbed in agreement. <br />
<br />
Ding dong! The doorbell interrupted his thoughts. Ethan frowned as he approached the door and opened it. ‘Who could that be this early in the morning? Oh, fudge…’ <br />
<br />
As it swung out, the face of an awkwardly smiling Haylee greeted him. She twiddled her fingers as she looked into his eyes. “Oh, uhm, Haylee. Hi,” Ethan stuttered. He shook his head as if trying to shake off his awkwardness. “How are you?”<br />
<br />
Haylee eagerly glomped onto the question, stepping into his personal space as she answered, “I’m good. Yeah, good.” She leaned in close and asked, “uhm, would you mind letting me in, I need to say a few things, and I don’t want to say them, ‘out here’” she said the last part with a forced whisper.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s eyes widened as he stepped aside and gestured to the back hall that led to his room. “Yeah, yeah, Haylee, sure.”<br />
<br />
Once, they found themselves nestled in the privacy of Ethan’s room. She went in for a quick peck on the lips, which evolved into an epic make-out session.<br />
<br />
Only when she pulled back for a moment did Ethan’s brain, drowning in sex, finally kick into gear. He slowly blinked his eyes as he held Haylee an arm’s distance from her by the shoulders. “While I really enjoyed that,” he did, his little boner throbbed in agreement. “You’re giving me mixed messages, and I don’t want to step over any lines.”<br />
<br />
Haylee went pale as she smiled ruefully and patted Ethan on the shoulder reassuringly. She looked down to the bed in the space between them. “I’m sorry about yesterday, Ethan. I just got surprised. I mean, I was working on that cute little guy of yours. And all of a sudden, I couldn’t breathe; I was choking. And your hand was on my head, and I couldn’t back off. I panicked!”<br />
<br />
Ethan grimaced as he sagged, “I didn’t mean to, I just lost myself in the feelings, and I didn’t know my brother was going to pull the old switcheroo at the time.”<br />
<br />
Haylee’s face went a bit cross for a second,” well, I thought at the time that you were trying to pull a fast one on me, make me miserable. But,” she lifted a hand to hold off his rebuttal. “That wasn’t the case. I just lost myself in my emotions. And the other thing was…” a blush went across her features before she admitted shyly, “I wanted to have a go at your big dick, Ethan. No, I’m serious,” she insisted as he looked at her with a raised eyebrow. “Ever since I met you two years ago, and I bumped into you coming out of the boy’s locker room, and I saw what you were packing down there; I just kept fantasizing what it would have been like to play with it, hold it, even just to watch as it throbbed with need.”<br />
<br />
Ethan blushed as she continued to confess her inner thoughts. “And then, when I finally had my chance, it scared the heck out of me. It was MORE than I ever thought it would be; it scared me.”<br />
<br />
Ethan scooted closer and gently wrapped his arms around her, and she gave into the embrace. He whispered into her ear, “Hey, it’s alright. No harm, no foul. I understand, Haylee.”<br />
<br />
She sighed as she reclined against his front - she froze, and then he froze. She shifted her butt back and forth against his crotch. Finally, she turned to look back at him and raised an eyebrow with a slight smirk on her face. Ethan’s eyes went wide as her hand slowly skittered down his taut torso, between his smooth belly and underwear, before reaching inside. Then, she pulled out; Ethan’s crotch seemed to deflate as she held out the balled-up pair of socks.<br />
<br />
‘Busted!’ His conscience snickered in the corner of his mind while his pecker oozed a drop of pre-cum. Ethan blushed as Haylee’s grin deepened, “and what do we have here?”<br />
<br />
“Uhm, about that, you see, I uhh.” Ethan’s words failed him as Haylee threw the ball aside, reached for the button to his jeans, and popped it open while slipping the zipper down. Unfortunately, the underwear slipped down with the zip, which caused his eagerly throbbing nub to pop into view, another drop of pre-cum just starting to form from the slit.<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” she snickered before leaning down and blowing on it, causing Ethan to jump on the bed. “And what happened to your dick, BIG BOY?”<br />
<br />
Ethan had an awkward smile on his face as he rubbed the back of his neck, “see, I kind-of, sort-of, pissed off my little bro. I chewed him out for swapping our dicks, so he set things to rights,” he temporized. “And now he won’t swap it back….”<br />
<br />
Haylee snickered as he shook her head; she glanced down at his hand and saw the band of gold around his ring finger. “Why do you need your brother’s permission? It’s your dick, not to mention you have the swapping ring on YOUR finger. Just snap your fingers and do it if you want.” <br />
<br />
He cringed as his blush deepened, and then she froze again. Then he confirmed her understanding with the words, “I tried.” Her eyes went wide as he quickly explained, “the ring only allows changes that the wielder wants.”<br />
<br />
“So since you can’t manage to swap back,” Haylee left her statement dangling.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked to the bed with a look of resigned acceptance, “I want THIS,” he cupped his tiny package, making another drop of pre-cum in response.<br />
<br />
Haylee rubbed her chin, deep in thought. “Eric swapped your stuff back despite your feelings; why doesn’t he override you? Let him take the ring, snap his fingers, and presto, everyone’s back to the way they were.”<br />
<br />
Ethan frowned as he explained, “I kind of told him off yesterday, so he swapped us. And when he figured out that I liked being this way, he explained how he liked how things stood too. But, something’s different, Haylee, I can’t put my finger on it. Before he gave the ring back to me, he told the ring to swap us back, and it didn’t.”<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t work for either of you?” She asked.<br />
<br />
Ethan shook his head and patted his crotch, “not for this at least.”<br />
<br />
Haylee gave him a reassuring smile, “it’s okay, Ethan, we’ll figure something out. And even if we don’t…” her words trailed off as her pointer finger and thumb gently collared his nub. He sucked in a breath between his teeth as she tenderly worked it up and down. “I ALSO like you this way.”<br />
<br />
The declaration made Ethan groan deep and low before gasping. For all the sound the young man made, Haylee would have thought she was about to get peppered by cum. But, instead, a few drops of watery cum found themselves languidly ejected from the head of his tiny dick.<br />
<br />
When he caught his breath, he looked up at her and smiled as she leaned forward and gave him a gentle kiss on the lips. Then, when she pulled back, he sighed, “I’m the luckiest guy in the WORLD,” His voice went from a deep tenor to a squeaky pre-teen countertenor.<br />
<br />
The two of them looked at each other with looks of surprise. Ethan cleared his throat and cautiously spoke, he sagged with relief, “I haven’t heard my voice crack like that in years.”<br />
<br />
Haylee tittered behind a hand, “you sounded like someone who just inhaled a helium balloon for a second there.”<br />
<br />
Ethan shrugged with a calm expression while his thoughts ran like crazy on a shaky hamster wheel. “It was just a FLUKE,” his voice cracked again, followed by a racking cough.<br />
<br />
Haylee watched Ethan with worry written on her face. “Uhm, Ethan, I don’t think that was a fluke.”<br />
<br />
When Ethan finally managed to hold his breath and restrain his coughs, he reached over to the nightstand, took a drink of water, and sighed with relief. “It’s fine,” his voice remained locked in its higher register. <br />
<br />
Ethan thumped his chest, cleared his throat, and went through a couple of singing exercises his choir teacher usually had them do to warm up. “Me May Mah Mo Moo…” each syllable came out in a clear bell-like tone. “My voice…” he whimpered, sounding more like a pre-pubescent boy than a young man on the verge of adulthood.<br />
<br />
Haylee put her hands reassuringly on his shoulders and had him recline back against his pillow, and said, “it’s okay, Ethan, deep breaths, we will figure this out.”<br />
<br />
“How!” His higher voice accentuated the panic he felt inside. “It’s one thing when I was only packing a tiny pecker; I can always hide that if I wanted to. But this?!” He gestured to his throat as he keened in dismay.<br />
<br />
Haylee insisted as she put one of her hands in the middle of his chest, “when you speak, I want you to put some effort into controlling your voice. Feel your throat tighten and speak from your chest, don’t use your head voice.”<br />
<br />
Ethan took in a deep breath and then spoke soft and slow, “testing, one two three…” his voice came out in a measured tone, nearly identical to normal, but sounding forced, rather than natural. “It’s almost right… but this is such a PAIN.” The moment he got a little excited and didn’t apply complete focus to it, his voice cracked and returned to a child-like tone. <br />
<br />
Haylee patted him on the shoulder, “this getting out of hand. I’m going to have a chat with your brother and get this all ironed out.”</p>
