<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hello, my name is David Reece.  I’m 24 years old, have tan skin, slicked back brownish, black hair, am wearing a white T-shirt, as well as light <br />
brown cargo pants.  I’m also 6-1, played high school basketball, walked on to play college basketball a few years, and then walked on to play <br />
college football the last two years.  I was a shooting guard both in high school and college, and played the point part time.  In football, I was a <br />
wide receiver, but seldomly found the field.<br />
<br />
Currently, I work as a personal trainer, and I’m an aspiring bodybuilder.  I’m only 210 pounds, but mostly I’m all muscle, and I work on my <br />
body relentlessly.  I sspend most of my days getting huge and teaching people, as I tell them how to work out and how to eat right.<br />
<br />
I give nutritional advice, but I rarely heed my own advice in my own free time.  I just work out a lot, eat a lot, and work out some more again.  I <br />
do wonder what it’d be like to be in the CIA, or the Secret Service, that’d be cool.  I feel like I can be a trained bodyguard, especially since I’m <br />
that someone with that specific skill set.<br />
<br />
Every once in a while, I hook up with ladies for a screw, and it’s quite nice.   There are perks and benefits to having such a great body and to <br />
being a trainer.  I help them….and let’s just say, they help me, too. <br />
<br />
It’s kinda nice being the first guy who they ask for a date, well, more or less a screw.  I’d just say I’m a natural, because I’ve worked on my bod, <br />
and my personality to get the ladies to flock to me.  There’ve been so many days where I’ve had a couple drinks, a screw, and then some more <br />
drinks to the point where I just may be a borderline alcoholic.  But I like my life.  I have no complaints, and I just love having a good , fun time.<br />
<br />
Right now, I’m entering the gym to check in to work.<br />
<br />
My colleague and friend, Ben Wong comes to greet me.  He’s 23, 5-10, and works the front desk for the fitness center I work for.  He’s a pretty <br />
good friend of mine, and I mostly hang out with during the work hours.<br />
<br />
Next to him is Rachel Goodwin, who is a slender 5-8 tall woman, aged 22, and has luscious dark brown hair, and C cup breasts.  She’s fit and <br />
pretty muscular, but also is good looking too.  Definitely, she can outrun most average dudes on the street, I’d say, and she definitely has more <br />
strength than a gawky teenager.<br />
<br />
Then on the right are Bruce and Beth Calloway.  They are 21 years old, and are twin siblings.  Bruce is 5-11, has light brown hair, has a gangly, <br />
scrawny looking appearance as well as long arms, and also makes the most jokes.  Beth has blonde hair, with some brown highlights, is fairly <br />
muscular, is 5-9, and also works the front desk.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I come in to greet them<br />
<br />
Ben says to me, “Hey David.”<br />
<br />
I say to him, “Hey Ben.”<br />
<br />
I say to them, “So guys, what’s new?”<br />
<br />
Bruce says, “We’ve got a famous person coming in.  Today, we’ll have to lock down the basketball courts to make sure we host this event <br />
today.”<br />
<br />
I say to him, “Who do we have today?  Carrie Underwood?  Scarlett Johansson?  Natalie Couglin?  I’m intrigued.”<br />
<br />
Bruce says cheekily, “Nice joke, Dave.  But we’ve got a dude coming in.  Keep guessing.  The ladies love him in such a way that maybe he may <br />
steal your thunder.”<br />
<br />
I keep guessing.  I say, “Well, hopefully we get someone good coming. In, like Christian Bale, or Mark Wahlberg.  Or what about Will Ferrell?”<br />
<br />
Ben says, “Nope.  We’ve got Jay Heaps.”<br />
<br />
Rachel says cooingly, “Oh, I love Jay Heaps!  It’d be so cool to meet him!!!”<br />
<br />
Four more workers come in to listen to the conversation.  Earl Stallings, Melissa Stevens, Olivia Sampson-Lee, and Jess Sura.  Earl is a 28 year <br />
old, 5-6 tall, African American man with black hair, a hefty build, and also has a big, bushy beard.  He’s easily excitable, and also has <br />
something of a Napoleon complex.  <br />
<br />
Melissa is a pretty, 5-4 tall blonde with C cup breasts, is quite skinny, who runs like Maggie Grace in Taken 2.  She’s very pretty, is quirky, and <br />
can be funny, but also serious sometimes.  I’d say I’m pretty close with her, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Olivia is a 5-5, black haired woman who possesses tan skin.  She possesses B cup breasts, is of Asian descent, and is very happy pretty much <br />
all of the time.  He’s pretty cute, and I love her company when she’s around.<br />
<br />
Jess Sura is a 5-6, very slender dude who possesses dark brown hair, and a very slim build.  He’s probably the shyest person I’ve worked with, <br />
but he’s a nice guy.  I haven’t seen him much at the locker room, as he mostly keeps to himself at the gym after work hours.  I must say, he <br />
likes his space.<br />
<br />
He always goes by Jess, and sometimes, “Jess Sur,” pronounced like Yes sir when Pharrell says it, but with a J, but we all know that his full first <br />
name is Jesse.  By far, he’s the skinniest dude here, and easily could be confused as a transman, as some of the ladies have remarked how <br />
attractive he is, are very close to him, and may be the most feminine looking, peculiar man I've worked with.  But he definitely probably has a <br />
lot more strength than how he looks, and is quite protective of his features and body.<br />
<br />
Melissa says as she tugs my arm in a pleasant tenor of a voice, “He’s so hot.  He’s kind of got this punky, hip hop vibe, and he just looks like a <br />
rocker that will steal the show.  David, you’ve got competition!”<br />
<br />
I say to her half-jokingly, “No one can be as good looking as me.  No offense, Jess.”<br />
<br />
Jess says, “None taken.”<br />
<br />
Earl says to Jess, “Jesssur!”<br />
<br />
Jess laughs, as he says meekly, “Hehe, yup.  Jessur.”<br />
<br />
I say to Melissa, “Who is this Jay Heaps, and what does he have that I don’t have?”<br />
<br />
Melissa laughs as she says, “He’s an Internet sensation.  He’s a male model, and he’s got a certain, sexy panache that would be sexy on a <br />
gawky teenager.  I’d do him.”<br />
<br />
I said to her, “Oh, no you didn’t.  I think I’ll definitely be better looking than him.”<br />
<br />
Beth says, “Wait ‘til you see him.  I’ve studied his website, and his videos, and I think our place will be packed with people.”<br />
<br />
Olivia responded with eager happiness, “I heard he was pansexual, and a vegan.  He makes these funny faces, and he’s got such a strong <br />
stance on being pro-feminism and animal rights, I just love it!”<br />
<br />
I said to her, “Whoa.  That definitely seems like a much different type of guy than I’m used to meeting.”<br />
<br />
Earl retorts, &quot;Well, Olivia, you just made him sound like a chick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Olivia laughs, as she says, &quot;He is not a chick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa replies as she goes on to say sternly, &quot;Yep, I concur with Olivia's assessment.  No dude that good looking would be biologically a chick, <br />
right?  Oh, I want his babies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben smiles as he says, &quot;Well, Earl is just joking when he said that, right?  We all know he's a dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Earl laughs as he says, &quot;Yup.  I do think it's weird that he considers himself a vegan, a staunch feminist, and is 'pansexual.'  I do think that's <br />
weird.  Just sayin'.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa reprimands him, as she says, &quot;Earl!  C'Mon.  Don't be an ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
Earl laughs and he replies, &quot;Sorry.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Beth replies happily, &quot;Well, I can't wait to meet him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel replied as a matter of factly, “Well, that should be fun.  Can’t wait to meet him.  It'd be really inspiring to see him at his craft doing <br />
work.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the manager comes back.  He's 5-9, also has a bushy beard, as it is dark brown, and has quite the hefty build.  <br />
<br />
The manager, Jimmy Abercrombie, says, &quot;Alright everybody!  Break's over.  Everybody back to work!&quot;</p>
