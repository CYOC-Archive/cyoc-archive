<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had to move quickly if they were going to make it by the guard change.<br />
<br />
And moving quickly was their specialty.<br />
<br />
The 6-member Free Lithuanian Partisan squad had recently formed, but all of its members, despite their appearances, had a good deal of prior military experience, or a tough background.<br />
<br />
They had succeeded fully in their past three missions, and had made a name for themselves among their allies . . . and enemies.  More than half of the squad were transformees, so they had to keep their heads down.<br />
<br />
Now their job was to sabotage as many vehicles as they could at this Homeland Union outpost.  The 5 members going in each had 4 bombs - refashioned mines made to stick - they were effective, but took a bit of time to arm.<br />
<br />
How far it had fallen - of all the possible names of the political parties he had decimated, Jokubas Cipkas chose the Homeland Union&#39;s name to be the all-seeing, all-powerful entity in Lithuania.<br />
<br />
And its name was yelled and shouted everywhere by soldiers and HU-supporting partisans alike as they patrolled the streets, beating, arresting, and stealing from the transformed.<br />
<br />
But that was before.  Now, they were killing any mutants they could see.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t the paranoid fear that the global 4 weeks of unrest had centered around - it was pure evil.<br />
<br />
In no time - 10 bombs were quietly planted, entirely undetected, on armored vehicles, mobile artillery, and a tank, all sitting ducks while under repairs in their garages.  The outpost was small, but there were still a good number of enemy troops stationed there.<br />
<br />
10 left.<br />
<br />
Estela had planted her last explosive and was signalling back to Kamile and Adomas, who, with their shared arm, silently signaled that they had just 1 left.<br />
Armin had 2 left.  Kati was out of sight - as usual.<br />
<br />
Estela ducked under the vehicle she had just laid a mine on as a guard patrol walked by.  They were joking about their kills - one boasted how they had taken out a pair of conjoined twins with a single headshot, and the other proclaimed he had the highest number of Harpy kills in his unit - the many feathers of different colors, some bloody, that adorned his helmet were perhaps evidence of this outrageous proclamation.<br />
<br />
Estela grit her teeth and slowed her breathing.  She had to remain calm, even though those bastards were within knife-killing distance.<br />
She wasn&#39;t outwardly a mutant - she looked just like a normal, albeit muscular, young woman.  However, she had &quot;gained age&quot; from the Transformation Wave - she relaly was only 13 years old.<br />
<br />
She had tried living under cover in the cities, until the Homeland Union army killed her father.<br />
She had fled with her mother and brother, both more mutated than she was, and volunteered to join the Free Lithuanian Partisans in their fight against Cipkas&#39; regime, and to end his anti-mutant genocide.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they passed, and Estella breathed a quick sigh of relief.  Raising her head, she noticed a locked garage.  It was adorned with multiple signs that stated there were biohazards within, and it had no windows.<br />
<br />
A . . . Chemical weapon?<br />
<br />
Estela signed to Armin that she was going to check the building out.  He nodded and left with Kamile and Adomas to notify Petre that everyone had placed their explosives, and to prepare a getaway.<br />
<br />
Kati was staying back to help/aid/and cover her - she momentarily made her face visible as she smiled at Estela, who hated when she took uneccesary risks like that.  She was sitting, invisible, on the top of the garage.<br />
<br />
Estela moved quickly around the backs of the garages, testosterone flowing through her veins.  She made a dash and hid underneath a guard tower, then buried covered herself in as much snow as she could to avoid a group of UP-aligned partisans transporting some crates or ammunition.  After a minute, she popped out and ran to the side door of her target garage.<br />
<br />
It was electronically locked, but no matter - a little C4 would do wonders.<br />
<br />
The sound would make the enemy suspicious, so Estela only had a minute to snap some photos of the potential weapons of destruction housed inside.<br />
<br />
Taking cover as the door blew, Estella rushed in, mounted flashlight equipped, and was greeted by the unmistakable smell of musk and sex.<br />
<br />
It was pitch black, so after she found the switch, Estela illuminated the silent garage with a dim yellow light.<br />
<br />
She was taken aback.<br />
<br />
The frame of the thing was covered in smooth but lightly hairy skin - akin to the skin on woman&#39;s legs.<br />
It was veiny and muscular in other places, and it&#39;s treads were made out fingernail and toenail-like plates.<br />
And it&#39;s main cannon looked pretty much like a . . . Penis. <br />
<br />
It was horrifyingly elegant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tankas?&quot;<br />
&quot;. . .&quot;<br />
&quot;Bet gyvena?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before her sat a main battle tank - that looked like it was made from human flesh.</p>
