<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Matt said. &quot;What if it only makes it worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse? How much worse could it get?!&quot; Nick retorted. He was mostly referencing himself. Part of him was still surprised that Matt hadn&#39;t noticed his raging erection. No matter how hard he&#39;d tried to get his blood to flow elsewhere, it seemed to stay planted in his dick making it fully hard. He struggled trying not to touch it. &quot;You know what? How about we buy something for me then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Matt said. &quot;We don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter. Pull up the website,&quot; Nick ordered. &quot;Please.&quot; He added when Matt gave him a look. <br />
<br />
Matt headed towards his computer. &quot;Fine... What do you want to try to order?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot; Nick put his arm around Matt&#39;s wide shoulders and leaned over to see the computer. Matt gave him a bit of a look, but Nick didn&#39;t notice. He was trying to think about something that would make him straight again. Something that&#39;s not too obvious. But finally he just settled on it. &quot;A pocket pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A... Pocket pussy?&quot; Matt&#39;s look grew even more skeptical. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-yeah,&quot; Nick tried to say it with confidence, but he couldn&#39;t overlook Matt&#39;s look. It seemed to be peering into his soul. Like he already knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Matt shook his head, searched for one, and then placed his order. &quot;2 hours and it&#39;ll be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Nick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But a pocket pussy?&quot; Matt asked. That same skeptical look wouldn&#39;t go away. &quot;You know what? Nevermind. Don&#39;t wanna know.&quot; He said then closed down his computer. The two played video games and talked while they waited. The knock on the door caused the two to jump. they&#39;d almost forgotten that they&#39;d ordered something. Matt went to the door and signed for the package. &quot;It&#39;s here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick was close behind. They went to the living room and opened the box. Inside was a six pack of bottled drinks. The large colorful packaging boasted of a brand-new delicious flavor. And how they were jammed packed with Vitamins and Minerals. However, the two stared at it. &quot;This isn&#39;t what we ordered,&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m starting to think that they won&#39;t ever give us what we ordered...&quot; Nick said.<br />
<br />
Matt nodded. He picked up the drink and tried to figure out what it was. The brand was unfamiliar to him and even google had trouble finding it. &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Matt asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink it,&quot; Nick opened one up. However, his nose instantly turned up at it. &quot;Eh! Gross! What the hell is in there?&quot; His body wanted to reject it even at the smell. Quickly he pushed it away and took a step back. <br />
<br />
But to Matt it didn&#39;t smell bad at all. If anything, almost good. It was a mixed fruity smell that seemed to call him. &quot;It&#39;s not that bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick leaned forward again, taking another whiff. &quot;Fuck that man. That shit stinks!&quot; His nose turned up. &quot;If you think it smells so good then you drink it. It&#39;s your idea after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt felt his stomach sink. He didn&#39;t know what this was. But his mouth started watering at the smell. Something about it sent off all kinds of signals that he should drink it, despite him never tasting it before. This only doubled his worry. &quot;F-fine,&quot; he answered. It couldn&#39;t be worse than what was already happening to him. So, he popped the cap and then tipped it back.<br />
<br />
The taste was better than he expected. Sweet and savory with a thickness to it that he just didn&#39;t want to stop. It slid down his throat easily. Matt breathed through his nose as he finished the bottle. &quot;Woah! That tasted great!&quot; he said. Suddenly he felt incredibly full. Like he wouldn&#39;t want to eat for a while. He looked up at Nick. Then giggled. &quot;Woah... Did you work out again?&quot; <br />
<br />
Nick twisted his head slightly but had a smile on his face as he looked at his friend incredulously. &quot;No?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Cause you look so much bigger,&quot; Matt said. But it was the fact that he was steadily starting to shrink. An inch in his height disappeared, followed quickly by another. He had to really tilt his head back to look at his friend. But the same was happening to his muscles. Slowly they were starting to disappear. They thinned out and the shirt he was wearing was far larger on him than it had been before. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt almost felt a bit drunk as he walked forward. His feet naturally stepped out of his shoes. &quot;You just look so much bigger,&quot; he said as one of his hands groped Nick&#39;s thick chest. His body leaned in, laying his head there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you finally coming out?&quot; Nick chuckled.<br />
<br />
However, Matt didn&#39;t hear him. He was far too distracted with his own hormones to realize what he was doing. His instincts had taken over and he slowly dropped his hands lower and lower. They slid over Nick&#39;s firm abs and then gripped onto the flexible shorts Nick was wearing. Then Matt dropped down, just like the shorts. His face was directly in line with Nick&#39;s thick dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess so,&quot; Nick tried to look over his pec shelf, but could barely see Matt below him. That didn&#39;t mean he couldn&#39;t feel the other man&#39;s tongue running up and down his cock though. Nick quickly grew hard. Feeling his friend&#39;s mouth surround his dick was something else. He let out a deep guttural grunt, and gripping whatever he could to hold on. &quot;Man! You&#39;re really good at this!&quot; Nick&#39;s hand quickly went to the top of Matt&#39;s head, only encouraging him more.<br />
<br />
Matt was in another world as he suckled the cock. It felt so much better than he ever expected. The salty taste and musky smell only made his own dick throb with excitement. And with the hand on the back of his head, he wasn&#39;t going to stop. The subtle encouragement only made it all the better as he brought his mouth back and forth, tasting the hearty meat in his mouth. He moaned with pleasure and each time Nick&#39;s body shivered, he knew he was doing something right. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Nick goaded. He was starting to lose control. Matt&#39;s expert mouth only made it that much harder to think about anything else. &quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; he belted out. And with that he felt his body cum. Large swaths shot off cum shot out his dick and straight down Matt&#39;s mouth. His body jerked back and forth several times before he was able to come off that high. &quot;Woah... You&#39;re really good at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt smiled at the complement. He&#39;d swallowed without second thought. And it wasn&#39;t until he stood up that he realized how much of a mess he&#39;d made in his own pants that he realized something was wrong. &quot;Shit!&quot; he looked down. &quot;Did I..?&quot; he wanted to be revolted but it only turned him on again as he saw Matt&#39;s softening dick. That taste stayed in his mouth, and he desired it. &quot;I... I... I can&#39;t believe I did that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon big guy,&quot; Nick said. &quot;It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s not like no one figured it out anyways.&quot; He quickly pulled his friend in for a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Fear in Matt&#39;s voice quickly doubled as he felt his head lean against Nick&#39;s chest. He was standing completely upright, yet he barely came up to the other man&#39;s shoulders. He pushed away, looking Nick over. &quot;Did... Did you grow again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Uhh... No?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s eyes turned to the rest of the room. Suddenly everything seemed bigger. Like he wasn&#39;t looking down on it as much anymore. Then he turned his eyes on himself. &quot;Shit! What the hell!&quot; Looking over his body he was far thinner than he had been. No longer was he the massive football player he had been. His large shirt that had clung tightly to his upper body, now hung loosely over his smaller body. &quot;I&#39;m smaller...&quot; he mutter, stripping it off. <br />
<br />
At 5&#39;11&quot; and 180 pounds he wasn&#39;t tiny by any means, but the amount of muscle he had was greatly reduced. He could still see the definition of some muscle, but it wasn&#39;t the same as his big and bulky body had been. His body was lean. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening...&quot; he whimpered.<br />
<br />
But Nick brought the other man into a warm hug. &quot;It&#39;s alright big guy. You&#39;re fine...&quot; his warm voice eased Matt&#39;s worries. <br />
<br />
Matt felt himself pull into the hug, resting his head against the thick chest that he was now level with. He bit his lower lip. It felt good.</p>
