<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monique finally finished all of her duties around 12:30 AM.  The party had ended about an hour earlier.  She had to do all the cleanup herself.  Luckily for her, the people at the party had been relatively neat.  Brad offered to stay and help, as had Joey, but she told them to go join their friends having fun somewhere else.<br />
<br />
She had to admit that Joey's tricks were pretty funny.  First he gave Mrs. Bockman a pig's nose and hooved feet, then turned her into a full cow for a few minutes.  Whatever kind of trick that was, it was pretty darn good.  He changed a few more of Brad's annoying friends around, then returned them to normal.  He was really good as a magician.<br />
<br />
Too bad, Monique thought to herself as she returned to her small room inside the house, that Joey wasn't a little older.  He was such a gentleman, and really cute, too.  But she was 24 and he was only 18.  Not only that, but she knew Brad was attracted to her.  Even though she knew his parents would never let her date him, she couldn't hurt Brad's feelings by ever looking at a friend of his.  <br />
<br />
She wished she actually had a personal life.  This job was only one step up from slavery.  She earned a wage that was somewhat decent, but having to be at the beck and call of the people in this house limited any time she might have for herself.  <br />
<br />
Monique walked into her room.  As if it could even be called a room.  It was more like hole in the wall.  She had a small bed, with a small nighttable and a small dresser.  Her closet was also very tiny.  There was a decent sized mirror that hung over the dresser.  She had bought that with money that she had saved over the last two years.  <br />
<br />
She kicked off her shoes as she sat down on the bed.  She unhooked her black, lace pantyhose from her short skirt and slid them off her legs.  She was changing into her normal sleeping attire: absolutely nothing.  Hey, after all, she was French.  She stepped back up to lock the door of the room.  Meanwhile she tugged her maid dress off her shoulders and down her arms.  She pulled it off her breasts, and anyone present would have seen her large breasts exposed to the open air.  She pulled the dress off the rest of her body and picked it up off the floor.  She then slid down her black panties and stood in her room stark naked.  She put her clothes in the corner of her room with the rest of her dirty laundary.  She opened the closet to make sure that she had another dress clean for tomorrow.  Before she did that, she fully opened her window, in order to let the warm, summer air enter her room for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Satisfied that she did, she went back to her dresser and looked at herself in the mirror.  Monique felt very insecure about her body.  When she first moved to America four years ago, she felt that there was no doubt she would make it as a model in America.  But for whatever reason she didn't, and now she was stuck in a job that was very humiliating.  Because of this job, she didn't have time to work out like she did in France.  Her rejection from modeling agencies also hurt her self-esteem.  Everyone in France said she was beautiful and that she would make it.  But she did not.  She looked at herself in the dimly lit room and wanted to cry.<br />
<br />
Just as a tear began to fall from her eye, she felt a small prick in her right hand.  She opened her fist and saw a small spot of blood on her palm.  What the hell? she thought.  Then she looked closer at her fingernails and saw that they appeared to be longer than usual.  Not only that, but their normal red color couldn't be seen.  They were black!  And her nails were growing longer!<br />
<br />
Monique opened her hands wide and could see the nails extending from her fingers.  What was going on?  She wanted to scream but found herself unable to.  Her lengthening nails quickly became the least of her problems.  Her hands were now sprouting fine, black hairs.  They were coming out of every follicle, enveloping her hand in complete black.  She turned her hands over and saw what appeared to be leathery pads forming on her palms.  They looked like what you would find on a dog's paws.<br />
<br />
She looked at herself in the mirror, terror on her face.  She stared at her image and her horror grew.  Her eyes were no longer soft blue.  They were glowing bright yellow.  Her mouth opened, again ready to scream, but again she could not.  It was as if something had silenced her vocal chords.  Her attention, however, was focused more on the inside of her mouth.  Her canine teeth were lengthening too!  In fact, it appeared that a good portion of her teeth were growing sharp and pointed.  She opened her mouth wider and saw the changing of each one of her teeth.<br />
<br />
Monique looked back down at her changing hands and saw that they were almost totally covered in hair.  The hair on her head seemed to be growing wildly.  It snarled itself into tight locks, becoming twisted.  She felt a twinge in her ears.  Carefully she placed her clawed hand on her ear and felt the tip of her ear growing pointed as well.  Not only that, but she felt her ears changing position.  They were moving up her head!  Soon she felt her ears settle on the top of her head.  She could see them poking out through her snarled mane of hair.  <br />
<br />
Monique felt a prick on her shoulders.  She looked and saw that tiny black hairs were now growing on her body.  They started to appear on her arms, legs, and stomach.  She could feel them on her back as well.  She looked down at her crotch and saw her pubic hair growing wildly in all directions.  It was tangling and snarling together like the hair on her head, only know it was forming a fine coat of black fur.  <br />
<br />
She now knew what she was becoming: a werewolf.  But she didn't know why.  She tore herself away from the mirror and looked out her window.  The moon was indeed full.  She couldn't understand why this was happening to her.  <br />
<br />
She ran back to the mirror and saw a horrifying sight.  Her arms and legs were totally covered in fur.  Her chest and stomach was almost covered as well.  The fur had not yet grown over her torso.  Now she saw why.  Two sets of nipples had appeared on her chest.  They started to push out, forming two new sets of breasts.  They grew out to C cups, matching her own breasts.  The fur quickly engulfed them, leaving her entire body except for her face covered.<br />
<br />
The coat of fur on her body was quite thick.  She was able to retain enough thought to realize that she looked like the man in An American Werewolf in London before he grew a muzzle.  She wondered if she would have to go through that.  <br />
<br />
Just then a jolt of pain shot up her back.  She turned her head around as best she could and saw something growing just above her ass.  She took her right hand, which looked even more pawlike than before, and felt a bushy tail growing out of her.  Its growth made it harder for her to stand upright.  She was being pushed forward, as if the tail was trying to tell her that she was meant to be on all fours.  She resisted as much as she could, wanting to see what was still to happen.<br />
<br />
Monique looked back at the mirror once more.  She opened her mouth wide, still trying to scream but unable to, and was greeted by a mouthful of razor sharp teeth that looked like they could tear through an entire layer of flesh.  She gazed at her nose and saw that it was turning black, the nostrils flaring out.  She was about to grow a muzzle.  Monique prepared herself as best she could for the pain she was certain was forthcoming.  <br />
<br />
Her mouth started to push out, the skin stretching to the limit.  She opened her mouth as wide as she could, revealing her teeth changing position and growing even larger.  The pain was unbearable.  Still she could not make a sound.  It was now incredibly hard for her to stand.  She could feel her feet growing larger.  She could feel the leathery surface that the bottoms of her feet now possessed.  Still she braced herself against the dresser and tried to keep her eyes open to see her muzzle grow.  It grew out a few inches.  <br />
<br />
The pain that had caused her eyes to close subsided now and she opened them.  They glinted bright yellow, even more so than before.  What she saw horrified her.  There was not once trace of her former beauty present.  She saw only a monster.  If she had been able to cry, she would have.  But the animal was taking over.<br />
<br />
She fell off the dresser and onto her stomach.  The pain of her tail repositioning her body was now too much.  She felt her spinal cord rearrange itself so that she would truly become a four legged creature.  She looked at her hands and saw that they had truly become large paws.  She guessed her feet had done the same, for she now felt them touching the floor flat, just as her hands were.  Her back snapped a few times, and she found herself standing just as a wolf would.<br />
<br />
The creature that was Monique was no more.  Only the beast remained.  It looked around the room for a second and spotted the open window.  It ran up to it and leaped out and down a story, landing on the ground perfectly, and causing no pain to itself.  It looked up at the moon and howled in worship.  In the distance, another howl could be heard.  The female werewolf heard the sound thanks to her heightened sense of hearing, and bounded through the woods in search of what had made the sound.</p>
