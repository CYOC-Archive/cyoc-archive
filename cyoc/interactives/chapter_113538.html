<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Now, Jackie, I want you back from your contest by 4 PM tomorrow, after all Halloween Night is a big night for us lycanthropes, and that means, I want Jeff back to his former self by then too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, mom, I was going to keep Jeff like this.  I set the Chronivac to permanent,&quot; whined Jack.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart would have skipped a beat, if he still had a beating heart.  What the hell had his kid brother done to him?  He was a pumpkin or Jack O&#39;Lantern or something.  It was hard to think whatever he was.   He was hoping he was a Jack O&#39;Lantern already.  He didn&#39;t like the idea of Jack cutting him open and gutting him, if he was a pumpkin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you just turn him back tomorrow at 4:00 PM.  Besides he hates hunting down and eating neighbors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate to spoil the surprise, but we&#39;re not eating at home tomorrow.  We&#39;re going out for Vegan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vegan?  We&#39;re eating vegetables for Halloween dinner,&quot; whined Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, of course not.  Outside of Waverly, some cult has opened a Vegan Commune.  We&#39;ll be eating Vegans.  Strictly organic fed humans for my family this Halloween.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, I kind of think Jeff would prefer a sheep,&quot; Jack said softly.<br />
<br />
Jeff was agreeing.  He hadn&#39;t considered that he would be a werewolf logically if his mother was one.  He should have specified that she had been bitten and become a werewolf, but her offspring weren&#39;t.  No problem, the clock was running down, as her transformation wasn&#39;t permanent.  Everything would be normal after tomorrow.  Or would it?  Jack hadn&#39;t existed, so he should disappear tomorrow, and then Jeff would never have been a gourd.  But Jack had made Jeff&#39;s transformation permanent, would that take precedent?  Jeff didn&#39;t want to be a gourd forever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are those kids, and your dad?   I howled for them five minutes ago,&quot;  Lauren reached inside her tight halter top blouse and pulled out a dog whistle.  She blew it.   Jack covered his ears with his furry claws,  and Jeff&#39;s ears felt like they were going to bleed.  Oh, right, he didn&#39;t have ears.<br />
<br />
The sound of racing feet could be heard on the back step.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, you promised not to blow that thing,&quot; said a nine foot three inch monster of an Anthropomorphic red hairy wolf wearing only Addidas running pants which hung down just below his knees.  &quot;I was practicing hunting with the kids for tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma, I got Miss Taylor&#39;s cat!&quot; said a seven foot wolf girl wearing a bloodied white fur hat on her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH, NATHAN!  What did I tell you about hunting pets!  There are plenty of rabbits, squirrels, pheasants and deer to hunt around here,&quot; sighed Lauren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re going to be hunting the neighbors tomorrow, anyway,&quot; Nathan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;re not,&quot; said Lauren softly.<br />
<br />
Everyone froze.  Jeff was freaking all those big hairy monsters were his siblings.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...counting himself that would be 11?<br />
<br />
Then everyone started yammering and snarling at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot;<br />
&quot;GRRRRR!&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not eating live humans for Halloween?&quot;<br />
&quot;Errrr!&quot;<br />
&quot;Say it ain&#39;t so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, what are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m tired of moving after each Halloween, and the mobs with silver bullets and swords, and all that.  So Emily and I found this lovely cult commune over by Waverly.  All organic fed Vegans, so we decided to surprise our families, and go out for Halloween this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wanted to sink my teeth into that stuck up Ethan Vladice this year,&quot; whined one a ten foot tall male werewolf.<br />
<br />
Lauren was completely wolfed out now, Jeff noticed.  He hadn&#39;t considered how many teats a wolf had  until he saw them sticking out below his mother&#39;s halter top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeremy!  What have I told you about eating the undead?  You would be sick for weeks if you ate that Vampire boy Ethan.  You know vampires really creep me out, I don&#39;t know why the Vladices keep him in high school still.  He was at High School when your father and I were your age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, honey, you know Ethan&#39;s always had a crush on you.  That&#39;s why his family keeps moving to wherever we are. As for why his family goes along with it?  I was chatting with his father at the Blue Moon Tavern the other night, and well, they don&#39;t have a choice.  Seems Ethan is the head vampire of their clan, he turned his parents and siblings into vampires, so they have to do what he wants.   You know he&#39;s over 600 years old.  Can you imagine being 16 for that long?  Being in puberty for that long?  I kinda feel sorry for him.  I say we follow Jeremy&#39;s advice, and stake the teenage vamp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your venison&#39;s getting cold.  Say grace, and we&#39;ll talk no more of feuding with the vamps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan bowed his head, and then he raised it in a howl of thanks to the creator for putting prey on their table.  The children and Lauren raised their heads in howl with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, gawd they&#39;re at it again.  I swear, Martha, we ought to move before they eat us in our sleep,&quot; Lonny Chaney said sitting down for dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you complained when we lived downstairs from those bible thumpers in Waverly.  They were always singing or chanting or some such.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they were a Satanic Cult, I&#39;m sure of it.  Did you hear they bought a huge farm outside of Waverly, and turned it into a commune.  Hippy Satanists, I&#39;m sure of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dear, I  don&#39;t know about that.  I thought they were just born-agains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s for dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Venison,  Lauren and I were chatting earlier and she said Nathan had gotten a big buck out hunting, and she had extra. And I know how you love venison.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do love venison, I guess living next door to werewolves does have it&#39;s benefits.  We haven&#39;t had mice in years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, now eat your venison while it&#39;s still hot. I&#39;ve got to get the phone,&quot; Martha said walking toward the ringing phone, &quot;I hate it when people call at dinnertime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s a salesman, tell him to come round to Lauren&#39;s house tomorrow night at 7PM,&quot; Lonny said wickedly grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s enough from you.  Caller ID says it&#39;s Miss Taylor,&quot;  Martha said picking up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Virginia, calm down, your cat-  Oh, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re mistaken - well, children - I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t mean - it was an old cat perhaps they found it dead alr-  no, no, I didn&#39;t - yes, Virginia....&quot;<br />
<br />
Lonny cut into the venison, and took a bite.  I was delicious.  Maybe he should invite Nathan to go hunting with him sometime to get some hunting tips....The image of going hunting with a bloodthirsty 10 foot tall werewolf made Lonny a bit nauseous. He swallowed his regurgitated food, took a drink of water, and continued his dinner trying not to think about his neighbors.</p>
