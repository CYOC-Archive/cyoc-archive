<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica hung up the phone and sighed. “So what I didn&#39;t tell them is that the curse won&#39;t start until I leave you, and I plan on taking you to the perfect place for this curse.” Jessica got up and went to the closet, selecting a pair of stiletto boots she slipped them on and walked their shared body quietly out of the house. The cool night air kissed their bare skin as the mostly naked woman walked to her desired destination, she spoke to Jen as she walked them there.<br />
<br />
“Being a ghost has some perks, I heard you this morning when you said you were glad I was gone. So I guided Kyle to make his decisions today, and while you dealt with the curse he gave you I looked around town. You think I&#39;ll let you get away with three or four pairs of implants being added to you? No, I want them to be huge, I want the results of that story, maybe bigger than that.” Jessica said as she walked them through the quiet streets, their body twitching as Jen tried to fight her for control. “You see, your father had a thing for big fake tits, and he like going to strip clubs behind my back, as if I didn&#39;t know about it. That&#39;s why the implants,” She wobbled their breasts, “Not that I don&#39;t enjoy showing off, but now I get to watch as you live one of my wildest fantasies, and I&#39;m making sure I get the most bang for my buck.”<br />
<br />
Jessica walked through a small wooded area, and into a business district, they had been walking for a half hour now in silence. “We&#39;re going toward the convention center, there&#39;s this expo there right now, yes, right now, even though it&#39;s almost midnight. It&#39;s and adult entertainment expo, you know, porn stars and so on, I&#39;m hoping that there&#39;s a lot of implants there. Beyond that, within the two mile limit, there&#39;s at least one strip club, and a cosmetic surgeon, the hospital might be within the limit but I&#39;m not sure. I want to at least see you with tits the size of beach balls, if not bigger.” Jessica&#39;s body started to twitch and shake more. “Oh you don&#39;t like that huh? Should have thought of that before you opened your mouth this morning.” She got them close to the center and paused, outside were protesters, some were former entertainers as well. “Oh, look at that! You&#39;ll have an audience too!” She messaged her breasts, “I&#39;m sorry girls, Momma doesn&#39;t get to enjoy you at your biggest and best, grow huge for Momma girls, make me proud.” <br />
<br />
Jessica walked them toward the crowd, strutting, one or two took notice and as she got closer all eyes lay upon the naked buxom blonde in heels as she strutted up to the convention center. She got halfway between the crowd and the building and stopped, placing her hands on her hips and presenting herself proudly. “I, JENNIFER SMITH, DO SACRIFICE MY BODY IN PROTEST OF ARTIFICIAL BEAUTY!” She shouted and left their body, Jennifer for the split second she had before the growth began panicked, then her breasts started to grow, bouncing as the implants of the closest women were plucked from their bodies, returning them to their natural size. Quickly zipping past the world record her greedy bust swelled with growth taking more and more from every source in the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
The crowd, first stunned started to cheer as they watched the woman panicking before them, her burgeoning bust now larger than yoga balls, she fell to the ground as they continued to swell. Jen was too busy gasping, the growth was almost orgasmic, and as quickly as it began, it stopped. She lay on top of a pair of beach balls, panting, but the curse wasn&#39;t done, it had just finished with the implants in the two mile radius. What neither Jessica or Jen could realize is that the curse considered unreserved bags of saline as part of the additions, and there were a lot of them in the radius. <br />
<br />
Jen started to try and get up when she heard a low rumbling, her breasts started to grow again as the sound of flowing water came from them, loud creaking could be heard reverberation off of buildings around them. She moaned as her breasts quickly surpassed the beach balls that Jessica had wanted, reaching four feet in diameter they quickly forced Jen to her feet, her moans turned to screams as she watched the massive orbs attached to her grow larger and larger. In seconds her colossal breasts reached five feet in diameter, the massive orbs fought for space against each other, eating up tall available room in front of the screaming woman. The crowd went wild, watching as her ever increasing bust continued to grow at an alarming rate, Jen watched as her world was blocked out by her ever increasing bust, now at six feet in diameter they surged even larger as the crowd started to back up. The creaking and groaning sound now deafening as the unreal scene played out before them. Jen had managed to get her arms around and was beating her breasts with her fists as they finally slowed and stopped, the colossal implants in front of her were now eight feet in diameter, the size of one of those giant novelty beach balls. They pressed together tightly, spread out on her sides, her body pressed against the wall of breast flesh, she looked up and wailed, the massive tits blocked out everything, looming two feet above her head she couldn&#39;t see around them. <br />
<br />
It was just then that the second part of her curse began, she felt them start to get lighter, their mass started to shift, they were lifting up... and closer to her. Jen started to panic as her breasts started to grow closer to her face, they lifted off the ground, their shape shifting, they pressed together, making their unnatural valley of cleavage even larger, their forms squishing together making side and under boob as the invisible bra did it&#39;s work. The crowd cheered as the watched her new burdens shifting so that she could at least walk, looming higher over head she panicked as the wall of tit flesh got uncomfortably close to her face, inch by inch they were hoisted until, satisfied, the bra stopped. <br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s massive eight foot breasts now were lifted by two feet off the ground, Jen looked up and wailed, they were so high above her head, now ten feet above her, her world had been closed off by the massive tits. Mere inches from her face, the wall of tit flesh left little room to move or even breath, she looked left and right seeing the all of tit flesh and little else around her she screamed, pushing and struggling to get away from her new permanent implants. The crowd roared, clapping and cheering for her bravery, they gathered around her, awkward hugs and hands across the vast pair of breasts she now sported made it more apparent what kind of monsters she now carried. She wanted to yell at them, but just went numb, after a few more minutes, new crews arrived on the scene.<br />
<br />
Reporters clamored for an interview with her, she barely knew how to respond to them, and after a few hours she was checked on sight by the paramedics, her parents were called, they were strangely proud of their daughter. And Jen was finally left alone by the time the sun was rising, she shivered, not with anger, but with fear, she could never get rid of these tits, she was stuck like this forever, what was she going to do now? She could swear that she could hear her mother cackling in the distance, how would she do this alone?<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The next morning Kyle and Kelly woke up together and turned on the tv, then gasped, there on the tv was Jen, naked and with a pair of massive eight foot tits, obviously in distress as she stood there numbly answering questions. <br />
<br />
“Fuckin hell.” Kyle said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Kelly responded.<br />
<br />
“Well, you owe me a blow job.” Kyle said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah? And what about her?” Kelly said sharply. “We have to go help her.”<br />
<br />
“How, look at her!”<br />
<br />
“Can she even walk around now? Can she see anything?” Kelly asked, Kyle thought for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
“Cameras.” <br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“We&#39;ve got a few cameras, let&#39;s get them, and that ipad and go to her.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t see where we&#39;re going with this.”<br />
<br />
“Like a back up camera!” Kyle said from the bedroom.<br />
<br />
“Huh, I like it!” <br />
<br />
They quickly got ready and went out the door, walking to the convention center, which wasn&#39;t too far from their house, when they got there they found....</p>
