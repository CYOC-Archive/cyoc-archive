<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was around 3 in the morning when Rachel suddenly woke up, bound,  blindfolded and gagged. She could feel her 4 boobie arms were all being tied together behind her back and her legs were already tied against each other. Aside from her midriff, she couldnt move an inch. What was worse, is that she was suspended in the air. The only thing that gave her a bit of relief was that she quickly figured out that what was binding her, were just Jen&#39;s tentacles.<br />
<br />
Thanks to a slip up, she managed to get a moment of sight which ultimately shocked her. Jen was still fast asleep in her egg-cup bed. Her face was sleeping peacefully on top of her own ass, yet her arms were moving as if they have a will of their own. &quot;Oh god, is she really going to fuck me in her sleep?&quot; Thought Rachel as she tried to wriggle free, but to no avail. <br />
<br />
Suddenly to her suspicion, one of the tentacles found it&#39;s way to her pussy, and slid itself rught inside. Another did the same to her ass too. And one more entered her mouth, doing the same. She could still breath luckily, but that was about the extent of it. Another surprise was that the tentacles were secreting some kind of lubricant too. And this lubricant was possibly making her very aroused too, as the areas it coated, all temporarily became highly sensitive erogenous zones. The tentacles were gentle and didn&#39;t force their way deeper, but slowly moved inwards as the rest pulled her closer and closer to Jen&#39;s body. Then they stopped moving right before she was able to touch her. <br />
<br />
Jen was always a heavy sleeper too, so she likely wouldn&#39;t randomly just wake up either. However by now, Rachel had stopped struggling completely. She wanted these tentacles to keep messing around with her now. It felt so good. Each hole being filled with their own wriggling tentacle was such a unique and amazing feeling. Her ass was stuffed, her belly was full, and even her womb was now bloated, as she now appeared to be pregnant with a tentacle baby. She obviously wasn&#39;t, but from the outside at least, she could easily look the part. <br />
<br />
She could feel her mind slipping into a pleasure filled daze as she went completely limp, letting the tentacles support everything. Since there was no more resistance, the tentacles binding up her limbs moved to her body, letting all 6 of her limbs just dangle limply from her as Rachel was in no good mental state to move them at the moment. They began to massage her 3 boobs instead. Rachel&#39;s eyes rolled back as she just sank deeper and deeper into the pleasure filled fog her mind was quickly becoming. For the next hour, Rachel simply let the tentacles do what they wanted with her body. Everything just felt so good on her now. Even odd parts like her toes and upper abs now sent waves of pleasure through her body with just a touch. <br />
<br />
Sometime durring all of this, Rachel had actually half fallen asleep. It was actually incredibly soothing, like the best massage she has ever received, except all of it was done from within her body instead of externally. A large part of her was now hoping that this wouldn&#39;t just be a one night stand kind of deal either. <br />
<br />
As the sun was rising, Jen&#39;s tentacles, having made Rachel cum for the who knows how many&#39;th time, started pulling out of her slowly and gently. Rachel honestly was kind of sad that it had to end. She was also slowly waking up from her foggy, dazed state. <br />
<br />
She was laid down gently, right next to Jen, on the floor, just as the last bit of tentacle exited her pussy. She was a bit worried about the state of her pussy and asshole, after spending a few hours plugged up by tentacles, but to her surprise, they were perfectly fine, if not even better than before. With a bit of post-daze curiosity, Rachel tugged slightly as her asshole, and to her surprise, it painlessly stretched with her finger. She tried the same with her pussy and sure enough, she could pull her labia apart wide enough to easily slip one of those concrete barrier poles often found in front of shopping centers inside of her with 0 struggle. Hell, Rachel bet she could stuff an entire watermelon into her womb and everyone would simply think she was pregnant. And now she kind of wanted to try it out too. So, while carefully getting up, making sure to not wake the others, Rachel walked into the kitchen and sure enough, there it was. A fresh watermelon just sitting on the counter. <br />
<br />
It was too easy. Rachel just set the large melon down on a chair and sat on it. Her pussy widened around it and swallowed it up with ease, stowing it deep within her; all the way inside of her womb. She looked like she was several months pregnant now, and loved it. She was about to remove it when she got a perfect idea for a prank. With her melon baby safely stashed in her puasy, she hobbled her way back to the other room and lied down where she went to sleep and pretended to be asleep, except that she actually did fall asleep in just under a minute. Roughly 20 minutes later, she was violently shaken awake by 3 very concerned looking girls.</p>
