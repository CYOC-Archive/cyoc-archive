<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">12 year old Steven Smith was for all intents and purposes a normal kid. He had a loving family, plenty of friends and while not smart by any means, had decent 80ish grades. He was even trusted enough by his family to walk to and from school alone. It was only about a ten minute walk to and from and as long as he stayed clear of the abandoned house near the path to school, he was free to do anything he wanted. If there was one flaw he had it was that curiosity got the best of him from time to time. And after several months of being told to stay away from the house, he wanted to sneak a peak. &quot;I mean its abandoned and all. What could really be so dangerous about it?&quot; Steven thought to himself. It was that flaw of his that would soon become fatal. <br />
<br />
Several days of playing will he or won&#39;t he with the house, he finally decided to take the plunge. It was a normal day like no other. Steven decided to pass by the house after school. It was to be his first mistake as his parents wouldn&#39;t be home for several more hours. &quot;Let&#39;s see, let&#39;s see.&quot; Steven said as he got closer to the house. He was able to get up to the gate and look inside. The house looked abandoned at the very least. A lot of the paint had chipped off and the wooden porch was missing several planks of wood. The tall grass was proof that no one had been there for quite some time. &quot;Looks safe to me... Oh.&quot; Steven leaned against the gate and tipped forward. Evidently the gate was open. &quot;I might as well...&quot; He stepped inside. His second mistake. He kept his distance from the porch and looked around. &quot;It really doesn&#39;t look dangerous at all. Or does a hobo leave here maybe?&quot; Steven continued to look around, but there really was nothing there. &quot;Boy, this was a waste of time,&quot; Steven thought as he turned around to leave. His third and final mistake as he no longer noticed someone rise from the all grass and follow him. And just as he was about to exit the gate... &quot;Mmmf!&quot; Someone grabbed him from behind and covered his mouth with a rag. &quot;Mmmf! Hmmf!&quot; Steven tried to struggle, but he found himself getting weaker by the minute. Evidently, the unknown assailant had covered the rag in something. Steven eyes rolled back as he lost consciousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drip... Drip...&quot; After an unknown amount of time, Steven could finally hear something, It was the faint dripping of water nearby. &quot;Wha... Where am I...?&quot; he thought groggily as he struggled to regain his senses. &quot;Ow!&quot; As he did, he felt a sharp pain on his right arm. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Steven thought to himself as he slowly opened his eyes. &quot;Wh... What?!&quot; When he did, he was greeted with an extraordinary sight. He was in a decent sized room made of metal and tile. It looked completely sterile. It was hard to believe he had been near a house that looked like it would collapse. He turned sideways to see an iv drip attached to his right arm. There was nothing inside of the bag at the moment. And what&#39;s more he was naked. Well almost naked. The only thing left on him was his Spiderman undies. His arms and legs were held down by metal restraints as he lay on a metal table. It was just like being in a hospital. He squirmed his body just to see if it was real. <br />
<br />
&quot;Finally awake are we?&quot; Frightened, Steven turned to the voice to see a man in a white coat. His unshaven face and decent sized body made him look like a full grown adult of thirty or so. &quot;I grew tired of waiting.&quot; &quot;Who... Who are you?! What am I doing here?! H-Help!&quot; &quot;Oh now, oh now, oh now!&quot; the man said as he moved towards Steven and squished his cheeks. &quot;Mmngh... Hmmngh&quot; &quot;Silly little boy. We&#39;re under a solid broadsheet of rock and cement. Ain&#39;t no one coming to help you.&quot; The man let go of his face and Steven began to tear up. &quot;Please... I don&#39;t wanna die!&quot; &quot;Oh now, I&#39;m not going to kill you boy! I need you alive for the experiment.&quot; &quot;Sniff... Experiment? Are you gonna dissect me or something?&quot; &quot;My oh my! You&#39;ve been watching too many movies, my boy. I have no need for something so cliche. &quot;Then what are you going to do? Why am I in my undies? And why me?&quot; &quot;Oh so many questions... but since you are my first; oh that sounds quite dirty; since you are my first, I suppose I&#39;ll tell you.&quot; The man moved towards a table and began preparing some liquid. <br />
<br />
&quot;What am I going to do? Well that simple really. I&#39;m going to change your age here and now.&quot; &quot;What?!&quot; Already the conversation had taken a bizarre turn. &quot;But, but that&#39;s impossible!&quot; &quot;Impossible you say?&quot; The man moved towards Steven again, grabbed his nose and shook his head side to side. &quot;Mm,mm,mm!&quot; &quot;You really are like any other human in this world, huh?&quot; He let go and slapped Steven&#39;s face. &quot;Ooof!&quot; &quot;But it IS possible. I&#39;m the proof after all and soon you will be proof too... As for why you&#39;re in your underwear, well if you become to big or too small, you&#39;ll have no need for your clothes anymore, so I threw them out. I&#39;ll at least keep your underwear on though. I&#39;m a scientist, not a pedophile. At least if you grow older, I&#39;ll only see an adult penis. And as for why I chose you, you just simply were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Didn&#39;t your mama ever teach you not to go near strange things, boy?&quot; The man put the finishing touches on whatever he was making. &quot;And now for the final phase.&quot; &quot;Ah! No! No, stay away!&quot; &quot;You&#39;re not the one in charge here boy.&quot; The man said coldly as he open the iv bag. &quot;Please no! I&#39;ll do anything you want! I&#39;ll even get someone else for you! There&#39;s this bully in school! He deserves this more! Please! I don&#39;t wanna be a baby! I don&#39;t wanna be an adult!&quot; But the man paid no heed as he poured the concoction in. Steven tried to shake the needle off, but he was held down tight. And soon enough, the liquid started entering his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnngh! Aghh!&quot; As soon as it entered his arm, it began to feel warm. That warmth soon spread throughout his body from his head to his toes. &quot;Agh! It burns!&quot; &quot;That means its working!&quot; The man let out a small giggle as Steven&#39;s entire body convulsed. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! Uh,uh,uh,uh,uh!&quot; Steven&#39;s body felt the pain of the tonic everywhere. Drool spilled out from his lips and pooled near his cheeks. &quot;Ugh! Uhhh!&quot; Steven struggled to control the pain as he felt the bones in his body start to crack and reshape. His tiny feet grew at an alarming rate. His toes popped out one by one and grew thicker. The musty smell of a jock&#39;s foot filled the air. His hand were the next to grow. As he clenched his fists, hair grew out on the knuckles. His growing fingers pushed out his fist as his fingernails grew a bit. The arms and legs were next as they grew out. They pushed his restraints down and up his arms and legs as his vision moved upwards on the ceiling. &quot;Hmph! Hngh!&quot; Steven grunted as he then exploded with muscle. The restraints adjusted themselves to the new width. His tiny upper body grew up and bulked out forming a growing eight pack and rock hard abs with a decent amount of chest hair. &quot;Hnnnnnnngh!&quot; Steven felt every muscle tighten. It felt like he was going through a grueling workout. He felt like he was about to shit himself, but he held it in. &quot;Gulp! Glegh!&quot; Steven&#39;s neck ovulated as his Adam&#39;s Apple became more pronounced. His face widened and lost its chubbiness. He felt the facial hair growing on his upper lip and chin. His blond hair became a messier shade of blond. His chest hair moved down the middle of his stomach forming a treasure trail to the one area that had yet to transform.<br />
<br />
Steven felt the remaining heat wrap around his penis. &quot;Uh! Uh! Uhhh!&quot; He thrust his pelvis up and down as it felt like he was being kicked in the balls. &quot;Uhh! Uhh! Ah! My pee-pee! My pee-pee is burning! Help!&quot; Steven shouted in his new masculine voice. His pelvis and waist area expanded, straining his underwear to the breaking point. &quot;Hmph!&quot; With one big thrust, the fabric in the underwear snapped just as Steven felt his testicles drop down into his ball sac, filling them up to the size of golf balls. His throbbing penis went erect. The four inch prick vibrated with an intensity twice its current age. &quot;Uhh! Uhh! My pee-pee! Uhhh! My pee-pee is hard! Ahhhh!&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t fight it boy. Let it all out!&quot; Steven could no longer fight it as he pissed out onto the floor. His dick grew and grew as it did so, becoming thicker and thicker. As it grew out to the size of a beer can, his erect penis shot up inch by inch to a respectable 11 inches. As soon as he stopped peeing, Steven&#39;s dick pulsed up and down. &quot;Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! What&#39;s happenahhhhhhhh?!&quot; &quot;Oh my. He&#39;s gonna blow!&quot; The man stepped back a bit. &quot;Uhh! Uhh! Something&#39;s coming! Something... Ahh! UHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; And with one long moan, Steven went through his first ejaculation. His thick dick shot of load after load of cum. After about a dozen seconds or so, he started to stop as his penis returned to about 6 inches flaccid.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And with that, the experiment is a success!&quot; the man shouted triumphantly. Steven let out a sigh as he wondered what would happen to him now.</p>
