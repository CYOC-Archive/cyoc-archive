<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When they reached to the court, Mr. Bouvier and his partner said they&#39;ll warm up with each other first, giving Dennis and Conrad a bit of time waiting on the bench not too far. Dennis once again slipped off the shoe just so he can look directly at his sock son with worry expression. <br />
<br />
Conrad noticed and asked &quot;Dennis, what wrong with you? Is your sock too tight for you or what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh no, sir, nothing at all!&quot; Dennis tried to denied but Conrad won&#39;t take it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t lie to me Dennis, I saw you keep looking at it over and over&quot; His boss frowned &quot;If it is too tight for you, that&#39;s perfect fine with me since mine is too loose&quot; He pointed at his own socks which Dennis just noticed here how loose it is &quot;I have an idea, why don&#39;t we swap our socks, just so we can play with no problem at all&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? Now? Sir... I don&#39;t think we need to...&quot; But Conrad looking directly at Dennis, even with no words out, Dennis already knew he can&#39;t refuse here, Conrad is his boss so if his boss already decided something, there&#39;s no place for him to change his mind... But one of the sock, the left sock, is his son... Right?<br />
<br />
Since Mr. Bouvier and his partner are still busy warming up and didn&#39;t pay attention at them at the moment, it wasn&#39;t anything hard or weird to let them swapped the socks between Dennis and Conrad. When Dennis finished pulling both of Conrad&#39;s socks on. it fit him perfectly well. Conrad just finished pulling on the right sock, the next one is the left one, that is Jeff, Dennis can&#39;t help but keep staring at his boss, it almost feel like a watching slow motion when Conrad pulling Jeff on, when Conrad finished, Dennis ended up saying &quot;I hope you&#39;re okay...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis was speaking to Jeff but Conrad mistook it for himself, he wiggled his toes a bit and say with smile &quot;Oh don&#39;t worry about it, your socks fit me just fine, a bit too very comfortable, to be fair&quot; He then slides his foot back into his tennis shoe, traps Jeff in there, just like he does to Jeff himself before.<br />
<br />
Jeff meanwhile. is screaming with no voice come out, he is confused with all that was happened today, first he turned into a sock for his dad, his dad wearing him on a tennis match, been like hours trapped in a dark sweaty tennis shoe and he have to absorbing all of the single drops of his dad sweat... And the same time, Jeff feels like his sport skills getting ripped away from him and with how much his dad has improved today, it cleared that his skills was sent to his dad somehow. Jeff wondering if he turned back to normal, will his skill return? But soon Jeff heard his dad&#39;s boss wanted to swap their socks, Now Jeff find himself on another man&#39;s feet, he&#39;s now covered Mr. Conrad feet. The feeling of Mr. Conrad wearing him on is bit different from when his dad was wearing him, Jeff is not too sure which one he like the most, to be fair, he can just answer that he like none of them...<br />
<br />
But when the tennis match started, the same feeling happened to Jeff again. His skills feel like it getting ripped away more and more as the game keeps went on. As for Conrad, as the game went on, he surprised that he himself suddenly getting better played just like Dennis. As for Dennis, even he is not wearing Jeff anymore but the skills he got still not going away. Even Dennis is still seem to be a bit distracted and looking at Conrad&#39;s shoe where Jeff is in there every times he got a chance. The game still went very easily for Dennis and Conrad. Soon, the game ended with the victory for Dennis and Conrad with no doubt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Playing with you two feel like playing with a young skillful lad you know?&quot; Mr. Bouvier laughed. He just lose the game but didn&#39;t seems to upset much &quot;We&#39;ll have a rematch sometime soon but I&#39;ll have to show my white flag today&quot; He shook hand with both Dennis and Conrad and then leave the club. <br />
<br />
Conrad slapped Dennis on the back happily &quot;Well done Dennis! You was getting better and I&#39;m getting better too, not sure why but we won so it&#39;s okay, right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m happy we won the game, sir...&quot; He said, still glaring down at Conrad&#39;s shoe a bit but Conrad didn&#39;t notice as he busy enjoying the moment of his victory so Dennis decided to start saying &quot;Sir, I think it&#39;s time to swap our socks back&quot;<br />
<br />
Conrad raised his eyebrows and then looking down at his shoes, looking up and say &quot;Oh! I almost forgot about that since your socks happened to fit with my feet just fine, haha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis was waiting for Conrad to remove his shoes and give his socks back to him but Conrad didn&#39;t do it. He seems to be thinking a bit and soon he say &quot;But why would we have to do that Dennis? Your socks fit my feet more than your and my socks fit your feet well, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis stammering &quot;B...But... S...Sir...! T...That sock...&quot; Dennis wanted to say one of the sock is his son but he knew how crazy he will sound if he say that so he can&#39;t think of anything to say more than that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Dennis! What&#39;s the point for keeping socks that don&#39;t even fit you!&quot; His boss said with a bit angry tone &quot;I&#39;ll keep this one, no question ask, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Dennis knew he can&#39;t win here so he just say &quot;I understand Mr. Conrad&quot;<br />
<br />
His boss back to his happy mood again &quot;See? Why bothering about unfit socks. Join me at the bar Dennis, I&#39;ll buy you a good drink as a prize for winning today&#39;s game&quot; <br />
<br />
Dennis still keeps his eyes on Conrad&#39;s shoe contained Jeff sock from time to time the whole time they was at the bar. When the night is near, Conrad driving away in his car as Dennis bidding him a goodbye, watching until Conrad&#39;s car disappeared from the sight, Dennis then entered his own car, his head running wild, thinking about Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did I just do, giving my boy away just like that... What should I do...&quot; He talked to himself &quot;Maybe I should just tell Mr. Conrad but will he believe me?&quot; Dennis keep thinking &quot;Maybe I should check that weird clothes catalog...? I have a feeling like I&#39;m the one who turned Jeff into a sock with that thing...&quot; Dennis keeps talking &quot;Think, Dennis, you can&#39;t just lost your boy like that...&quot;</p>
