<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max is home alone. His parents went out of town for the week as an anniversary trip but as soon as the virus broke out all planned we&#39;re grounded so his parents were stuck. Earlier in the day the nanny his parents had hired to watch him while they were gone had got a phone call from her fiance. He was asking her to come home. Something about wanting to spend time with her before it was to late. He wasn&#39;t quite sure why though. “Now Max,” she had said to him before she left. “I want you to lock the doors and windows while I’m gone. I’ll be back to get you in a day or two ok?”  there was something bad happening in the world and his nanny said she needed to check on her family. Whenever they talked about it on the news she had turned it off saying it wasn&#39;t appropriate for him. Max, now that he was home alone, decided he wanted to know exactly what was going on. He wandered downstairs to the living room and turned on the tv. The television was already on the news channel<br />
    &quot;Breaking news. The himbo virus is now spreading globally. nearly every city on the globe is experiencing the outbreak. The virus has also spread to animals. Anthropomorphic animal now walk the streets. Be extra wary of these himbos because if you so much as touch their…” but the newscaster but cut off by a loud bang behind the camera. The cameraman turned the camera around to see two naked men and a large horse like animal. The two men were extremely large. Nearly 6 feet tall. They were also extremely well endowed. There manhood reaching up to their chests. They we&#39;re on either side of the large horse thing. Rubbing it&#39;s member while it tilted it&#39;s head back and made a loud moaning noise. White liquid that max couldn&#39;t understand shot out. Covering the news crew and the news anchor. Screams could be heard as the camera panned over to two female castor&#39;s with huge cocks springing free of their tight dresses. Then back to the male newscaster and Max watched as his face pushed out turning into a horse head. Then max heard the camera man scream. The camera knocked over to face the camera man. He could see the male camra man turning into a horse, his ears pulling out of his head becoming long and thin, man with another horse man behind him. The cameraman was bent over with the horse’s hand hoof thing pushing him over. Then the screen cut to black.<br />
 Max was terrified by what he had just seen. He got up and started looking all the windows and doors. Then just in case he dragged the coffee table and multiple dining room chairs in front of the front door. And pushed the kitchen table in front of the back door. Then he closed all the blinds and turned off all the lights. He stared gathering up all the things in his room that made him feel better and made a small panic room in the basement. He sat there for a while reading books and talking to his imaginary friend. After about four hours he got curious. He wondered if the virus had spread to his town yet. He crept up the stairs and into is second floor bedroom. He pulled back the curtains a tiny bit and peaked out the window. <br />
The streets looked abandoned. Cars were parked in the middle of the street and forgotten. Scraps of clothes littered the pavement. White puddles of the stuff from the news were everywhere. Then he saw movement. A lady who he recognized as the mother of someone from school running down the road. She was being chased by a bull man and ram man. She tried to dart in between two house but was met with a black horse man. He knew exactly what was going to happen to her. The horse shot the white liquid on her while the other animal men cheered. Within seconds she had become a horse man as well. Her manhood now standing proud for all to see. He saw her start to turn towards his house. He ducked under the window and closed the blinds.<br />
 Breathing heavily he peeked back through the window and saw them walking away. Relieved he went downstairs to get a glass of water. He filled the glass up with tap water and took a sip. It tasted a little saltier than he remembers. He pays no mind an gulps down the rest of the cup before returning to his panic room. He sat down and picked his book back up and turned on the flashlight. <br />
As he was reading he started to feel strange. His body started to heat up. He was beginning to sweat. He didn&#39;t notice as his tiny member began to become erect. He felt it pressing against the book in his lap. Curious he picked up the book to investigate. He was shocked to see his penis tenting his pants. The more he looked at it the more he heated up. Soon the heat was unbearable. He took off all his clothes and laid down on the cold cement floor if the basement. Panting he felt his body smasm. It felt like he was growing taller. He felt a crunch and a crack as his spine and legs great longer. The pain was unbearable. Pushing himself up onto his elbows he looked over his body. His once 4 foot 8 body had grown significantly. He was now almost 6 feet tall. A wave of hear suddenly washed over him. His face pushed out and looked more horselike. He reached up and felt his face. He looked down and his still tiny member. An intense wave of something he couldn&#39;t describe washed over him. He fell back on to his back thrusting his hips into the air. His penis gained several inches of length. Going from two to about 8. He looked down at it. He wondered why this was happening to him he. Hadn&#39;t even come in Contact with a himbo let alone the white liquid. Then something clicked in his mind. Semen. That&#39;s what the white liquid was called. Suddenly another wave of heat. Witch he now knew to be lust rolled over him his member was now growing thicker and longer. Constantly adding more inches to his proud erection. He felt his legs start to become digirad like a horse&#39;s legs. His feet hardened and turned into hooves. Dappled grey fur sprang up all over his body making his skin itch. His hands turned hoof like although still being functional as hands. To his horror, he start to like it. He reached down and touched his cock. It twitched as he did so. Suddenly the urge to rub it like he had seen on TV overcame him. He took his penis in his hands and began to rub up and down. Doing this felt so good. He could feel the final changes happening to him as he masturbated. A tail pushed from his backside, his cock reached a massive 2 ½ feet long, and his mind changed. He wanted to infect others as well. He wanted them to know how good it felt being like him. Then in he let out a moan of pure ecstasy as he came, shooting semen all over his panic room. He wanted and watched as his long cock retracted into his sheath. He got to his feet now being a whopping 8 feet tall he admired himself. Then he walked up the stairs, removed the block from the door, and went out to bring people to his side.</p>
