<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The signing had proceeded smoothly. The absence of Jordan due to “She’s feeling quite ill” was readily accepted. Sam felt some misgivings after checking the added clauses. The contract  stipulated that ‘Sam Colson’ would need to return to this very office within one months&#39; time to oversee the roll-out of the software. That in itself was not a problem, Sam regularly visited sites to implement rollouts. The problem was that this company expected &#39;Sam Colson&#39; to be the blonde woman she currently was. By signing Sam was committing to returning here as a woman. That wasn&#39;t all though. There was provision for two further site visits ‘by ‘Sam Colson’ in the next 2 year’s if they were deemed necessary. So there was potentially 3 more occasions when Sam would be in skirts. She hoped the bonus was worth it and signed.<br />
<br />
Next thing Sam knew, she was alone in the room with Angus. That made her nervous as she was almost certain that Angus had felt her up earlier. He had been subtle about it (unlike his father the previous night) and Sam had to admit Angus&#39;s back massage had indeed stopped her coughing, but Sam wasn&#39;t sure her bum needed to be squeezed as part of that massage. What worried Sam the most though, was that her body actually liked the contact. She could feel her nipples harden, even now, just thinking about it,<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s done. I had better head back to the hotel and see how Jordan is going&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you go we need to discuss the followup. When can you be back to implement the rollout?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll co-ordinate with Alistair. He needs to get back to me with a complete list of computers that need the software. I&#39;ll also have to modify our standard packet as the contract stipulated. Hopefully all that groundwork can be completed in the next couple of weeks&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you would be back here in a fortnight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm. Probably not. In two weeks I will be able to send out links so that someone here, probably Alistair can upload the modified software to all your computers. I imagine that might take close to a week&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you can still be back here by the end of the month?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... Probably. I would need to check my diary&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well please do so. We need to know the day of implintation&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam hurriedly checked her phone. &quot;I could do the 28th and 29th of the month. That&#39;s a Thursday and Friday. I&#39;ll need one day to conduct a training course and the next day to sort out the inevitable glitches&quot;<br />
<br />
Angus was consulting his own phone. &quot;That works for me. I have nothing on that I couldn&#39;t rearrange&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Let&#39;s settle on those dates&quot; Sam wasn&#39;t worried about the rollout itself, she had done many such rollouts, although this would be one of the bigger ones she had been involved in. What concerned her more was that she would be doing this as a female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done! Now how about a bit of a celebration. What time is your flight?&quot;<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s a 1.35 flight&quot;<br />
<br />
“Do you have your luggage with you?”<br />
<br />
“No. Jordan is going to get her luggage and my own to the airport. I’ll meet her there”<br />
<br />
“In that case we have time enough then for a quick lunch. There is a lovely little restaurant two doors down. I’ve already made a tentative booking”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?  We are supposed to check in 45 minutes before departure. That doesn’t give us long”<br />
<br />
“Get Jordan to collect your boarding pass and check the bags in. I’ll arrange the driver to get you there by 1 pm.”<br />
<br />
Sam supposed she needed to get lunch somewhere. “I guess so in that case”<br />
<br />
The restaurant was indeed quite nice. French themed, it was on the ground floor of another skyscraper. It was only when they were seated at a table for two that Sam realised no one else was coming. When they were seated, Sam found out that Angus had rung ahead and ordered meals already. The waiter assured her that they would be arriving within 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Angus ordered champagne to go with the very fancy toasted sandwiches that came with some unpronounceable name. Sam wasn’t driving and work was finished for the day so she decided there was no reason not to indulge. She accepted the glass. It was very nice.<br />
<br />
They initially made small talk about the weather, then Angus talked about his basketball team. When the meal came out Angus bought the subject back to the rollout “So you would arrive on the 27th. That’s a Wednesday, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“I haven’t checked what flights are available. I might be able to catch an early flight on the the Thursday” Sam most likely would fly in on the Wednesday night but didn&#39;t want to commit to that.<br />
<br />
“I’ll rearrange my own schedule to make sure I’m around. Could I perhaps arrange some entertainment for you on the Thursday night?”<br />
<br />
Sam didn’t know where this was going. Often when overnight with clients she would socialise with them at a local bar. “I guess so. I know no-one else in this town”<br />
<br />
“Great I’ll arrange something”<br />
<br />
Angus also spoke about Jordan’s illness. “I was speaking to Cheryl we both thought Jordan had headed home early just to avoid father’s leching. We didn’t think she was actually sick. I hope it’s nothing serious”<br />
<br />
“She wasn’t feeling herself” that was the truth “She thought it best to have a quite morning” <br />
<br />
Sam ate her meal, being very careful not to spill anything on the silky white shirt she was wearing. Looking down she realised the lace of her bra showed through the material. The waiter had taken her jacket when they had entered.<br />
<br />
“So could I ask more about your family? All I know is that you are originally from the Kentucky and played basketball. Do you have any siblings?”<br />
<br />
The mention of Kentucky made Sam’s thoughts turn to Jordan. Jordan was from Kentucky. She must have told Angus this last night. Jordan was also currently her twin. Without thinking through the consequences, she replied “I have a twin sister”<br />
<br />
“A twin? Oh! Are you identical?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. We are very hard to tell apart” Sam only now realised she was digging herself a hole.<br />
<br />
“What’s her name?”<br />
<br />
Sam had to think up a name quickly “Emma”<br />
<br />
“Wow! It’s hard to imagine two women as gorgeous as you are. Have you ever done that twin thing where you pretend to be each other?”<br />
<br />
Sam knew she needed to shut this conversation down now, before the lies got out of control. She had finished her meal “I really should get going soon. How long does it take to get to the airport?”<br />
<br />
Angus glanced at his watch. “We still have 10 minutes. It’s a half hour drive even in the busiest traffic. 20 minutes normally”<br />
<br />
“Umm. I need to visit the bathroom. Will you excuse me?”<br />
<br />
Embarrassingly Angus stood up and helped her out of her chair. Sam felt herself blushing. She didn’t like to lie, so she didn’t want to face any more personal questions. She made her way to the rest room aware of how her bum wiggled in the pencil skirt and heels she was wearing. She had no doubt that Angus was watching.<br />
<br />
Sam stayed in the rest room as long as she could without appearing to be ill. She did urinate and checked her panties for any sign of blood. They were clean. When she came out she found Angus had paid the bill and was near the door talking to the company driver, whose name was Billy. She accepted her jacket from the waiter and made her way over. <br />
<br />
Angus spoke “Evidently the traffic is rather busy today, so Billy recommends you leave now”<br />
<br />
“Well thank you for the lunch” Sam put on her jacket and moved to the door.<br />
<br />
Sam felt her hand being grasped. It was Angus “It’s my pleasure. I’ll look forward to seeing you next time. I believe the state opera are putting on a performance that night. We could have dinner and see the show. Bring something appropriate to wear” The man then raised Sam’s hand to his mouth and gave it a kiss. In the manner of the old knights. <br />
<br />
Sam found himself blushing once more. She hurried to the company car which was parked out the front. Billy opened the rear door of the car and Sam hurriedly got in. She had expected the entertainment Angus had mentioned earlier to be drinks and a meal at a bar. Dinner and a night at the opera, sounded more like a date.</p>
