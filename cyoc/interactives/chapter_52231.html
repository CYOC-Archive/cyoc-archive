<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark got into the shower.  He'd waited a few minutes, letting the water get nice and warm, the way he liked it.  Cassie had acted strangely at dinner, basically ignoring him.  He'd always liked his sister, and he'd thought she cared for him as well.  He sighed.  Maybe it was inevitable.  She was so damned smart, normal people probably seemed like morons to her.<br />
<br />
He'd always thought he was fairly smart, but nowhere close to her.  What a drag.  His thoughts were interrupted by a wrenching sensation in his gut.  He puked up his dinner, doubling over in pain.  The only sound he could muster was a gasp.<br />
<br />
His flesh and bones seemed to warp, and there was a painful contraction in his groin, even as his chest began to burn.  Sharp pinpricks of pain could be felt all over his body as he fell to the floor of the tub...<br />
<br />
-Time Passes-<br />
<br />
Cool water falling on Mark's body caused him to come to.  Groggily, he reached for the faucet, turning off the flow.  His body felt sore as hell, and he barely managed to crawl out of the tub.  Reaching up to the sink, he managed to pull himself to his feet.<br />
<br />
His balance felt all off, and his legs were wobbly.  &quot;Ugh, must have been something I ate.&quot;<br />
<br />
The instant he said it, he froze.  His voice!  It was higher pitched and softer, almost like a girl's voice!  He reached out for the mirror, wiping away the condensation, and was shocked at what he saw.<br />
<br />
A girl!  A rather pretty girl, actually, with shoulder-length brown hair.  She kind of resembled him, but she looked more like his mother than, well, himself!  She was shorter than he was (had been?), and though small, two perfect breasts were visible.<br />
<br />
He touched one experimentally, and nearly recoiled in shock.  The skin was more sensitive than he'd anticipated!  Slowly, he touched it again.  This wasn't his first time touching a girl's body, but this...!<br />
<br />
He was a girl.  Reaching down between his legs, all he found was a small mound of hair and a slit where his penis and scrotum had once been.  Just touching the area sent a bolt of pleasant sensation up his spine and into his brain.  He felt faint.<br />
<br />
Carefully he made his way to the toilet seat and sat down.  This wasn't a dream.  It was very weird, but it was very real as well.  What would his family think?<br />
<br />
What would his girlfriend, Erika, think?!<br />
<br />
He didn't know what to do, but it occured to him there was one person who might.  Drying off his body (and trying to ignore how good touching his body felt!), he slipped on his bathrobe, which now hung loosely on him.  Previously, he'd been about 5' 11&quot;, now, he guessed himself to be closer to his Mother's 5' 4&quot;.  &quot;Fuck, I could wear Mom's clothes!&quot;<br />
<br />
He shuddered at the thought of wearing girl's clothes, and made his way to his sister's room.  He shook her arm gently.  &quot;Cassie?&quot;<br />
<br />
His sister yawned cutely.  She was flawlessly beautiful, to the point that he sometimes wondered if she was real.  He was sure Cassie hadn't always been quite this pretty, but he couldn't put his finger on when things had changed; it felt like it had snuck up on him overnight!<br />
<br />
(Which, in a way, it had...)<br />
<br />
&quot;...ugh, Mark, what do you want?&quot;  Cassie had a way of talking before her brain was fully awake.  It was one of her endearing traits, really.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Cass, something totally weird is happening, you have to help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
His sister's deep blue eyes shot open, and she looked at him in surprise.  &quot;Who...no, wait...Mark?  You're a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...so it seems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie frowned, and for a moment, she'd looked...guilty?  No, it was impossible, genius or no, you can't turn a guy into a girl in minutes!<br />
<br />
She sat up and turned on her bedside light.  &quot;Wow, you're pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark groaned.  &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassie giggled and said something...it sounded like &quot;I wish...&quot;<br />
<br />
Things turned black.<br />
<br />
-Time Passes-<br />
<br />
I woke up in my bed.  I'd had a really odd dream, something about changing into something weird.  For some reason, I was pretty horny too, embarrasingly so.  I wished Erika was here, but...<br />
<br />
Marcy sighed.  So far, the only person she'd told about her relationship with Erika was her little sister.  She wasn't sure how her mother would take the news.  Which meant she couldn't exactly call her girlfriend over right now, no matter how...satisfying it would be.<br />
<br />
Other girls might resort to touching themselves, or using a vibrator, but Marcy had never been comfortable about such things.  It felt too impersonal and weird somehow.  So she bit her tongue and tried to think about things that wouldn't turn her on.<br />
<br />
Looking around her room didn't help; Marcy had always been a tomboy, and her room looked more like a boy's room.  Complete with pictures of pretty girls.  Oh sure, granted, they were anime girls, which is probably why her mother hadn't quite clued in on the truth...but Marcy found them attractive all the same.<br />
<br />
Getting out of bed, Marcy dropped to the floor and did twenty push-ups, then reached for her free weights.  They seemed heavier to her for some reason, but she pushed herself anyways.  A lot of girls are averse to working out, but not Marcy.<br />
<br />
At seventeen, she was only 5' 3&quot; and unlikely to get any taller.  So to make up for her small size, she'd started working out years ago.  It gave her a lean, almost sleek look, as well as compact, wiry muscles.  She blushed a little.  Sure, maybe her breasts were on the small side, but she knew Erika liked her muscles just fine.<br />
<br />
Glancing in the mirror, she was glad that, even if she wasn't quite as smart as her little sister, she enjoyed much of the same genetics; quite simply, she was a real looker.<br />
<br />
Granted, she'd probably look better if she styled her hair and worked out less, or even wore clothing that flattered her body, but in her mind, she was attractive enough without being a girly girl.<br />
<br />
Hell, she even wore boxers, finding them a lot more comfortable than panties.  The only time she wore girl's underwear was when she had to wear a tampon.  She shuddered just thinking about it.  &quot;Sometimes, I wish I was a boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed.  Not like wishing for something would make it so.  After applying some deoderant, she got dreassed, jeans, tee-shirt, and a hoodie, along with sneakers.  Her mother agonized that she dressed so much like a guy, but at least Cassie never judged her.<br />
<br />
Her hair was mussed as usual, but eh, she had the hoodie for that.  She made her way to the breakfast table, finding Cassie and Mom already there.  Mom looked...really damn good this morning.  Marcy couldn't put her finger on it.  I mean, naturally, she looked as attractive as her daughters, but...she seemed somehow younger and sexier.<br />
<br />
Realizing that she was effectively checking out her own mother, Cassie concentrated on her breakfast.  She hated how her hormones had a mind of their own, because once again she was feeling very aroused.<br />
<br />
As a result, she failed to notice the smile on her sister's face, as if she was enjoying a very private joke...</p>
