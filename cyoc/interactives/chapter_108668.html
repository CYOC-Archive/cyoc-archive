<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zach kept talking while he was walking alongside Mark. He was telling him about all the boys that he had met in the last two years, how some of them has accepted their fates and some other become crazy and tried to escape.<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know if they were able to flee or the Caretakers got them.&quot; Zach said. &quot;I had a friend called Ray who was in Animal. He had gotten monkey&#39;s features like high jumping and climbing so fast, he even had a monkey tail! He thought that he could escape with his new abilities and one night he jumped to a vent and ran. I never saw him again.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you think they capture him?&quot; Mark asked him.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Zach said. &quot;But, since then, the vents have extra reinforcement. His actions weren&#39;t ignored, so I assume they chase him.&quot;<br />
&quot;Chase him...&quot; Mark repeated. &quot;What would happen if they capture him?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot; Zach said. &quot;They could do almost anything, taking off his food supply, torture him or... something worse.&quot;<br />
&quot;Worse?&quot; Mark said a little scared.<br />
&quot;They can send him to the restricted zone...&quot; Zach said.<br />
&quot;The restricted zone?&quot; Mark said. &quot;What happens there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nobody knows.&quot; Zach said. &quot;But we have theories. Some people guess that place is reserved for the most painful experiments, something that could destroy your humanity. There is a theory about mutations, so high doses of your regular testings that they turned you into a monster. I am in the group who thinks they mix the experiments from different zones, like Mind and Cyborg or Fertility and Gender. I think it&#39;s the less horrible theory.&quot;<br />
Mark didn&#39;t say anything, he just thought that Zach could be right. It sounds the less awful punishment if he could choose one. He wished that none of his Friends had tried to escape until he find them. That could mean that he won&#39;t be able to see them again.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve arrived sir, the restroom.&quot; Zach said with a smile while he made a little bow. His tail-like pipe was between his legs.<br />
&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; Mark replied while he was grinning. He thought that Zach was a good friend after all.<br />
Zach opened the door and waited until Mark entered. He saw the place and got surprised of how it was.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s bigger than I thought&quot; Mark told to Zach.<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re many boys here and all of them need to go to bathroom.&quot; Zach said. &quot;There are three areas, the sinks are on the left, the toilets and urinals on the right and the showers on the center.&quot;<br />
&quot;The center?&quot; Mark replied. &quot;But there&#39;s nothing in the center!&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course there is. Look up.&quot; Zach told him and he pointed to the ceiling. Mark saw a file of shower heads hanging there and covering almost all the central area. &quot;They are automatic. You just need to stay down them and the water will begin to fall.&quot;<br />
&quot;But there are no walls behind them.&quot; Mark pointed out. &quot;Everybody could see you when you&#39;re showering!&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, but at least we&#39;re all boys.&quot; Zach told him. &quot;There&#39;s nothing that you hadn&#39;t seen before on yourself.&quot; Mark&#39;s cheeks turned a little red. &quot;Also, that&#39;s a good way to look how other guys change from their testings without look like a stalker. Some boys are too shy to talk about themselves but, hey, they also need to shower.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;ll be watching me while I was showering?&quot; Mark questioned him.<br />
&quot;Not just me, but almost everybody.&quot; Zach said. &quot;We are boys after all! Curiosity is normal between us.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mmm...&quot; Mark wasn&#39;t sure to like to shower with Zach around. &quot;And do you have a place for shaving?&quot;<br />
&quot;Shaving?&quot; Zach said. &quot;I don&#39;t know. No one has needed to shave before. Do you shave?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, but I had grown a beard before I arrived here.&quot; Mark replied. &quot;If it grows back I will need a way to shave it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that.&quot; Zach told him. &quot;That beard was temporary. Some boys got them with their first testings but it won&#39;t come back after shaving. Look at your face! It&#39;s as smooth as a baby&#39;s butt! Hahaha!&quot;<br />
Almost inmediately, Mark ran to a mirror and touched his face while he watch himself. He realize that Zach was right. There was no sign of a beard on his face, no spots nor shades. Just a regular boy&#39;s face.<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that possible?&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;I think that&#39;s due that they need perfect boys for their testings. Like a blank canvas to watch from the beginning. You won&#39;t see any sign of male developement aside from the ones on the testings.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, we&#39;re like eternal kids.&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t say it like that but, yeah, I haven&#39;t seen any of us growing or getting older.&quot; Zach said.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re like the lost boys in Peter Pan.&quot; Mark said.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s oddly accurate.&quot; Zach said. &quot;But I&#39;m happy like that and a lot of other boys too. Think about that, we don&#39;t have grown ups worries or duties. We have food, a bed and even friends! Will you waste that for some hair on your face?&quot;<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s no the point of growing.&quot; Mark replied. &quot;We&#39;re taken apart from society, the real world!&quot;<br />
&quot;And what has the real world done for you?!&quot; Zach yelled, he showed some fury on his words as he had remembered something terrible. He stopped and apologized to Mark. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t want to yell at you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, buddy. I didn&#39;t realize how meaningful is this for you... I&#39;m sorry too-&quot; Mark stopped talking as he heard a weird sound. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; The noise repeated, it was like something hitting a metal plate.<br />
&quot;It came from that cabin.&quot; Zach said as he approaches to the sound&#39;s origin. &quot;I will count to three and then we both tackle wathever is there, ok?&quot; Mark nodded. &quot;One... two... and... Three!!&quot;<br />
Zach opened the door and both boys jumped in with funny warrior&#39;s poses that they saw from tv as they shout. They expected to see a monster or something like that. Instead, they found a blond boy screaming scared of the boys that suddenly invaded his privacy. Apparently he was pissing because when he turned to see them his dick pointed to them and dipped their faces. Zach and Mark fell to the floor as the other boy fell to the toilet, still pissing on the floor.</p>
