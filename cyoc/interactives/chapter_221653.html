<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Matt scrolled through the endless list, his eyes darted across each suggestion. He encountered numerous transformations, from the erotic to the mundane, the bizarre to the downright impossible. There were options for changing to animals, even anthropomorphic figures straight out of fantasy. Other options offered to turn him into living artwork, or even pieces of furniture. Each more beguiling yet ultimately terrifying than the last.<br />
<br />
His attention, however, landed on a rather unconventional transformation that he’d never seen discussed in the online communities. It was labeled &quot;Cyber-Mouse Biker&quot;.<br />
<br />
Without much thought for the consequences, driven by adrenaline mixed with a sense of liberation he&#39;d only dreamt of so far, he stripped himself bare and activated the transformation. A sense of erotic anticipation washed through him, causing his member to stand at attention. <br />
<br />
As soon as he pressed the button, a cold blue glow emitted from the Chronivac that quickly enveloped him. The transformation started. His skin prickled with a strange tickle-turned-sensation as it changed to a powdery black hue around his waist, while a layer of bright grey fur began to sprout all over the rest of his body. <br />
<br />
Simultaneously, Matt felt his face warp unsettlingly yet thrillingly as his nose pad thickened, forming a rodent-like muzzle. His ears too transformed into large round shapes akin to a mouse&#39;s, causing his face to resemble an anthropomorphic rodent.  <br />
<br />
Just as he got accustomed to the new changes in his face, he felt his feet begin to harden, taking on the structure of sturdy leather boots with embedded soles. His calves and thighs morphed to mimic the texture of leather biker pants, detailed with knee protectors. His lower body was complete when he felt a belt cinching in just above where his penis was and a smooth bulge appeared in place of it.<br />
<br />
Feeling more muscular than ever, he noticed his chest was also covered in the same gray fur as the rest of his body. Suddenly, he felt an intense sensation in his right arm. As he looked down, flesh and fur turned into hard metal before his very eyes, forming mechanical joints at the shoulder, elbow, wrists, and fingers. Band of metal even took form in a vent on his upper arm, while screws solidified its mechanical look. A sleek display appeared on the back of his hand, reiterating its cybernetic transformation.<br />
<br />
Curiosity piqued, Matt&#39;s hand instinctively moved downward, fingers threading through the soft grey fur where they encountered the smooth bulge where his penis once resided. A thrill, halfway between curiosity and arousal, shot through him at the contact. The sensation was strangely pleasing, even inducing a gentle waves of pleasure through his altered body.<br />
<br />
Next, his attention turned to his right arm, the mechanical appendage that looked so out of place amidst the furry undergrowth. It was weighty and solid - a strength he’d never possessed before, yet it moved with a finesse he’d never dreamt of. The small display nestled at the back of his hand caught the light. It was a touch screen, integrated into his new skin seamlessly. Tentatively, he touched his fingers against it, and it instantly illuminated, presenting him with a menu.<br />
<br />
Inside that menu were options he couldn&#39;t even fathom in his wildest dreams. He could change the concentration of his breath&#39;s scent, alter the shade of his fur, choose between dozens of different eye shades. One option, however, invigorated a primal fear within him. Within his newfound morass of possibilities, he found an option to change his size.<br />
<br />
A shiver of anticipation coursed through his body. Summoning all the courage he had, he selected the mouse-sized option. Within seconds, an entirely new sensation consumed him. The world around him started becoming bigger, his once-familiar surroundings transforming into a veritable jungle of gargantuan objects. Outstretching his newly granted muscular legs, he sprinted towards the shadows, dwarfish in comparison to the monolithic world around him. <br />
<br />
With his heart fluttering in his miniature chest, Matt tentatively selected the &quot;helmet&quot; option from the display on his mechanical arm. The action was so foreign, yet now so natural, that his very soul seemed to shudder at the bizarre novelty of it all. <br />
<br />
The moment his fingers grazed the screen to confirm his selection, he felt a soft tug at the base of his large round ears. In response, almost instinctively, his new, mechanical right hand rose to feel the top of his head. What he felt caused him sheer awe. <br />
<br />
The sensation was both exhilarating and strange - unlike anything he had experienced before. Beneath the cool touch of his metallic fingers, he could feel parts of a helmet begin to take shape. It was like watching a 3D printer in action, except this was happening right from his head, shaping around his mouse-like features - the sturdy rodent muzzle, the protruding ears, and the furry contours of his skull. <br />
<br />
The helmet formed, swift yet seamlessly, becoming a part of him as much as the grey fur that now covered his body. He moved his metal fingers over the exterior of the helmet, feeling the sleek texture, the perfect contours, the comfortable fit. It was designed not only for safety but also for style. Every inch of it seemed to scream a wild, rebellious streak, a characteristic as new to him as his mechanized limb and furry form. <br />
<br />
The helmet was undeniably made for him - designed to protect his newfound, rodent form. It had a sheen of quality, evidencing its durability. It fitted over the back of his skull, not too tight and not too loose, curving over his ears without causing discomfort. The visor was tinted a translucent black, far too wide for any human, but perfect for his rodent eyes, protecting them whilst giving him nearly unimpeded peripheral vision. <br />
<br />
Displaying the audacious audacity of his newfound Chronivac power, Matt didn&#39;t hesitate to select the next option labeled &quot;Cycletaur.&quot; As soon as he tapped the screen, a fresh round of alterations washed over his lower body.<br />
<br />
His being stirred with an unprecedented sensation as his lower body began to swell and stretch grotesquely into a large amorphous blob, expanding forwards and backwards. It was a sight both gruesome and strangely exhilarating. Bit by bit, the blob-like lower part started taking a distinctly mechanical shape. Wheels surfaced from either end, pressing down onto the ground, hoisting up the central mass. <br />
<br />
In the middle portion of the blob, where his waistband used to rest, he observed both familiar and foreign elements. His belt and the strip of his leather pants melded flawlessly with the swathes of sleek, black leather that took the form of a saddle.<br />
<br />
Gradually, the front end of the bulbous shape fashioned itself into a sleek cockpit, replete with a symmetric array of machinery - fuel meters, speedometers, and other essential instruments. Handlebars sprouted just under his rodent chest, with controls on either side. Auxiliary and high-beam lights formed on the front of the motorcycle.<br />
<br />
Behind him, the posterior end of his transformed body mellowed down into the tail end of the motorcycle, complete with saddlebags. His heart pounded in his chest as he saw his new form. His mechanical touch-screen arm lost its screen. Instead, he could access the transformation options through the computerized panel on his handlebars.<br />
<br />
In one swift move, Matt had blended the form of a submissive rodent and a strong touring motorcycle to become a Cycletaur. Overwhelmed by excitement and adrenaline, Matt revved the engines embedded within himself. The vibrations echoed through his metal lower body, the sensation arousing him strangely.<br />
<br />
His motorcycle tires spun in place momentarily before propelling him forward. Mouse-sized as he was, his room felt enormous, like a fertile playground. He maneuvered expertly between looming furniture, experiencing the surge of liberation unlike anything he&#39;d tasted before. The roar of his engine was drowned by the pounding of his heart in his ears – he was finally living the transformation fantasy he’d only ever dared to dream.</p>
