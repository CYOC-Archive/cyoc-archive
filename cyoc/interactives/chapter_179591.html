<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What you say there,&quot; asked Gwen, overhearing a friend commenting, as rumored about a female donkey said to near having the ability to speak words; at the least understandable words that made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is bunk, no donkey is able to speak intelligible words; where did you hear this from, who told you such a tale?&quot; Gwen acting as overly flustered, almost slipped with giving the name of the person and friend she had transformed to being a jennet Donkey.<br />
<br />
Darla stood her ground, she facing Gwen, did reach her right arm with the index finger pointing at Gwen as she said, &quot;You should know the donkey, she was your friend, as one Ass knows another if just by their smell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen felt insulted but also shamed, as Darla and a few close friends knew what Gwen learned how to do, and did to a few friends and foes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what do you think I am,&quot; Gwen foolishly said, as dared for Darla to spill the beans, informing all of what Gwen could cause to happen to people, when wishing to humiliate them or deem them to disappear.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are a witch, and worse than an evil person, as hold to no rules or morals,&quot; Darla boldly said, as Gwen began to back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that Gwen is a witch,&quot; asked Melinda?<br />
<br />
I know because of what Gwen did to Robert, when I was dating him. My parents were away for a weekend and I asked bobby to be near me and keep me company by day and night. Gwen asked bobby to go with her on a date and he said he was going to visit me for a whole weekend romp. He said that Gwen became angry and she said to him as not to fuck me after midnight or his cock would become stuck, as unable to thrust or have him pull free.<br />
<br />
Bobby ignored what Gwen said, but told me about her glaring eyes, she staring at him as if cursing him.<br />
<br />
We ignored what Gwen said and after my special made diner I cooked for him, we retired to my bedroom and got cozy. We had our fun fling, but Bobby abruptly stopped his thrusting when we heard the grandfather clock in the downstairs foyer chime the witching hour of midnight. What Gwen caused came from her being the offspring of her parents transformed while visiting Pleasure Island. Her dad and mom became as donkeys, the mated and Gwen was their prodigy. <br />
<br />
A prodigy is a different person gifted with abnormal abilities, some graduating to being magical, like a witch!<br />
<br />
Poor Bobby, as at midnight when he was sweating as thrusting he and I felt his penis begin to grow. It grew bigger of such girth it was the size of a ten ounce Canadian size pop can, but grew longer, gaining a sheath and texture equal to a mature male donkey.<br />
<br />
We laid there stuck, being together, his donkey cock buried deep inside me, as we climaxed, thrilled by orgasm after gut wrench orgasms, that continued until that Sunday morning; during which dear Bobby became an anthro-donkey. Naturally he felt humiliated, and when we parted, the massive wealth of his spent semen inside me gushed out like Niagara Falls.<br />
<br />
Bobby knelt over me, his penis extended almost two feet in length, as was he then furry from head to his hind hoofs. He grew a donkey tail, and his nose merged with his mouth to form a donkey muzzle. He had donkey tall ears, and his eye became round like those of a donkey.<br />
<br />
He felt terrible, quite humiliated, but I liked him better for being a stud!<br />
<br />
Bobby mated with me that entire Sunday and as luck would come to those in need of luck, my dad phoned and informed me that he and mom decided to stay the full week at the lakeside resort. Bobby offered me his best donkey toothed grin and our sexual frolicking continued for more days, until on the following Friday night at midnight, my bobby became as all a male donkey, body, mind, and desires.<br />
<br />
Gwen mocked me the next Monday morning, she called and offered info where there was a farm looking for breeding stud donkeys.<br />
<br />
Dear Bobby went to reside there, he being a donkey, and likely permanently a working stud.<br />
<br />
My bet is that Gwen spellbound of cursed  Jocelyn, and she is the talking donkey in the rumors I heard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, who do you think I am, a witch or sorcerous, get real, and as for Bobby, he moved to upper Michigan, found work there that he with his limited brainpower can handle,&quot; Gwen chided as if she knew more than did Darla.<br />
<br />
The rumored news suggested to Gwen her spellbinding done to Jocelyn was fading in power. As what Darla knew about Gwen&#39;s past was almost the full truth; something she felt humiliated to tell anyone about her own experiences of being a jennet foal and transitioning to being a human after she attained the age of five years as a donkey.<br />
<br />
Gwen went to seek a place to sit and contemplate her next move. She knew from her family experience what happened with her mom and dad, they honeymooned on the weird magical island, and drank donkey beer, as became firstly anthro-donkeys, and had a baby. <br />
<br />
Grumbling, Gwen muttered the well remembered tale of how she was foaled by her half-donkey mother. Gwen began her life being more a donkey than she was a human, and during her formative five years she grew to be as almost complete a human person, if but retaining her donkey genitalia. As she matured to being a teenager, Gwen gained exceptional intelligence and a higher level of reasoning ability. She learned through self fantasy and practice to disguise herself, taking back her jennet foal embodiment for short durations, lest she might breed, become impregnated and need remain a jennet mother for two years. <br />
<br />
According to what her mother told, Gwen and others like her, because they are born on Pleasure Island, owned the power to transform others to being as donkeys. She being one of the rare group known as &quot;Children of the Island&quot;, can and did transform any random person they might meet and feel deserved living their life being a donkey. <br />
<br />
To date, Gwen typically degraded boys she dated and for her reasons felt they were wimps or nerd, deserved transforming, would through aging regain their intelligence and learn to talk while still being a donkey. Jocelyn was by human age a early teenager, but due to her transforming and becoming a jennet donkey she had aged, as matured to equal a 39 years old person; and when she transitioned back to being a person, would retain her being middle-aged and experienced in love.<br />
<br />
Concerns of what Darla knew from when Gwen spellbound Bobby, as Gwen had managed his transfer to the Mackinaw Draft horse stud farm, where Bobby began his endeavors of breeding sire for creating of strong mules. Gwen smiled when she thought of how he likely cried during his first night away from home and those who could show him love and not brute lust. She smirked at the thought to spellbind Darla, creating from her sexy body a sleek as sassy jennet donkey, and manager her transfer to go work beside her horny lover Bobby the Jack?<br />
<br />
Anything remained as possible, and before she rose to walk from where she sat thinking and scheming, suddenly there was Kyle Rooste, the younger brother to Kevin, a high school athlete. Kyle was keen on Gwen and often tried to tweak her nipples or pinch her butt, but she was in no mood for his teen style play.</p>
