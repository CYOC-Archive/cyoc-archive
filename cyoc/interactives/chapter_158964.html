<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drale is right. You&#39;ve seen both sides now, the good and the bad. You&#39;re ready to make your decision, well, almost ready. There&#39;s one more thing you want to confirm. Without saying another word, you leave. The knights seeing you off, the men wishing you the best for whatever you decide. It genuinely hurts leaving them, you want to stay, to have some more fun with Marn and the other men as you wait for the new mission. But you need to do this, it&#39;s the only thing left on your mind.<br />
<br />
Putting on your gear as you leave the barracks, you turn down the road and head towards the castle. The guards giving you a swift nod as they let you pass, your path opened as you enter the regal building. The gates slowly opening to reveal the elegant interior, statues of armour adorning the walls as a red carpet leads towards the central throne room. This is it.<br />
<br />
A gorilla and a fox stand guard at the throne room. The two men staring at you as you approach, the gorilla speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;General Nate, I am happy to see you. Do you have business with the king?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look to the door, speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I wish to see Riefclaw. Is he free at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two guards share a glance, the fox heading into the room for a moment as you and the gorilla wait. The fox returning a minute later, his claw pushing the door open as the gorilla understands the order. The two opening the throne room for you as Riefclaw is in full view. Stepping forward, the carpet continues. Leading up a short set of stairs and ending at a golden throne. The lion sitting, completely in the nude as he speaks to a very familiar wolf. A bulky form, firm yet fat, Jargus. The wolf lapping at the kings dick as the two briefly speak, Riefclaw&#39;s hand reaching the back of Jargus&#39;s head as he spots you. The lion holding the wolf still, forcing his entire feline member inside the mans throat as he looks to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, it is good to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Usually you&#39;d feel awkward around this situation. The idea of a man having his mouth stuffed with dick being a real conversation killer, yet it feels right at home for you. You&#39;ve definitely adjusted to this city, Jargus barely being noticeable as you awkwardly bow before Riefclaw. The lion briefly laughing as he gestures for you to stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;King Riefclaw… I wish to talk, if that&#39;s alright. You seemed rather busy with Jargus though-&quot;<br />
<br />
Riefclaw begins to thrust, the king cutting you off with a grunt as his hand loosens. Jargus holding onto the kings back as he remains firm.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is fine Nate, we were just having a little talk about the future. For now you can ignore this man, he is simply showing me his gratitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
You decide to not push the point further. The two men clearly enjoying themselves, so nothing needing to be pressed. Instead, you present your other questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, then my king may I ask you something? I wish... I wish to know when your rule will end. Do you want the world to be full of beasts? Do you want a few kingdoms? Do you want every willing and unwilling man converted into your subject? I greatly appreciate the freedom you have given me, and I think I have made my decision. I just want to hear this all from your own mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riefclaw seems amused, his eyes closing for a moment as the thrusting stops. Jargus drinking his fill, before moving off the kings dick. The wolf standing, his back presented to Riefclaw as his armour begins to fall to the floor. Before long the man is naked, the king pushing him forward as he lands on all fours. The lion mounting the wolf, dick lined up to his ass as he relaxes on Jargus&#39;s back. Short and swift thrusts made into his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;What we have here is paradise Nate. There is no war between us, no uprisings. Problems that emerge are swiftly solved, the men being slightly corrected, without being destroyed. You saw it yourself, I had to punish the rebels, but they are still themselves. Jargus here is the man you first met, while also being my loyal servant and now close friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riefclaw&#39;s hand reaches Jargus&#39;s chest. The lion giving an affectionate pat to the older wolf. Jargus beaming as the king touches him, enjoying the affection, before he&#39;s roughly snapped back to reality as the king continues to thrust.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for expanding... let me ask you Nate. You have seen both sides of the story, you were once a man and now you were a beast. What do you think is better? Being a beast? Or being a man?&quot;<br />
<br />
You seriously contemplate that question. You really have seen it all by now, the good and the bad. There&#39;s no concrete truth, no fully right side, and you&#39;re not even sure if this is a loaded question or not. Deciding to answer honestly, you speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a beast, we can be true to ourselves. We are changed a bit, altered to suit our role and needs. But... everyone is happy and together. I can&#39;t help but think it&#39;s the better life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riefclaw seems satisfied by your answer. His body pressing against Jargus once more, the wolf knocked to the ground as the king exits him. Jargus rolling over, his large chest rising and falling as the king strokes himself. His seed shooting in the air, before landing on Jargus&#39;s chest. The wolfs entire torsos completely white in moments as he collects the kings seed. The wolf stepping away shortly after as Riefclaw sits on his throne.<br />
<br />
&quot;A good answer my friend, a good answer. I wish to bring everyone into my kingdom, for it is the perfect one. This will cause war and resistance, they will refuse, but they will all succumb. After all, it is far too easy to turn a man. They will see how perfect our life is, and willingly join our cause. They just need a... nudge in the right direction. When we have conquered kingdom after kingdom, I plan to hand over rulership of our new territories to my children. Yeron, the first of my family, and many other lords to join him as brothers. From then... it is their choice. They may decide that humans can reside in their lands without being converted, or they can join me in turning the world. I will respect their decision, even if it is to harbour humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel a bit better after hearing that. Maybe Riefclaw isn&#39;t as bad as you expected, he does seem to have a genuinely good wish for the world. Slight mind control is a small price to pay for unity and perfection, right? Though maybe this is him just toying with you, maybe you&#39;re more far gone than you thought. You have felt odd ever since entering this throne room. Riefclaw&#39;s scent clawing itself into you, his bulky body taunting you. You understand just how easily the others fell now, being before a mighty king makes you want to kneel. To obey and crawl, service and submit. Riefclaw sees your situation, the king stroking himself once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, you have done far better for yourself than any other beast or rebel. Yet you have not fully embraced the curse yet. I will warn you now, the longer you wait, the worse this will get. If you give in to the curse, deciding to join us fully... you will submit to the nearest beast around. Your body being tied to that man eternally, think of how Jargus now worships my cock whenever he is free from work. If you wish to continue your life, then leave and keep your amulet. If you want to be with my son, then seek him out. I would prefer that my son has you to himself, yet if you crave me...&quot;<br />
<br />
His dick throbs once, Riefclaw grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then start sucking.&quot;</p>
