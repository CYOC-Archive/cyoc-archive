<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So you heard this story from who again?” Diana asked,<br />
“I read it in a book! It’s not far, honestly,” Karen explained, turning the laptop to show Diana. The screen displayed what looked like a fairytale drawing. With respect, artwork was pretty good… just not an actual photo,<br />
“Seriously?”<br />
“It’s real! I’m telling you, plus it’s only like an hour away.”<br />
“What’s the walk after driving?” Diana asked,<br />
“A-another hour…” she giggled,<br />
“You owe me sooooo many coffee’s after this.”<br />
<br />
Two and a half hours later, they finally arrived at the location, an hour walk ahead of them.<br />
“I cannot believe I let you drag me into this,” Diana complained,<br />
“Hey! This isn’t that bad, it’s a cute day it even if this is fake.”<br />
“So you admit, you think this is fake.” Diana says, almost trying to make Karen doubt herself and they turn back around and leave,<br />
“Nope. I think this place is real, I can feel it,”<br />
“Whatever,” Diana complains. She grabs her backpack and swings it around her back, “I just hope at least there’s a spring there, I bought my bathing suit for this.”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“So what exactly are you gonna wish for?” Diana asked idly, minding where she walks as they travel deeper and deeper into the forest,<br />
“I’m not sure… it’s a big question.” Karen replies absentmindedly,<br />
“WHAT!?” Diana says in shock,<br />
“W-what…?” Karen replied, stopping her tracks,<br />
“You came to the ‘grand old magic wishing spring’ without any idea of what to wish for?”<br />
“Well it’s a big question!”<br />
“Then think of a big answer!” Diana says,<br />
“Well I’ll just wish for good grades so I get into college.”<br />
“College… seriously. If this thing actually grants wishes, you’re gonna wish for good grades?”<br />
“Yeah. What’s wrong with that?”<br />
“Nothing particularly, just seems like a waste of a wish to me.” Diana says, stepping ahead of Karen, wandering deeper into the forest,<br />
“Hold on!” Karen says, walking after Diana who is clearly not stopping, “you already know what you’re gonna wish for?”<br />
“No idea,” Diana says, disappearing behind a large cluster of vines, “I don’t even think this place is real.” Her voice echo’s,<br />
“Stop being so negative all the time!” Karen argues.<br />
Diana doesn’t reply. Karen looks on, confused. She catches up to the vines, trying to find where her best friend went<br />
“Diana?” Karen yells, getting a little worried, “Diana!?” She yells a little louder.<br />
<br />
As she turns the corner, she finds Diana, standing on the edge of something. As she gets closer, she sees what Diana is looking down upon,<br />
“I hate to say you were right…” Diana sighs, starting to walk down the small stone path,<br />
“Wow!” Karen says in wonder as her eyes meet an absolutely gorgeous spring. There’s stone blocks all around a large pool of water. The water looks incredible, she could even say it looked as if it was sparkling.<br />
“This is amazing!” Karen says,<br />
“Yeah,” Diana agrees, half-upset that Karen was right all along, but half-pleased she gets to chill in a gorgeous spring.<br />
<br />
Diana already starts to get changed into her bathing suit, a two piece blue bikini,<br />
“Do you have to get your huge tits out in front of me every time I see you?”<br />
“Yes,” Diana replied, “yes I do.”<br />
Diana finished putting on her bikini and dipped her toe into the water, “wow…” she said,<br />
“Does it feel as nice as it looks?”<br />
“Honestly, it feels better!” She said, putting her whole foot into the water.<br />
Karen took off her shoes and put them to one side, taking off her shirt to reveal her cropped tank top,<br />
“Did you not bring a top?” Diana asked,<br />
“I did, it’s in my bag.” Karen replied, putting both her feet into the water and sighing with pleasure,<br />
“Dumbass. Put it on.” Diana said. She made her way over to Karen’s bag and started digging around inside for Karen’s bikini.<br />
<br />
“Oh Great Wishing Spring, I wish for good grades and to get into the college I want to get into!” Karen wished. The pool did seem to shimmer, but it wasn’t noticeable to either girl, brushing it off as the sun,<br />
“Pretty selfish wish if you ask me,” Diana says,<br />
“What!” Karen says, defensively, “I’m just… I kinda need those grades.”<br />
“I need good grades too!” Diana says, “but you can work for those, why not wish to solve world hunger, or global peace, or even for your family to be healthy or something.”<br />
“What if I wished you weren’t always so hungry.” Karen teased,<br />
“Hey!” Diana shouted back, “I just like food, don’t need to judge me.”<br />
“Sure, it’s a shock you’re not already a fat cow!” Karen teased even harder, pretty much insulting her,<br />
“What the hell!” Diana said, clearly genuinely offended. She pulled out Karen’s bikini and threw it on the ground, “that was mean…” she said, walking back to her own bag,<br />
“H-hey I didn’t mean it… I just got excited. I don’t wish that, I wish you were exactly as you are.”<br />
“Th-thanks… you did go a little too far,” Diana said, “so I wish you pay for your actions!” She chants in a jokingly deep voice, “I wish you are burdened with the curse of ‘Extreme Motherhood!!’”<br />
“And you wonder why we don’t have other friends.” Karen said, cocking her hand on her hips,<br />
“We don’t need other friends. You’ve got me and my big ol’ tiddies, and I’ve got you are your… y-your… wait…” Diana’s tone quickly changes as she looks down at Karen’s abdomen,<br />
“What?” Karen asks, looking down, her eyes widen, “OH MY GOD!” She screams as she sees her belly rising like dough in an oven!<br />
<br />
Karen looks forward as Diana, who is in equal shock, but not quite the same level of distress,<br />
“This can’t be happening!” Karen yells as her belly swells beyond her breasts. As her belly grows, she finds that things are starting to feel weird. She groans and bends backwards and suddenly her hips start to expand outwards, her bones reforming and becoming significantly wider. Along with this, her butt seems to getting bigger. She turns her head over her shoulder and watches as it expands, stretching her shorts more and more until one of the buttons flies off and her flies undo. Her legs start growing thicker, and even her feet seem to be swelling a little. She looks back up at Diana, who looks almost terrified of what she’s done,<br />
“What’s happening to me!” Karen yells, looking down at her belly, growing bigger and bigger, her belly button popping right out as she looks to be almost nine-months, with virtually no stop in sight.<br />
Following this, she feels a pressure in her breasts, at first, her nipples start to tent her top more and more, but soon they just start getting bigger. Her breasts begin to swell, clearly filling with breast-milk, starting to leak through her tank-top. As her breasts swell more and more, getting heavier and fuller, they begin to rest on top of her already huge belly.<br />
“DIANA!” She screams, “DO SOMETHING! I DON’T WANT TO GIVE BIRTH!” She says as she feels something inside of her moving.<br />
Her face starts to swell, getting puffier, rounder.<br />
<br />
Diana looks on in horror as her once average looking friend quickly swells into what can only be described as an exaggerated milf! She looks to be the same age, but her body is so bloated and huge… and oddly sexy. Diana hates that her friend is in trouble, but a part of her is getting a little turned on watching her friend in front of her become this godlike symbol of fertility,<br />
“D-d-d…” Diana stutters, panicking under stress, Karen still swelling more and more by the second, her clothing looking to burst at any second, “I WISH YOU WEREN’T PREGNANT! I WISH YOUR BELLY IS NORMAL AND YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT!!!” Diana shouts, closing her eyes.<br />
<br />
Karen feels the water sparkle at her legs as the pressure quickly subsides. Immediately, her huge belly starts to regress back into her stomach, her breasts start to shrink, as do her feet, her hands, her face…<br />
But as her pregnant belly finally disappears, Karen looks down at her body,<br />
“Uhm…” she says.<br />
Diana opens one eye, seeing that Karen is not nearly as bloated as she once was, but she’s definitely not back to normal, “oh my god.” Diana says, putting her hand over her mouth,<br />
“I-I’m so big…”<br />
“Huge…” Diana says, “I’m so sorry! I didn’t think this spring would work!!”<br />
“Me neither…” Karen agrees, taking one step forward and feeling her huge ass jiggle, her thighs rub against one-another, and her hips cause her to waddle a little, “h-how do I look?”<br />
“S-sexy…” Diana said, unable to take her eyes off her best friend,<br />
“Diana!” Karen says, “wish me back to normal,”<br />
“R-right… I wish Karen was back to normal— h-how she was when we first arrived.” Diana says, wishing with all her might.<br />
<br />
“N-nothing’s happening,” Karen said, “I’m still huge! Diana! I’m freaking out!!!”<br />
“Don’t! It’s okay… I wish I was four inches taller,” Diana said. Once again, nothing, “I think I’m out of wishes.”<br />
“S-so how do we get more!?”<br />
“Can’t you make a wish?” Diana asked,<br />
“O-oh… right,” Karen said, a little embarrassed that she forgot, “I wish… Diana’s boobs were bigger!”<br />
<br />
“HEY!” Diana shouts, immediately feeling an odd pressure in her breasts, she looks down and watches as her already big, double D cup breasts start to stretch her bikini, “stop it! I wish they would stop!” She chants, but they keep growing. Her breasts swell more, becoming E’s, quickly F’s. Soon, her bikini top gives up. Luckily she’s done a pretty terrible job of tying her bikini at the back as it simply unties itself and falls forward, revealing her much larger breats.<br />
As they approach the G cup, they start to slow, before reaching their final size. They were the size of her head.<br />
“What the hell was that!” Diana shouts, her breasts jiggling at pretty much every movement,<br />
“It was payback!” Karen shouts back, “LOOK AT MY BODY! YOU THINK YOU DON’T DESERVE!!” She shouts, angrily, every word vibrating her body just a little, causing small movements all around.<br />
<br />
“O-okay…” Diana says, “I admit, I did deserve that. But at least you’re sexy!”<br />
“HOW!? How is ‘this’ sexy!?” Karen gestures to her whole body, “I look like some MILF! It’s so gross… I even think my pussy got bigger, it’s so uncomfortable,” she says, adjusting her shorts, accidentally causing them to rip a little more at her back, “oops…” <br />
<br />
“Wish yourself back to normal then, and then fix my tits. I wanna leave.”<br />
“Sure.” Karen says with a mocking tone, “I wish that Diana’s body is exactly as I described it.” She says with a smirk on her face.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing…” Diana says, immediately feeling something changing. She looks down, only to find her massive breasts blocking any view of what could be happening. She feels around, placing her hand on her stomach, hoping to any god that she wouldn’t end up pregnant.<br />
But instead, she found a little pudge. Her belly, it seemed to be getting bigger…<br />
“Do we have to do this, Karen?” Diana asked. But Karen stayed silent.<br />
She watched as Diana’s midsection become squishier and pudgier, followed by the rest of her body becoming just a little chubbier. Her face swelling a little, her butt growing, her legs, generally a little fatter.<br />
But things started to feel weird when Diana’s breasts started changing.<br />
Her exposed nipples started growing. Her areola spreading wider as her nipples got longer and thicker. Almost immediately milk started to trickle out of them. But before long, the trickling turned to spraying, to straight up pouring!<br />
“KAREN!” Diana yelled, only able to watch as her already huge breasts poured milk right onto the ground in front of her. As she took a step back, she could feel her feet had changed, harder hooves replaced her as her legs rose a little, thickening too. Her skin developed some large patches of what could only be described as cow spots. She groaned as the lower half of her bikini snapped from the pressure of her growing waist and widening hips, followed by a long tail protruding out of her backside.<br />
Her breasts started to swell more as Karen noticed nipples appearing right below her navel, growing quickly to form a pink squishy udder that rapidly filled with milk, hanging down and beginning to leak as much as her breasts.<br />
“THIS IS ENOUGH!” Diana yelled, trying to hold up her breasts with her changing hands, “YOU’VE HAD ENOUGH!” She screamed, falling forward onto her hands. Her hands formed into hooves and her arms thickened, growing to support her growing body. Her torso thickened too, looking more and more like a cow.<br />
She looked up at Karen, her mouth and nose forming a more cow-like shape and two ivory horns started protruding out of her head. She tried to speak, but could say only one thing…<br />
<br />
“Moo…” </p>
