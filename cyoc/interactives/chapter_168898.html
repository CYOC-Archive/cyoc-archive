<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Possession&quot; He was staring at the stars and turned his head to the heavy breathing next to him.<br />
In the light of the fire, he saw her mouth move but heard no words. Her head turned to him. &quot;You dirty little pervert.&quot; She said with a smile as she pulled the dildo from her vagina. &quot;I&#39;m beat, what did you do?&quot; <br />
He couldn&#39;t make out the last part as she dozed off.<br />
He got up and covered her up with a blanket before turning in as well. His own body now felt much more energetic than her body when he left it. He sat at the fire, contemplating what he&#39;d done. The things he&#39;d said. He&#39;d enjoyed it a lot more than he&#39;s expected. Was he kinky? Or was that Vivian&#39;s body influencing his mind. <br />
He&#39;d already gotten familiar with the carnal desires every body he&#39;d possessed seemed to have. How strong could a body&#39;s grip on his, no any mind be? Truth be told, it was a bit scary to him. Before all this, he was Alec the hetero sexual guy with a healthy interest in the opposite sex. Now, he was Alec the guy with a vagina that seemed to want to be penetrated. Almost like it had a mind of it&#39;s own.<br />
He&#39;d been a horny naked harpy, he&#39;d been Amber the fairly average girl before his interesting and normally impossible adaptations and now he&#39;d been Vivian. The slightly kinky cursed six breasted woman who could kick his ass all day long without breaking a sweat. Each body felt completely different. He found himself yearning for his old familiar body. As exciting as this all could be, the thought of at least recognizing his own body was overpowering. <br />
He missed it, he missed him. He turned in and slowly fell asleep.<br />
<br />
He awoke the following morning to the sight of Vivians back as she fastened her make-shift sextuple bra back on. &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
She turned and smiled. &quot;Yes. Like a baby. You seem to have had quite the party yesterday. I had this crazy dream that you fucked me, but I know that you can&#39;t right now. Besides, you obviously used something else.&quot; <br />
Alec quickly zipped up his pants underneath his blanket.<br />
Vivian just kept smiling. &quot;So how was it? Learn anything?&quot;<br />
A whole range of emotions took turns to coming up in his mind. It was fascinating, it was hot, it was great, it was different, it was confusing, it was a lot of things. &quot;It was hot.&quot;<br />
&quot;How did I compare?&quot;<br />
Wait, was this one of those moments where you shouldn&#39;t be honest and just praise the girl in front of you? Not that she was bad, but it was different. She had larger tits, her vagina felt more eager yet Amber had been much more sensitive and more malleable.&quot;You were way better?&quot;<br />
Vivian snickered as she got out of bed and started folding her blanket, &quot;Riiiight, and now for the real answer.&quot;<br />
&quot;It was different. You felt different than the other girl. She was more sensitive somehow.&quot;<br />
She seemed a little disappointed.<br />
&quot;B..but you have much better t..breasts though.&quot; Was that something girls wanted to hear?<br />
&quot;You mean I have six. You like them big and plentiful, you dirty little pervert you.&quot; She winked and got up. <br />
Alec felt his face flush red, but something was bothering him. He studied Vivian for a moment as she went about her business. &quot;Did you get shorter?&quot;  <br />
Vivian looked down at herself. &quot;Apparently yes. Explains why these feel different.&quot; She tugged at her bra construction trying to get it to fit tighter.<br />
Alec got up. Vivian had been only slightly shorter than he was, but now her head came to his shoulders. Her breasts also seemed bigger, but that might just be the smaller frame.<br />
She pulled up her shorts, but left some room near her lower back. A small pink tail was sticking out just above her ass crack.<br />
He just stared as Vivian gathered up her stuff and cleaned up the campsite. <br />
&quot;Come, let&#39;s get a move on. I told you the curse was still progressing, I don&#39;t want to waste more time.&quot; She pulled the braces Alec had found out of her pack and put them on. &quot;And make sure you have your weapons at the ready.&quot; She tied her a narrow blade to each of her thigh. After she struggled to properly fasten her chest armor again.<br />
Shaken Alec complied and started packing.<br />
<br />
After breakfast they started their journey. It took some getting used to Vivian being shorter, mostly in the eye contact department. Looking down, he felt his stupid eyes constantly drawn to her impressive cleavage. But she was obviously still Vivian. She held a brisk pace, while she talked at length about her dream where she spent an entire evening humping Alec, leaving him flustered.<br />
The weather was perfect for hiking, warm with a cool breeze. Large white clouds occasionally drifted by the sun, making sure it never got to hot. This allowed them to make good time as they traveled the whole day before finally ending at a lake. Vivian stopped them at a small cluster of trees near the edge of the water.<br />
&quot;This is where I stopped last time as well.&quot; Vivian dropped her pack to the ground next to a rock and a large tree. Alec crashed on the ground, he&#39;d never walked this much in his previous life. His feet were killing him, he needed to invest in a horse.<br />
She sat down on the rock and stretched her back, sticking her chest forward. Alec was trying his hardest not to look. &quot;My back is killing me.&quot;<br />
She looked at the lake and got up. &quot;Okay, I know what I need.&quot;<br />
She pulled her armor off, dropped her shorts and took off her bra&#39;s, leaving her with nothing except her thong. With both arms crossed before her chest she said &quot;You keep watch, you can have a turn after me.&quot; She dashed towards the water and dove in.<br />
Alec watched her go. Pressure had been building in his bladder, this was the perfect opportunity.<br />
<br />
He shuffled off to take a piss near a tree where he could still see her, but hopefully she could not see him. <br />
He dropped his pants around his ankles, in the past few days he&#39;d gotten a lot more familiar with this. He lowered himself in a squatting position and let it go.<br />
He pulled his pants back up to his knees and stepped away. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
He jumped upright and spun around. Vivian&#39;s short naked form stood before him, water dripping from her naked body. She had one of her narrow short swords in hand.<br />
&quot;I told you to...&quot; her voice trailed off and he followed her gaze to his exposed mound. He gasped and quickly pulled up his pants, his face started burning.<br />
She didn&#39;t smile, she didn&#39;t joke, her eyes were hard.<br />
&quot;Listen I..&quot; <br />
&quot;No, shut up.&quot; She held up her knife. &quot;I told you to keep watch. You can&#39;t just disappear like that and leave myself and yourself exposed like this here. From here on out don&#39;t do that. Let me know where you&#39;re going and I&#39;m doing the same.&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t the witch still a day away?&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s more in the world than witches and the further you get from the cities, the more dangerous it gets. I&#39;m going to get dressed, do you want to go take a bath?&quot;<br />
He meekly followed, undressed to his boxers and dove into the lake. The whole time he felt Vivian watching him from the shore. <br />
<br />
As night fell they made a campfire, sitting on opposite sides they ate their dinner. Sitting at the fire Vivian started talking again.<br />
&quot;Just to be clear. I meant what I said. We wouldn&#39;t be the first adventurers to have their stuff stolen while swimming, or bitten by snake while doing their business while no one is nearby to help. Is that clear?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. I thought that this wouldn&#39;t be such a problem. I could still see you.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I couldn&#39;t see you and I didn&#39;t know where you were. You should&#39;ve waited or at the absolute very least let me know what you were doing.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
&quot;I accept, now let&#39;s put this behind us.&quot; A misschievous grin crept on Vivian&#39;s face. &quot;You know, mine&#39;s better looking.&quot;<br />
He looked up at her, &quot;What do you...&quot; as he realized what she was talking about his face turned red again, at this point it felt like this was his natural complexion.<br />
&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be like that. Like I said, everyone gets cursed once in a while. I&#39;ve never seen that one before though. Pretty karmic from that witch.&quot; She laughed. &quot;I can&#39;t believe that you tried to hide that. Damn man, you must be one experience man in the bed by now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like it.&quot; was all he managed.<br />
&quot;Of course you don&#39;t like it, who ever does. But look here, I&#39;m turning into a freak and you&#39;re just a human looking cuntboy. Now who&#39;s got it the toughest?&quot; She laughed, &quot;But on the other hand you probably miss peeing standing up? No wonder your toilet breaks always took so long. Trying to figure out how the plumbing works?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really not nearly as easy as a dick. Always with the crouching and then there&#39;s tall grass.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, preaching to the choir.&quot; She raised her hand. &quot;I&#39;d love to try out being a man once. There are spells for that, but they&#39;re expensive and dangerous. So I think I&#39;ll stick to what I know and what I&#39;m good at.&quot; she winked.<br />
&quot;Well I can&#39;t wait to my dick back. This just feels so weird.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve said it before, but I&#39;m jealous of your skill. You can just try out whatever you want, though you should probably be more careful with wizards and witches next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vivian leaned forward, her eyes peered through the fire and into his as she spoke in a sweet and sultry tone. &quot;You know, I could probably teach you a thing or two about your vagina.&quot;</p>
