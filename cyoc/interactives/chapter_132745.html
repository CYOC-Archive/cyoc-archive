<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was 6.30. Someone was knocking on my door. “Wake up sleepyhead” It was Sarah. What was she doing here?<br />
<br />
I stumbled out of bed and opened the door. Sarah, Mum and Dad were in the hallway and gave me a rendition of Happy birthday. <br />
<br />
I gave them each a hug. It was a bit awkward hugging Dad as my chemise had a very lacy and revealing bodice, but I was his daughter. Mum suggested I put a gown on and come to the kitchen so they could give me my presents.<br />
<br />
When I got to the kitchen Dad was proudly standing beside what looked like a very ornate small cupboard about 40 cm high and 50 cm across. “It’s a jewellery box, Happy birthday” I gave him another hug and had a good look at the box. He had clearly made it himself and it was beautiful. There were 5 drawers in the middle and he demonstrated how the sides opened to reveal spaces where I could hang my necklaces. <br />
<br />
Sarah then handed me a small wrapped present. Saying it was a gift from both herself and Mum. I opened it to reveal an Amber necklace. Mum explained that it was Baltic amber. The stones varied in size and shape. The largest ones were about 4 cm diameter. It looked expensive. I gave both of them a hug and got Sarah to put it around my neck. <br />
<br />
Mum said she had one more present for me and handed me another wrapped package. I opened it to reveal a lacy white top. Mum said she bought it to go with my tan skirt and that I should wear it today. She got yet another hug.<br />
<br />
I was feeling very special, this is what it is like to have a proper family.<br />
<br />
We sat down and ate breakfast together. Once finished Mum suggested I go and have a shower but don’t wash my hair. She said I should wear a plain white slip under my top. Sarah said she would go and hoped to see me tonight. She asked me to give her a call as soon as I knew my fate.<br />
<br />
I returned to my room and found a white bra and panty set and a white satin slip. I took these into the bathroom and showered. I used the razor to clean up a few whiskers on my underarms and legs.<br />
<br />
I then returned to my room and dressed. The top had short sleeves and a full neck. I could see why Mum had suggested the slip. It was rather see-through. I put everything on except mums jacket then went to the bathroom and applied my make-up. I thought I was ready so sat down in front of the TV with Dad who was watching the morning news. <br />
<br />
Mum saw me there. She was dressed up herself and told me to go back to the bathroom, she wanted to fix my hair. I did as I was told and she said she was going to ‘Twist my hair into an updo’ I had little idea what she meant but trusted she knew more about hair care than I did. I sat in a chair and watched in the mirror as she worked on me. She started by creating a ponytail, actually 3 ponytails. Then using pins and what she called a ‘Hair Bungees’ somehow tied my hair into an attractive looking bun. She did everything too fast for me to follow.<br />
<br />
When she had finished she said: ”You need different earrings” I had put in some gold, dangly, feather shaped earrings. “Wait here”. She returned a minute later with two white pearl stud earrings which she replaced the gold earring with. ‘I like that”<br />
<br />
I gathered I was finally ready so put the gold earrings away, picked up the jacket and my handbag. Mum was ready as well she was going to come to the lawyers and spend the day with me. Dad was going to come once I was in court to support me. <br />
<br />
Mum drove to the lawyers. We both entered and were told to wait for Mr Price. He took us into his office and went through the procedures for the day. He said we would head over to the court house at 10 O’clock. He expected we might need to wait for an hour or more before my case would be called. Once inside it would probably take 5 minutes or less. I was to sit at the table with him. And stand when the magistrate entered or addressed me. And address her as ‘Your Honor”<br />
<br />
He asked how my job was going. I told him it had been extended for 6 months. He was pleased. He said he thought it should be just a formality that I would receive a fine. It being my 1st offence. However he said it was important that I was still respectful to the magistrate. He complimented me on what I was wearing “That is a good choice of outfits, much better than what you wore last time” I really needed to find out what Jenna had worn. <br />
<br />
He dismissed us for the moment and told us to go to a waiting room at the chambers where we could make ourselves a coffee. He would fetch us when it was time to go to the courthouse which was only 200 meters away.<br />
<br />
I had butterflies in my stomach during the wait. That hour seemed to go on forever. Eventually Mr Price stuck his head in and invited us to walk across to the courthouse with him.<br />
<br />
Once there we had another wait. Mr Price took us to a private room where we sat. I spent my time reading a newspaper Mr Price had brought with him. Dad arrived and joined us at about 10.30. At about 11.15 a man stuck his head through the door and whispered something to Mr Price. He told us to come with him. We went out to the main waiting room. I guessed many of the other people there were also awaiting their time in court. Most were dressed up.<br />
<br />
We were there about 15 minutes when a clerk announced we were to enter the court. I followed Mr Price in and sat at the table beside him. A policeman was at another table. He nodded to me. I nodded back. Mum and Dad sat in the seats at the back of the room. There were about 5 other people also in the room. I did not know who they were. Maybe they were there for another case.<br />
<br />
We were asked to stand as the magistrate entered. She was a 50ish woman in normal business type clothes. I had been expecting her to wear a gown and a wig.<br />
<br />
It was over in a trice. She asked the policeman and Mr Price if they had anything further to add. Mr Price checked that she had received my psychological assessment. She had. I was asked to stand. <br />
<br />
“Miss McKenzie, you are a perplexing case. I have found it hard to understand the motivation for your crime. I am pleased that you appear remorseful and are now employed. You have pleaded guilty and I will impose a fine of 5 penalty units. No conviction to be recorded. You are dismissed. I do not want to see you here again” <br />
<br />
“Thank-you your Honor”<br />
<br />
That was it. I was free. I looked at Mr Price. He stood up as the magistrate left the room. Once she had gone we left the table and walked outside. Mum and Dad gave me a hug. Dad shook Mr Price’s hand. I did as well. We went back to the room where we had waited. Mr Price explained that I would receive a fine in the mail. It would be for about $800. I suspected his own bill might be higher. He explained that were I to re-offend I would not get off so lightly. Although I had not officially been convicted, I did now have a criminal record. He said we were free to go.<br />
<br />
Mum and Dad said they wanted to take me out to lunch to celebrate. We took Mum’s car home then drove to a café near the gardens. On the way I rang Sarah to tell her the outcome. She said she would see me tonight. I took Mum’s jacket off as it was a lovely day, leaving it in the car. We sat at an outdoor table and I had satay chicken skewers and a glass of white wine. Dad insisted on paying. I was feeling very relieved.<br />
<br />
While we were finishing our meals a group of businessmen entered the café and took a nearby table. I couldn’t help notice that Alan Penberthy was with them. He noticed me and gave me a smile and a nod. I flashed a smile back at him. He excused himself to his friends and came across to say hello to Mum, Dad and myself. He must have met Mum and Dad at the funeral as they knew who he was. When asked what we were doing here Dad said he was taking me out to lunch to celebrate my birthday. Alan looked at me and said “Happy birthday” <br />
<br />
I flashed him my brightest smile and said “Thank-you” Oh no, I shouldn’t have said that. It hit again I had to restrain myself from standing up and kissing him. Fortunately he was at the other side of the table standing behind Mum and Dad. Nevertheless I must have flushed deeply. <br />
<br />
Mum asked “Are you alright?”<br />
<br />
I tried to pretend nothing had happened. Alan went back to the other table and sat with his friends. <br />
<br />
Shortly afterwards the waitress approached with a bottle of champagne. “Compliments from the gentlemen at the other table” she said. I looked across, Alan gave me another smile. <br />
<br />
Mum kicked me under the table. “You have an admirer. Go and thank him”<br />
<br />
I restrained myself from calling out thank-you. There must be some other words I could use to express that sentiment. I got up and walked across to his table. All the men were looking at me. The best I could think of was “Alan, I really do appreciate the gift, you are very thoughtful” I again gave him my best smile. <br />
<br />
I returned to our table and we each had a glass of the champagne. It was very nice. When finished we left the table and Dad went to pay the bill. I waited with Mum around the corner in a shady spot. We were out of sight of Alan’s table but I could still hear one of the men asking “Who’s the babe?” I blushed yet again.<br />
<br />
We drove home, I was in the back seat. Mum said to Dad “Jenna has an admirer and I think the feeling is mutual” She turned around and looked at me. “I caught you blushing a couple of times” She had a big smile on her own face. “Have you two been seeing each other?”<br />
<br />
“No, I met him at the funeral, that’s the only time”<br />
<br />
“Well he seems a huge improvement from your past boyfriends”<br />
<br />
I was silent. I sat in the back and listened as Mum and Dad discussed some of my previous boyfriends. They were not complimentary. Eventually I had to stop them “Mum, your embarrassing me. I’ve moved on”<br />
<br />
She spoke no more about the subject<br />
<br />
Once home, Mum declared she was cooking a cake for my birthday. While Dad went to his shed. I carried my new jewellery box to my room and placed it to the left of my dressing table then spent a couple of hours sorting out Jenna’s jewellery and deciding in which part of the box everything would live. I now owned some nice pieces. But quite a bit I suspected was fake. I put my new amber necklace around my neck. I also took out Mum’s pearl earrings and replaced them with some pendant pearls that Jenna owned. I returned Mum her earrings and jacket.<br />
<br />
I received text messages from Em and Gabby wishing me happy birthday and a phone call from Shaz. I wasn&#39;t sure whether she knew about the court case so didn&#39;t raise the subject. She and Em had gone out on Saturday night. She said they were missing me. I told her I would be away next weekend as well, explaining my trip with Monique. She said it sounded like I would have a great weekend and wished she could come with me.<br />
<br />
I checked my facebook. There was a message from Katie C reminding me that the last dancing lesson was this Thursday night. I was to wear clubbing gear again.<br />
<br />
There were two friend requests from Sarah and Amy the dentist. I accepted both of them. I put in a friend request to Amanda.<br />
I ended up posting a selfie of myself showing my new top and necklace. I don&#39;t really know why I did that. When I was Zach I rarely posted anything. Maybe it was because I was so pleased with my gifts. <br />
<br />
Sarah came over straight from work. I took her to my room and showed how I had filled my jewellery box. She pointed out a couple of pieces that she recalled I had received  from Mum and Dad on previous birthdays, including a very nice sapphire necklace I was given for my 21st. She also mentioned that some of the earrings were hers, that she thought she had lost and we now assumed Jenna had stolen. I insisted she take them back.<br />
  <br />
At dinner we had a roast leg of lamb and it was delicious. The three of them sang happy birthday again as I blew out candles and cut the cake.  It found my eyes watering with delight. It had been an almost perfect day. I was enjoying being part of a loving family. After dinner we had a family game of Scrabble, Mum suggested it saying I used to love the game when I was younger. However I was no match for Dad who seemed a bit of an expert.<br />
<br />
Sarah went home at 9 and I retired shortly afterwards. Once in bed I read another chapter of my book. Charlotte, now resigned to her role of a housemaid tried to learn the local french dialect. The old cook took pity on her and gave her rudimentary lessons. At least she could now partially communicate with her fellow servants. At Christmas she attended a dance with the other servants at the local village. She found herself dancing with one of the villagers who she discovered was the cooks nephew. He was smelly and worked as a stable hand. <br />
3 days later she was called in to attend to Lady Jehanne. The former Jane told her that she had given Louis the stablehand permission to marry Charlotte. This intended betrothal was news to Charlotte. She had only had two dances with the man and she objected. However Lady Jehanne declared her word was final. The banns would be proclaimed at church for the next 3 Sundays and that in one months time the wedding would take place.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was enough. It had been a wonderful day. I turned off the light</p>
