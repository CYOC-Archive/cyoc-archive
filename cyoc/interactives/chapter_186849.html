<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After an 8 hour sleep Rick and Darcy awoke in their beds with Darcy looking like a nice milf in her early thirties. Rick got out of bed and went to the bathroom to splash some water on his face. The man&#39;s body in his early forties looked in the mirror and was only half surprised that this version of him had given up the fight on male pattern baldness and just decided to shave the top of his head... Honestly while it was a bit of a surprise it didn&#39;t look half bad. He then walked downstairs and looked at everyone at the breakfast table. There was his aging mother looking more and more like a grandmother with each passing hour who seemed to have prepared a nice breakfast of eggs and bacon. Meanwhile there was Olivia in one corner who looked like she was in her early teens maybe 12 or 13? Then there was a young boy of maybe 6 or 7 years old... who kinda reminded Rick of himself when he was... Thinking back at last night Darcy and him did forget the condom... Did he seriously get Darcy pregnant again and she gave birth in her sleep?<br />
Rick sat down at his usual spot and said &quot;Good morning.&quot; <br />
&quot;Morning daddy.&quot; Olivia said and then Renee gave a good hello as well. <br />
The boy was still eating a slice of bacon and then Renee said &quot;Jr! First off smaller bites, Second greet your father!&quot; <br />
Apparently Rick Jr. chomped off the bacon slice, swallowed and said &quot;Sorry, morning dad.&quot; a little bit softly. Shortly after Darcy went downstairs and started to make a little coffee<br />
Olivia asked &quot;Mom... um could I maybe try a little coffee?&quot; Darcy at first looked like she was on the edge of saying yes or no. Rick himself would probably have said no or diluted it enough with milk that you couldn&#39;t realistically call it coffee, but as he looked at Olivia he saw her breasts swell a cup as she gained a few inches in height in less than a minute. Olivia seemed to squirm a little bit as if she noticed her body changing, but apparently with enough time passing Darcy went to make some coffee for their daughter who must&#39;ve been less than a day old. <br />
Jack mumbled to himself &quot;I wish time would stop for now...&quot; His original wish had come true, and probably a bit more than he had intended. At this point it seemed like nearly thirty years had passed in just a day, and he suspected that if he went back to the porn site it would be asking &quot;Are you 18 hours old?&quot; instead of years. Darcy finished up the coffee and gave a coffee with a lot of milk and sugar to Olivia, and a much darker one for herself. <br />
Renee got up and said &quot;You going to finish that up soon? We got that spa appointment to go to.&quot;<br />
Olivia who was taking a sip had her eyes widen and put the cup down in front of Jack as she said &quot;Right, honey could you finish that for me?&quot;<br />
Jack said &quot;Sure, I guess...&quot; said the middle-aged man who was a 17 year old inside who never experienced ingesting coffee before. Renee for sure looked almost ready to get going to a spa, and Olivia would probably take another year to get ready at this rate. Jack chuckled thinking about all the times he heard his dad say something similar, but this time he could say it literally. Jr and Olivia had finished up their breakfast faster than Jack, and Jr left for the television to go ahead and watch something. Olivia on the other hand took out a smartphone after bringing her and her brother&#39;s dishes to the sink and started to look at something on her phone. Jack somewhat enjoyed this time with his daughter and wanted to spend as much time as he could while his daughter could still be somewhat considered a child. Jack had finished his meal and then went to the sink and decided to do the dishes. He then noticed the weird ring he had found the other day was still on his hand, and took it off while doing the dishes. <br />
About half an hour had passed after Jack had made his new wish and he was almost through them when a &quot;Daddy! Something weird is happening with my body!&quot; Jack coughed a bit as he panicked, wasn&#39;t Olivia already going through puberty and already taught the birds and the bees thing? Or was that Jr&#39;s voice and he would need the talk already?!?<br />
It turned out to be Olivia and Jack asked &quot;What&#39;s wrong Olivia?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve stopped growing, maybe I have some weird disease or something?&quot;<br />
&quot;Stopped growing?...&quot; now that he thought about it enough time had passed that he suspected Olivia should&#39;ve maybe gone through a growth spurt or two in some way at the current... Did the aging rate change again? &quot;Wait, were you aware of everyone aging quickly?&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you talking about daddy? I&#39;ve been aging at the same rate as everyone else, but now I think I&#39;ve stopped. I don&#39;t want to be this small my entire life!&quot;<br />
&quot;Mind if I asked how old you are again?&quot;<br />
&quot;I should be a day old in a couple of hours.&quot; She said proudly<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Jack thought about how she seemed to be aware of the change in aging rate though and continued his testing &quot;Out of curiosity, do you have a bunch of school friends?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah I&#39;ve got a handful of them li-&quot;<br />
&quot;Hold it right there. Now can you answer this question. Have you actually gone to school yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why Y-... Umm... wait... I know I think I&#39;ve gone to classes and the knowledge but... No I was born at the hospital, came home, had some fun with my cousin, slept, and well here we are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Seems like you are somewhat aware of our predicament.&quot; <br />
&quot;So do you know what&#39;s going on daddy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yesterday my body was just a couple of years older than you, and I was sick of just not quite being an adult. I wished for time to move a bit faster, and now here we are... Although I did just wish for time to stop.&quot; Jack finished up with the dishes, wiped his hands dry, and put the ring back on. He stared at the ring for a second and all this did start as soon as he got the ring. Maybe it was because he had his kids with the ring on that they were aware... and Maybe Jr. didn&#39;t notice what was going on because he was distracted watching his cartoons or whatever. <br />
&quot;Well can you wish for time to go back to normal, I&#39;m a little freaked out right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Time wasn&#39;t normal though, and honestly I&#39;m not comfortable with my not even a day old daughter going through puberty.&quot; Jack stated as he looked at the ring and wondered as he said &quot;I wish you were four years old.&quot; and then watched the purple gem glow a little and then looked to his daughter who seemed to shrink into her clothes. After she fully shifted her clothes had shifted into training pants, and a pink dress with a hello kitty on it. She looked like she was about to cry when Jack said &quot;Listen, you can complain all you want but if you do then I&#39;ll be forced to turn you into the newborn you actually are.&quot; <br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not a newborn I&#39;m getting close to a day old!&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a newborn&#39;s age outside of this weird reality. Also don&#39;t talk about this outside of me and Jr. I don&#39;t think anyone else is aware there is anything weird going on with time. If you are good I&#39;ll think about giving you back some age.&quot; Olivia was pouting a bit, but nodded as she understood her position... Now time for Jr.<br />
<br />
Jack explained something similar to Jr. but didn&#39;t feel the need to regress him... to the annoyance of the once Older sister. Jr. for sure was surprised by everything but handled the revelation better. The boy realizing he wouldn&#39;t have had time to have even a game of catch with his father until he was in his mid-teens without this change. Jack now had a large amount of decisions to make</p>
