<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Weird mental arguing was one way to recall of what Jeff knew he had parents, a sister and a life capable of more to do than hang limp or bloated. If ever asked about living being the male member of a stallion, Jeff would likely admit it had its fun times.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jeff, yea you boy, you are me and I am you as we are feeling pretty cocky today!” Jeff thought to himself as if a game he played every morning when his stallion host awoke and did his hearty morning pissing. The sensation of hot piss stream out of a round hole, his mouth as such, leaving on his minute penis tongue a raunchy flavor of what all the host ate the previous night.<br />
<br />
As then the horse owner would enter the barn and begin the serving of morning grain rations and a bucket refilled with clear cold water. The relative flavors of mixed raw grains and several drinks of water satisfied the stallion host and the sense of satisfaction dwindled down to where Jeff held onto his place in life.<br />
<br />
Hanging as limp felt was a thought as almost as nice like when bloated and erect. As the man walked his stallion from the stall to the barn aisle, if Jeff was allowed to remain as hanging limp, it allowed Jeff some time for viewing of the surroundings. The living of most all his day and assuredly as all night tucked away inside an equine sheath is warm, but boring. No television, no reading a novel, no sports other than that of courting a mare. No going to a museum, a baseball game, but there was the coming Memorial Day parade Jeff overheard the own talking to his stallion, as though the dumb beast knew or cared.<br />
<br />
As about twice each week, and Jeff would try to count the mornings as giving him something more to think about than erect when pissing, or erect when masturbating, or erect when the neighbor kid came around and liked to fondle Jeff, causing the host stallion a sensual thrill. Jeff liked to be fondled, he kept his small sheath mounted eyes as closed when the kid knelt down and stroked the cock body. Jeff liked being washed after each breeding session, the warm water felt good but getting soap into eyes without any hands to rub a definite irritant, as left him blinking and feeling a hurt.<br />
<br />
“Ah the simple life,” Jeff would think back to a movie with John Wayne and a young Ronny Howard, he remembering the movie scene by scene pictured in his vivid memories. Memories were all of what kept Jeff from going insane or staying alert to any possible sensation where he might exert an urge to become again as erect.<br />
<br />
Time kept on moving, Jeff thought he had stayed two weeks being a horse cock; as knew if he lived for much longer being a male organ to a stallion animal all sense and thought process might cease.<br />
<br />
Then, one a late night as the host horse slept and snored loudly, Jeff was awake and felt human hands fingering about the outer edges to the sheath. The sensual skin related to the horse-host he had an annoying visitor. The stallion rose quickly to a standing position, ready then as capable to defend his stall, his small home.<br />
<br />
A tag-light L.E.D. lantern set by the rollback door to the box stall, it giving of fair amount of light for the neighbor kid to see what he was afer.<br />
<br />
“Come, come boy let it hang, I want to see and touch your silky skin cock, yes, yes that is what I want, let me stroke it!” The boy said and through the ears of the horse-host Jeff heard the spoken word but still did not know why he could hear at all. It was as if the horse-host mind and the mentality of what was Jeff were linked.<br />
<br />
The boy kept up his stroking to Jeff’s clean cock body. Jeff had his eyes as open and was watching and appreciating the sensual show. As then the boy took from his jacket pocket a green tube of what Jeff read the label, “Vaseline intensive care lotion, Aloe soothing gel.” The boy stopped his stroking to squeeze out as apply a big glob of the lotion to his hands and began again stroking the cool feeling substance, causing an arousing sensation to the horse and his mindful cock.<br />
<br />
“Rub a dub dub,” the boy said as his stroking of the slimy cock body began to relate the lotion to the sensation of thrusting inside a mare vagina.<br />
<br />
The cool sensation aided the stallion-host to relish the feeling happening to his cock as he stood stretched with his body long as he could in the confines of his stall. Jeff was with the boy and both of the same mindset, each wishing to bring on such an arousal as to force the stallion to ejaculate.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the urge as building, his big scrotum seemingly swelling, preparing to spew a load. Jeff then could not imagine what he saw in the dim light and dark shadows, as the boy lifted the distal end to the horse cock toward his mouth. The sensation of the cock glans to the wet licked lips of the boyish mouth was all the stallion-host needed to feel.<br />
<br />
A boiling gush of pre-cum mixed with silky creamy semen shot out the round mouth hole to the cock body. The boy’s cheeks puffed out as his mouth filled from the overflow. Jeff saw the boy near to choke as he down swallowed the first jetted load, as then three more followed waves of ejaculate bloated the young cheeks, as the boy swallowed with each new spew. As the climax came to an end the boy held the cock in his mouth and began sucking on it like anyone might of a straw suck down in a thick milkshake.<br />
<br />
The sucking sensation worked to erupting of a thing flow, it mostly pre-cum and some minor pearl-globs of un-spent semen trailing out the open end to his cock self. As if the boy was sex crazy he began a second round of sensual cock stroking, as he reached to bring the bright lantern to set beside him; it lighting the horse stifle as never before that Jeff could recall.<br />
<br />
“Holy horse dubers, what is this,” the boy said as he raised his hands high onto the sheath skin and thought to finger at the blinking black skin eyelids of Jeff’s small eyes.<br />
<br />
“Eyes, two eyes, and they are blue eyes, what are you, is this a severe birth defect?” The boy said as Jeff wanted to reply but words out his distal end piss-hole mouth were for him then as an impossible ability. Instead, Jeff was capable to give his cock body a snake-like wiggle, and as the boy held onto the cock he felt the thing contort in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Are you alive,” the boy asked, and Jeff again gave his body a stouter wiggle.<br />
<br />
The boy brought the blazing lantern a bit closer and asked a question, “If you are alive, and a separate mentality but not of the stallion above, blink your eyes three times very fast.”<br />
<br />
“Blink-blink-blink,” Jeff blinked his black skin eyelids.<br />
<br />
“Were you born as a cock, ah a penis, if yes blink twice, if no blink three times,” the boy asked and Jeff liking the fun attention, blinked then twice, as to reply with an answer of “No!”<br />
<br />
“Did you become a cock through the use of magic,” the boy asked and this time the eyes blinked three times.<br />
<br />
“Did you become as you are now due to science experimentation,” the boy asked as Jeff blinked again three times to give a negative answer. To this the boy looked as stymied, not knowing of what else to ask.<br />
<br />
“If I only had with me my laptop computer,” said the boy as then Jeff blinked twice his eyes.<br />
<br />
“By computer, a computer program caused you to become like this,” the boy asked as acted with a renewed sense of glee. As he laughed after Jeff blinked his eyes twice to signify a yes answer. <br />
<br />
“Naw, I know of a fake program, a friend bought a copy, as needed to specify he was of legal age, like me, as I just turned eighteen but don&#39;t look all that mature; yet his copy did not work! <br />
<br />
Did your copy work to make of you as a horse cock, now that would be quite an erotic wish to try,” the boy said as he then let out a horse semen burp. &quot;Yuck, I need to research the program, and maybe learn of who you were and if your program was saved or deleted!&quot;</p>
