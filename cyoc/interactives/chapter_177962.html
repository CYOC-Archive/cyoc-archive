<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Laila embrace each other in a newfound passion the likes of which neither of you have never felt before. It was as if both of you were kissing for the first time. Suddenly you feel Laila’s hands caress your back, finding their way under your shirt. Each touch sends waves of pleasure down your entire body, you feel your nipples harden and an unfamiliar wetness in your crotch. You feels as though this wetness is begging for her touch, but for now your too shy to say it. You begin to caress Laila’s inner thigh. As your hands move up and down her silky smooth legs, she trembles every so slightly. You get lost in her exploring her body, loving the sensation of her exploring yours, and hoping the moment never ends.<br />
 <br />
Suddenly Laila breaks away from you. You stare at her doe-eyed and disappointed. She seems flustered and quickly stands up.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never done anything like this before, I’m sorry. I’ll be going now, I’m glad you’re okay. Goodbye.”<br />
<br />
She bolts out the door before you can say anything to her. You feel disappointed, more so than you ever have before. You’re also still turned on. You decide to return to your computer. You skim the story you had been reading, it seems that one of the women you were reading about made a second wish, something about history or memories. You don’t really read it, you aren’t in a mood to concentrate Confused and aroused, you spend a minute reviewing your day. You read a story, turned into a woman-no turned into a lesbian woman, and had the most amazing make out session of your life. This was a lot to process, so instinct tells you to take a relaxing bath. So you run some hot water, and drop in a bath bomb that you found in your new bathroom.<br />
<br />
As you lie back in the warm water you let your mind clear, and things begin to come to you. Memories, of the life you’ve lived. You remembered your name was Keiko Carter, and you’ve been studying to be a teacher. Your parents were Lucy and Mariko Carter. Your Mother had met your Mom while on a business trip to Japan, and the two quickly fell in love. You’d grown up in the California, and had two younger sisters, Christy and Tomoko.. You’d always felt pressured to be the good sister so you had a bit of a dull childhood. It all seemed so clear to you now. Yet there was one thing you couldn’t seem to remember, your love life was a blur. You remembered having a crush on a girl named Angelica in 6th grade, and nothing after that. You felt like a virgin though, something about Laila’s sudden departure was a familiar sting.<br />
<br />
“22 and a virgin Keiko, you need to just get out more.”<br />
	<br />
You sank beneath the water holding your breath. This was all so confusing, it was is if you were the same person but a new person. You started to try and think back to school. It seemed as though much of what you remembered before was still true. History was still a mess of heroines and villains, but it seemed the world was a little more just. People were fairer so that was good. You try to think, but it’s hard when your thoughts keep drifting back to Laila. She was so beautiful, you’d had a crush on her since  you moved in but were always too shy to say much to her. You couldn&#39;t exactly think of a good reason why that was. Cultural differences hadn’t stopped Mom and Mama had they? Were you just too timid? You feel frustrated and come up for air.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I should ask Tomo for advice, she’s a natural ladykiller.”<br />
<br />
You lay back and let your hand find its way to your vulva. This is new, and yet depressingly familiar. You explore your folds and run your clit, Goddess it’s an intense feeling this time. It must be because you were so aroused. You insert a finger into yourself, and picture Laila. It’s intoxicating and you lose all sense of place and time.<br />
	<br />
Your really starting to enjoy yourself when suddenly there’s a knock on the door. You hurriedly grab your robe and walk to the door.<br />
<br />
“Keiko? Can we talk?.”<br />
<br />
You panic just a little, and try to think of an excuse.<br />
	<br />
“Uh...can it wait until tomorrow?” You say, mentally kicking yourself for your timidity.<br />
<br />
“I’d really like to talk to you right now” Laila replies emphatically,<br />
<br />
You hastily tighten your robe and open the door letting Laila in. As she enters you notice she’s wearing a long coat. You ask her to take a seat in your living room and excuse yourself to your bedroom for just a moment. Once in your room you hurriedly look through your wardrobe for something sexy to wear. Part of you thinks of all this as new and foreign, but an every growing part of you seems to be taking control. You intuitively now know the rules of women’s fashion. No time to coordinate an outfit, best stick with the robe. You choose your sexiest bra and panty set, the one you’d been saving if you ever met anyone. Now is as good a time as ever. You look yourself once over in the mirror and drape your robe just down low enough over your breasts to be alluring.<br />
<br />
“Alright Keiko, just put on your best face and go out there. Worst she can say is now.” You say psyching yourself up.<br />
	<br />
You open the door and Laila sits on the couch comfortably, sipping a glass of water she helped herself to. You sit next to her trying desperately to hide how you want nothing more than to kiss her again.<br />
<br />
“So what did you need?” You ask trying to sound sexy.<br />
	<br />
“I wanted to apologize to you. Something about you felt new and a little scary to me, and I just left after we well you know...made out. I really don’t know why I flipped, most 25 year old girls would love to make out with a woman like you. Whatever it was I’m over it now.”<br />
<br />
You decide to tread carefully “It’s okay, but I gotta ask, am I that bad?”<br />
<br />
Laila shoots up, looking mortified. “Goddess no, you’re amazing. In fact that’s kinda why I had to come over to see you. I’ll be honest when I got home, I just couldn’t stop thinking of you Keiko. I took a shower to calm down, but I just couldn’t get you out my head. I think we could be something”<br />
<br />
As she speaks you notice her leering down your chest, and when she’s standing your head is just over her belly button. You leer down at her crotch area, trying your best to remain composed in spite of yourself. You glance back up to see Laila drop her coat. She reveals herself to be wearing a gorgeous dress draped across her, accenting all her curves in just the right way.<br />
<br />
“I was hoping we could pick up where we left off, I even got all dressed up for the part.”<br />
<br />
You stare at her wide eyed, and just nod. She leans in for a kiss and you feel her lips on yourself. She pulls you off the couch and you break off to catch your breath.<br />
<br />
“Laila Jaber, would you accompany me back to my bed?”<br />
<br />
“Keiko Carter, I’d love to.”<br />
<br />
You lead Laila into your room, the clothes you wore earlier still thrown on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I had to take a bath to calm down too. I’ve had a crush on you for a long time.”<br />
<br />
“Well I don’t know why I never thought to try anything to until now, but I’m glad I’m here. Now take off that robe.” Laila said as she shed her dress. She was wearing gorgeous black panties and no bra at all.<br />
<br />
You take off your robe revealing your best set, not that Laila’s doesn’t put yours to shame. Not that it matters seeing her breasts for the first time you feel mesmerized. You have to touch them. You reach over and gently cup them, they’re soft. Her glistening brown skin almost shines and her little brown nipples are about the cutest things you’ve ever seen. All you can think of sucking on them for a short while, but she pushes you down before you can start. Flat on your back you see her climb over you, and she pushes herself into you locking lips. She’s fairly aggressive in bed, but it’s working for you. You start kissing her back only to feel a slight jolt run up your spine, her hand finds its way under your panties and to your clit. She playful explores your folds sending waves all over your body with every touch, after a moment she raises her fingers now wet to her mouth. She sensually sucks your juices off of them, the sight drives you made. You find yourself unable to recall a time you’ve had sex like this, but there are a few things you’ve been wanting to try.<br />
<br />
“Let me suck on your nipples, it’s something I’ve always wanted to do to you.”<br />
<br />
“Well darling, nipple play doesn’t do much for, but if you insist. I may enjoy watching you do it.”<br />
<br />
Laila gets up and crawls over your bed, leaning back against your headboard. “Well come sit on my lap honey, I’ll only bite if you want me to.” <br />
<br />
She slides down your bed, and you crawl on top of her. As you do she removes your panties, leaving your womanhood exposed to her. You arch your back and grab her breast taking it into your mouth. You tease her nipples with your tongue as your gently nibble on it being careful not to use your teeth. Your a little caught of guard when Laila uses her arms to hold you on one side, and gently finger you on the other. She gently pulses her fingers in and out of your wetness, and your in turn use the rhythm to play with her breasts.<br />
<br />
“Oh Goddess! This is doing more for me than I thought it would.” She looks down at you lovingly then bends towards you to whisper in your ear “Keiko honey, call me Mommy.”<br />
<br />
You have no idea why, but that gets you going even harder. You play on her breasts with all the furvor your body can muster. Time melts away and you pleasure her for what feels like hours. Every pleasurable moan Laila makes is a personal victory for you, and every moan you make one for her. Until Laila can take it no longer. <br />
<br />
“Let me taste you Keiko.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Mommy.”<br />
<br />
You change positions and Laila lowers herself between your legs. Her hot breath your womanhood drives you mad in anticipation until finally she gives your lower lips a deep passionate kiss. Laila aggressively eats your pussy, bringing you to orgasm over and over. You scream in pleasure, and caress her head lovingly with your hands. Lost in passion you thrash about as the orgasms send shocks through your entire body, arching your back, flooding your mind and curling your toes. Yet Laila does not wave her tongue explores your folds, and slips inside you. She writes a poem of love on your clit, and soon enough she stands back up.<br />
<br />
“Are you on Birth Control?” She asks.<br />
<br />
“No I’m not. We’re not tribbing tonight Laila.” She seems disappointed, but you dropping the ‘Mommy’ title lets her know you were serious. She takes a slight breath and returns to her more perky self. “Then it’s your turn to return the favor.<br />
<br />
She makes you finally take her now drenched panties off. The sight of her womanhood is more than you can bare, but she tells you to lie back. She lowers herself onto you sitting on your face, the smell is intoxicating. You’re much clumsier than she is when it comes to cunnilingus than she is. Still you’re a quick study and after a short while you have Laila writhing in pleasure on top of you. She orgasms on top of you over and over and again, and you take each one as a point of pride. Even as her juices begin to cover your mouth you can’t think of anywhere you’d rather be. This is heaven to you now. Somewhere deep down inside of you and little voice that feels out of place begins to disappear. You’re more confident in who you are now. You’re Keiko Carter, and you’re finally getting into the pants of Laila Jaber. You couldn’t feel any happier.<br />
<br />
The hours that follow are a whirlwind of positions, orgasms, and the cries of pleasure. After sometime you lie in Laila’s strong arms just talking to her. <br />
<br />
“Laila, why did you freak out on me earlier? I’m not mad, I just want to know if you’re okay?”<br />
<br />
“It’s silly, but it felt weird at first. Like I’d never kissed a girl before. I don’t know why, I was a regular Ginerva Casanova in college. I guess I just realized you were different, you’re someone I’m serious about right now.”<br />
<br />
The two of you talk into the wee hours of the morning about everything. You learn that one of Laila’s mothers was really from India and that her other mother was from Syria. She’d grown up in Syria, but had left to come to study fashion in the US and stayed there. She’d actually designed the dress she’d come in wearing and her panties. She tells you of her girlhood and her family, and you do the same. She laughs when you tell her stories of your sisters being brats. You tell her that you and Tomo have Japanese names and Christy has an American one because your Mama carried you two and gave you names from her culture, and your Mom carried Christy and did the same. As you begin to drift off into slumber Laila promises to take you to breakfast in the morning, a proper date. You cling hard to your new girlfriend and drift off to sleep with one comforting thought: Keiko Jaber has a nice ring to it.</p>
