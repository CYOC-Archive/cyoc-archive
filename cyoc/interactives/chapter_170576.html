<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> After about half an hour of travel with Alec carrying Vivian and Neke while flying, and Cecelia, who was carrying Andrea, although in a less flattering way since Andrea was still inside the sleeping bag, using her &quot;air walk&quot; skill, had reached the nearest Adventurer&#39;s Guild&#39;s field HQ. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you said that you grew wings because your &quot;Succubus&#39;s Love&quot; skill leveled up, but did you also get stronger too?&quot; Asked Vivian while still in Alec&#39;s arms. <br />
&quot;Not too much I think, but maybe? I haven&#39;t checked my stats in a while.&quot; Alec replies while setting down Vivian onto her feet. Cecelia just dropped Andrea like a sack of potatoes though. Clearly she was upset by something. &quot;Owww, did you have to just drop me like that? I said I was sorry okay.&quot; Whines Andrea as she crawled out of the bag rubbing her butt. <br />
&quot;That great that you said you are sorry, but I specifically told you to contact me if any change in plans were to happen. That was a week ago. And while I am out investing an unknown demon, what do I find? My sister, who has been missing for a week, complaining about how sleepy she is because she was TOO BUSY FUCKING SAID DEMON TO EVEN REPORT HOME!&quot; Shouted Cecelia. <br />
&quot;I can explain. I got caught by a witch and turned into a slug/human hybrid while I was out last week. These girls saved me, and a bunch if others, So I offered to help them out with things, and..<br />
 well... um...&quot; Andrea trailed off, and looked over to Alec, hoping she would understand and clear things up from there.<br />
&quot;And what?&quot; Asked Cecelia, in a now much calmer tone. If Andrea was being held captive by a witch, it made sense why she never checked in. And if that other girl&#39;s 6 boobs were also related, then that was more than enough proof to back up her story. <br />
&quot;Well, I can&#39;t really say, because I don&#39;t really know. Alec knows better about what happened afterwards, so you should ask her.&quot; Clarified Andrea after Alec completely dropped the ball on helping her with a follow up explanation. <br />
&quot;I see, well.. are you safe now? Are you still hurt anywhere from the witch? Did you escape without being noticed by the witch?&quot;<br />
&quot;The witch is dead. Those 2 killed it somehow.&quot;<br />
&quot;You two, are you certain it is dead? Were you able to confirm it?&quot;<br />
&quot;The witch is 100% confirmed dead&quot; stated Vivian. We killed her and not only was her magic ubdone, but the swamp where she changed into a meadow for her hut is returning.&quot; <br />
&quot;That Excellent news then. Thank you both for saving my sister.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your welcome, although she just happened to be there at the time. So it isn&#39;t like we went specifically for her sake. Also, word of this will likely arive soon too from the main guild HQ, as there were numerous victims freed as well.&quot; Alec further explained. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep an ear open. Now then, the reason why you are here. Alec, you are an unregistered Succubus, yet somehow have a guild card issued to you. Can you explain this?&quot; Questioned Cecelia. &quot;Shit, thats right! I had completely forgot about that. Sorry Alec.&quot; Vivian said appologeticly. Alec looked at her confused. What did she forget? Vivian then reminded her that she was asked a question. &quot;Right, well, its complicated, and somewhat personal.&quot; <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t care, spill it.&quot; Cecelia said harshly. &quot;It is my job to protect the people of this town and uphold public order, I could care less about the personal infornation surrounding your reason, but I need to know how you slipped through our system.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alec explained everything over the next hour. How she was originally a man, has a possession skill, lost his dick, met Vivian, helped to kill a witch, and finally get turned into a Succubus by a magic ability. Cecelia&#39;s face got more and more exhausted looking as the story went on. Once it was finally over, she simply sank deep into her chair. &quot;Do you have any idea how complicated your existence alone is for me?&quot; Not only can you possess anyone, but you also can kill them and no one will be able to tell you exactly how they died. That is why all Succubi are required to be registered. You can kill and leave absolutely no trace behind. Plus your innate charming skills makes any trading done with you a guarenteed loss for the other side unless done at a specific location. Guards will handle you differently, everything has to be done differently with Succubi. But you also can possess someone. That makes everything we have set in place automatically obsolete on top of that. Huuuuhhhhh fuck.  Okay, here is the deal. Andrea, you are now permanently assigned to Alec as her escort. You will handle all material and logistical sales for her and will become a core member of her party. You are responsible for her got it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, I guess. I mean, that was the plan all along anyways.&quot; <br />
&quot;Right, of course it was, i&#39;m sure. Do you understand that Alec? This is for your sake as well, so if anything isn&#39;t clear, speak up.&quot; <br />
&quot;I understand.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright then, you mentioned a name change. We can handle that here for you if you would like.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, if that isn&#39;t a problem.&quot;<br />
Vivian looks at Alec, shocked &quot;You are changing your name! Let me pick it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Not a chance, knowing you, I would be called Titties or Succubust&quot; retorted Alec &quot;No, please just change my furst name to Alice if you could.&quot; Alec, now Alice, said as she hands Cecelia her guild ID. <br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Says Cecelia. She picks up Alice&#39;s guild ID card, and with a pen-like object, scratches off her old first name, scribbles ALICE on top of it, and hands it through a slot in the wall.<br />
&quot;That will just take a few minutes. Now then, I have 1 final question for the 3 of you. What exactly is your relationship with each other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends with benefits for now&quot; says Andrea.<br />
&quot;Best friends with benefits and partner with Vivian and I guess now FWB with Andrea too&quot; says Alice.<br />
&quot;FWB with Andrea and Alice&#39;s lesbian girlfriend&quot; casually declairs Vivian. Which causes everyone to look at her. &quot;Wait, are we not like that already Alice?&quot;  <br />
&quot;I mean we never officially said anything or even had a serious conversation about it, but I&#39;m totally on board with it if you are.&quot; Vivian nods and Alice quickly remidies her statment now declairing herself as Vivian&#39;s bisexual girlfriend.&quot;</p>
