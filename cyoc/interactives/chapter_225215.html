<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle placed his hand against his chin, making his garganttuan knockers wobble about. How could he possible undo all this damage? How could a curse, an inanimate concept, know who would be a right owner of a particular body? &quot;Maybe the wording needs to be a bit more vague, or abstract, to get the results I want. Owner of a body doesn&#39;t even make sense, so maybe I have to change how I look?&quot; He said, hearing his mature female voice talk made him shiver a bit.<br />
<br />
Standing up, he nearly bumped his head on the ceiling fan. &quot;That&#39;d take some getting used to.&quot; He thought. Shaking his head, he struggled to put on any clothes, thanks to Jen&#39;s curse already making all clothes he&#39;d own or buy be a size smaller already. Sighing, he just wrapped the cover from his bed around his amazonian milf body. <br />
<br />
Waiting for his mom to come home felt like it took forever. Using the bathroom or maneuvering through the house he was a little too big for were very strange experiences.<br />
<br />
Once she arrived through the front door, he practically ran into her. Being an absolute giant, or more accurately giantess, Kyle loomed over her rather intimidatingly. Having to peer past his bombalicious bosom, Kyle felt depressed at seeing her smiling head atop his old body. He hoped this last chance would do the trick. Any further and the damage could be completely horrendous. Yes, this just might be the last time he tries fixing this with the curse. &#39;Third time&#39;s the charm, right?&#39; He tried reassuring himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright mom, transform or dare?&quot; He straight up asked her. She smiled sweetly, finding her son&#39;s jokes adorable. Though she does kinda remember something about a silly town curse, albeit not for a long time. &quot;Dare, I guess, sweety.&quot; She replied.<br />
<br />
This gave Kyle some relief, he didn&#39;t want to transform her any further, aside from being back to normal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. I dare you to use the curse on me, which I will pick transform. The transformation will be one that fixes the appearance of my body, making it so that I appear how I always did, physically,  visually and literally, regardless of what the curse considers to be proper ownership of what.&quot; He explained. His mother chuckled and nodded, reciprocating the curse back to him. He figured that instead of referring to thsir bodies explicitly, the curse will put him back to normal, since how he always looked and dressed was as a normal young guy in appropriate guy clothes. If successful, he can do the same to his mom.<br />
<br />
However, like everything else today, this also didn&#39;t go according to plan. Kyle didn&#39;t account for the fact that history, past, present and future. How someone always looked or dressed will be interpreted completely differently.<br />
<br />
For Kyle&#39;s mom, she always used to dress in extremely skimpy, tight and sexy clothes. She staryed in her school years and persisted up until shortly before Kyle was born. She stooped for the sake of a modest, motherly appearance, yet always yearned to show herself off to the world again. This history trait, applied to her body, was brought along over to Kyle with the swap. So, the history of Kyle&#39;s motherly body meant the appearance would be put back to one of being sexy and skimpily dressed. A hyper voluptuous, amazonian milf body was sexy enough, so the only thing that canged was Kyle received his mothers mouth and lips. The thicker lips and whiter teeth were definitely sexier. No changes happened to his body other than that. However, his wardrobe took the biggest hit this time.<br />
<br />
Any reasonable modest clothes and footwear he received from his mom wereball changed into sexy as heck outfits. Outfits that emphasized showing tons more skin, emphasized his voluminous and curvy assets, yet were still tighter since Jen&#39;s curse made them smaller. No outfit completely covered parts of his body now. Even his shoes were nkw all slutty. Close toed shoes like flats, sneakers or boots were xompletely gone. Replaced with open toed shoe versions of heels, platforms , and sexy sandals galore. And with that, it was done. Kyle&#39;s efforts were all for naught. He pouted, which looked cute with his mother&#39;s lips. Sulking off to his room, his mom said she&#39;ll go make dinner.<br />
<br />
Very quickly, Kyle learned his new wardrobe, berating himself for ruining his life more. Trying to find the most covering outfit he could, he now stood idle. Tall and voluptuous for days, his massive milkers were squished into a pink tube top. But the swollen sweater puppies spilled out of all sides, so the top really only served to cover the nipples. A g string he wore dug inti his lower moist lips, making it look like he was actually commando. The shorts he had on still made his lower ass cheeks and thick thighs visible to all. The shoes were practically all the same in terms of lack of modesty, so he had on some black flip flops that showed off his dainty polished toes and soft milf soles with every step he took. &quot;Effing fantastic.&quot; He cursed, trying to pull the clothes to cover even just a bit more. &quot;I&#39;m a guy with the body of an amazonian bimbo milf now!&quot; He worried about going out in public like this, expecting people to act no differently of course, but the shame would eat him alive. &quot;What am I to do now?!&quot; He worried.</p>
