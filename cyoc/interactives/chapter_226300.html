<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thousands of miles away, Jennifer was unhooking herself from her milking machine. She’d emptied her breasts and balls, knowing that she’d have a few hours before she needed to again. <br />
<br />
Candi was passed out on the steel table, her face red, her cock and nipples still hard. Eleanor, Zoe, and Cynthia had all jizzed inside of her, leaving the bimbo ecstatic. After Candi passed out, Eleanor put a milking machine on her, and Candi was having a pleasant wet dream.<br />
<br />
Jennifer walked out, her lingerie and lab coat on, and approached the three scientists who were now working.<br />
<br />
“That little slut is satisfied now, hm?” Jennifer said, motioning to Candi.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think she’ll ever be. But she seemed to have a good time. I know I did.” Zoe said.<br />
<br />
“She wrote some ideas inside of a journal and they’re really great. The pages are kinda sticky, though.” Cynthia said.<br />
<br />
“We’ve already put one in motion. I folded the page over so you could read it, Jen.” Eleanor said.<br />
<br />
Jennifer strutted over and opened the notebook. It was a garish pink; the cover was a glittery neon pink with text reading “Equine Studies.” The pages were a light pink, contrasted by the writing, which was cursive in a sparkling dark pink ink. Jennifer noted the hearts in place of dots for I’s and that every word was neat and properly spelled. Finally, Jennifer reached the folded page. She quickly read it, her cock hardening and a wicked smile forming on her face. “Oh, this is good.” Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
“I’ve got it on the crystal ball if you wanna watch.” Eleanor said with a grin. Jennifer’s face lit up.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked into the crystal ball with excitement…<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kayla Jensen had returned home from a long day at work. As the youngest (and first female) mayor in Glendale’s history, she had big shoes to fill. At 30 years old, she’d focused entirely on her career, grit her teeth, fought tooth and nail to get to the position she was in. There was no time for friends, let alone boyfriends. Was she lonely? Sure, but she was successful, and she told herself that was enough. And she knew she was - her pale skin was clear, her blonde hair was neat, if a bit thin, and her body was perfectly average - a nice, healthy weight, a normal pair of breasts, an average pair of hips. Her face was completely normal, her green eyes an average size, her lips thin but healthy looking, her nose - completely average.  She was… perfectly average.<br />
<br />
As the mayor of Glendale, she’d encountered some… unique issues. Many of her residents were very upset at Mareville, a community that was completely surrounded by the town and had been a part of it at some point, though Kayla couldn’t quite remember when, and her mind got fuzzy when she tried to. Many residents of Glendale felt that Mareville was a cult, and rumors had quickly spread about disappearances and odd rituals, despite no tangible proof.<br />
<br />
Kayla had run on a strict anti-equine stance, though she’d inadvertently helped the equines by arguing for the separation between the two towns. Though no equines had showed up, the two communities had signed an agreement to build the gate and enforce the security measures between the two areas, enabling Mareville to operate with its own laws. Kayla found it rude that not a single equine had shown up in-person, though part of her was secretly relieved - humans and equines did not get along. <br />
<br />
Kayla didn’t much care for the perverts herself. In fact, Mareville was one of only a few communities that legally allowed prostitution. Kayla winced thinking about it. She couldn’t believe those harlots. Nymphomaniacs that had no shame. She was glad they stayed far, far away from her.<br />
<br />
Putting these thoughts aside, she looked at a package she’d found at her front door.<br />
<br />
“That’s odd, I don’t remember ordering anything.” She said to herself, opening the package.<br />
<br />
Instantly, a mist filled the room. Kayla was sprayed in the face with… something. Her mind raced. Poison? A political opponent… no, some radical… however, Kayla quickly realized that it wasn’t poison. It was… the best smelling thing she’d ever had the pleasure of inhaling.<br />
<br />
Kayla had no clue that Candi’s idea was going exactly to plan. Cynthia, Eleanor, and Zoe had carefully crafted the device and, along with Jennifer, were eagerly watching on Eleanor’s crystal ball.<br />
<br />
Notes of cinnamon… chocolate… roses… and some sort of wonderful musk. The scent emanated throughout her home, the cloud of equine musk covering every inch of her house. Kayla felt HOT. She needed her clothes off, now! She ripped off her shoes, her pantsuit, her stockings - right down to her underwear. And she was still too hot! Ripping off her underwear, she moaned as her rock hard nipples brushed against the fabric. <br />
<br />
As the smell continued to permeate throughout the house, Kayla realized that she was hot in a different way. Her pussy gushed liked a geyser as she lamented how empty it was. Sticking a finger in, she shuddered with pleasure. She kept inhaling the wonderful musk, feeling more and more pleasured as time went on. As she masturbated, her mind began to twist and change - and reality did too. <br />
<br />
Her mind filled with horse herms. She reasoned with herself - it was just their cocks, right? Bigger than humans. She didn’t like girls anyway, right? However, more and more thoughts about their perfect, feminine bodies filled her brain. Their giant tits. Their massive asses. Their sexy pussies. She was scared at first, but the more she masturbated, the more familiar it felt. <br />
<br />
She soon remembered not being an anti-equine activist, but a closeted equine lover. Like a homophobic gay politician with a secret boyfriend, Kayla lied to the public, worshipping and cumming to the thought of equines in private. <br />
<br />
Reality changed more and more, and Kayla’s obsession grew. Now, she secretly funneled city funds to Mareville, a form of atonement for the anti-equine policy she unwittingly peddled. Kayla moaned more and more as her lust deepened. She now remembered masturbating often, even at work, to the thought of equines. She didn’t dare look up their porn, she was too afraid of being caught. It was so perverse to her - she wanted their giant cocks to stretch her pussy and asshole so that she could never find pleasure in a human cock again. She wanted to suckle on their giant tits, to submit completely to the horse herms. Humans were inferior in every way, after all.<br />
<br />
Kayla was so confused. She felt like she couldn’t cum, like she was so close but the dam wouldn’t burst. And then she remembered - she’d never had an orgasm. She’d always wanted to, always felt like she was close to one, but she was cursed to edge herself, make herself more obsessed with the thought of horse herms. She knew if she met one, a herm could make her cum. She was so close to sneaking into Mareville, so close to eloping with the first horse herm who’d have her and disappearing forever…<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jennifer was in awe as Mareville became far more luxurious. She looked outside the window - it was far more European in nature, with brick paved roads, luxurious cafes, higher end looking stores, and a town square. Jennifer looked at the middle of the town square and found a fountain with a bronze statue of herself - fully nude, her cock erect. Jizzmilk was coming out of the statue’s cock, its pussy, and its breasts. Jennifer spotted Caroline’s Cafe; instead of the regular coffee shop it had been, Jennifer noted that there was a granite exterior and a large, expensive gold looking sign. Overall, the city felt more like a fancy shopping district than the homely American Main Street it had been. <br />
<br />
Jennifer remembered that a mysterious benefactor had been sending large donations to Mareville since its inception - she realized that it was Kayla.<br />
<br />
“Oh, this is wonderful!” Zoe said, looking around the lab. It now had far more equipment and, again, was just far more expensive looking.<br />
<br />
“The plan was a success!” Eleanor said with a giddy jump.<br />
<br />
“Oh, this is just amazing! Candi’s going to make such a good addition to the team. And maybe Kayla will, too.” Cynthia said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Yes, that’s certainly true.” Jennifer said, her cock hardening in excitement.</p>
