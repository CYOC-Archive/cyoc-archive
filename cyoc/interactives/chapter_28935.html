<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>After a good long while, Jasmine stood
up. "I'm...I've..." She fumbled for words,
trying to express her gratitude without
letting anything slip that she might
regret. "Thank you," she finally said. "I
really needed that."</p>
<p>"Anytime," Ryan smiled. "I hope
everything works out for you."</p>
<p>Jasmine smiled back. "I'm hoping so. I
need to go discuss some things with my
mom, though. I guess I'll see you
Monday."</p>
<p>"See you then, then," Ryan said.
Jasmine walked off. Ryan sat by the pool.
<i>My God,</i> he thought. <i>I can't
believe this. I'm attracted to a girl who
used to be a guy. Even if she got that way
magically, it's just...man.</i> He sighed.
<i>I mean, I can't look down on her for
it; it wasn't her fault. But...what would
other people think? What about Mom and
Dad? What would I tell them, "hey, Mom and
Dad, I'm going to be dating this girl who
used to be a guy friend of mine?" I mean,
they're pretty open-minded, but I think
even they'd draw the line at my dating
someone who's technically transsexual.
</i>Very<i> technically,</i> he mused.
<i>You'd never even guess by looking at
her...god, she's pretty. But anybody who
knew would think...wait, why am I caring
what other people would think? I
guess...Mom and Dad I'd worry about;
they're my parents, after all, and we have
a lot better relationship than a lot of
guys my age do with their parents. I'd
hate to lose that. But...everyone else?
Why do I care what they think? That,</i>
he decided, <i>doesn't matter. But...the
big question is whether Jasmine would go
for it. I know she likes me as a friend,
but she just turned into a girl yesterday.
She said she wasn't a lesbian, but that
doesn't mean she's ready to date guys
yet...or maybe ever.</i></p>
<p>That was a sobering thought; his good
friend, the object of his affections,
might be unattainable; if she didn't like
girls, but didn't like guys either, that
meant...Ryan had never understood how
people could consider themselves asexual,
but he supposed that in Jasmine's case, at
least, it could make some kind of sense.
<i>I guess if that's the case,</i> he
thought, <i>I'd have to give up on her. If
she felt that way, there's no way she'd
ever want to be more than friends - and if
I pushed the issue that'd hurt our
friendship. Even if she was open to the
idea,</i> he thought, <i>what if she did
find a way to change back? Would our
relationship outweigh her desire to be a
guy again?</i></p>
<p><i>It would be worth it,</i> Ryan
decided. <i>If we had any kind of real
love in the relationship, she wouldn't
want to change back. And don't they say
that it's better to have loved and lost
than never to have loved at all? I just
need to find out whether she likes guys or
not. Maybe...at school Monday I could brng
it up. Tactfully. And if she does...I'll
have to wait for a good time, and then
I'll ask her out.</i> He got up and began
to walk home. Maybe it would work out and
maybe it wouldn't, but he'd at least
try.</p>
<p>Jasmine, meantime, had returned to the
food court and pulled her mom aside.
"Listen, Mom," she said. "I know you're
excited about having a daughter. And I
guess I can understand that, since you've
been the only woman in the house for your
entire marriage. I know you think this is
pretty cool, but right now I really can't
handle someone being so gleeful about
this. I was really traumatized yesterday,
and this morning, too, and it only made it
worse to have you trying to play
dress-up." Her mother's face fell. She
sighed. "No. No, I didn't mean that the
way it sounded; I'm sorry. But this really
is a problem."</p>
<p>"Jasmine, dear," her mother said, "I
only want to help you. I just don't want
you to miss out on an opportunity like
this. If you just reject this out of hand,
you might not find out if you actually
like being a girl. I'm sorry if you felt I
was just trying to dress you up; you're
right, I went a little crazy after having
a son but no daughter for sixteen years. I
won't make you act girly if you don't want
to. But I do want you to experiment, to
see what you are and aren't comfortable
with. I'm not expecting you to like being
a girl, and I'll do my part in finding you
a way to change back, if that's what you
really want, but I don't want you to miss
out on potential happiness. I can tell you
from experience that being a woman is a
wonderful, rewarding thing, and given time
you might see it that way, too. On the
other hand, it might not, but I at least
want you to try and find out, okay?"</p>
<p>Jasmine nodded. "At present, it doesn't
look like I'll have a way to change back
for a long time, if ever. And I'm very
sure I want to be a guy again." This was
only sort of true; she <i>was</i> pretty
sure of it, but there'd been a nagging
doubt at the back of her mind ever since
her conversation with Ryan. "But I had a
talk with a friend from school, and that
made me realize that it's not going to do
any good to mope about it. And...since you
agreed to not make me act or dress girly,
I guess what I can do in the way of
compromise is to agree to give it a fair
shot. I'm not promising anything, but I'll
try to take it as it is and not let my
desire to be a guy again color my
perception of what being a girl is like.
And if and when we do find a way to change
back, I'll weigh the options as fairly as
I can and then make my decision. All
right?"</p>
<p>"All right." Her mother smiled. They
embraced. <i>I don't </i>think<i> I want
to be a girl,</i> Jasmine thought, still
remembering how it felt when she was
crying on Ryan's shoulder, <i>but...either
way, I'm glad to have my family and
friends here to help me through
this.</i></p></p>
