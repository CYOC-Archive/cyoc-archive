<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Firing a Breast Missile off at a rather stubborn door left a big creepy hole in your chest as a robo-gal, but switching back to just the Charge Boobs, you had two again. You were a bit disappointed when you found another door in need of a missile it didn&#39;t come back on its own. No real point staying like that until you found more ammo. Pressing forward, you came across a gap in the floor. It was a tricky jump, but you were entirely confident in your athletic prowess. With a running start, you took a blind leap, nearly clearing the gap and landing on your feet, but instead falling just short enough to absolutely mash those Charge Boobs into the cold hard floor. That hurt quite a bit, and overcharged your gun, blasting you back off into the pit before you could climb to safety. It was a darn long fall, but you&#39;d had worse. Granted you also hadn&#39;t landed on the big pair of breasts that caused you to fall in the first place, mashing that already rather sore newly exposed flesh yet again. Ow.  You didn&#39;t see a good way back up, and the only real path forward lead straight into a sauna. Maybe a natural hot spring. Either way, their was hot steamy water, lots of rocks, and your suit&#39;s visor really fogged up. Past that was a sort of airlock or reinforced bulkhead or something, so you braced yourself for some sort of hidden docking bay full of powerful ships or something but... no. It was the world&#39;s smallest aquarium. Weird. Actually as you looked around more carefully, it was more like this little airlock was the tank and that was just the ocean on the other side of the glass. Damn, you hoped whatever construction crew rigged all this up collected a serious check for it. They must have had to come down in a sub hauling this reinforced pipe, must have been murder getting a seal... actually they probably really cut some corners, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t have been paranoid enough to put it behind airlocks.<br />
<br />
And that little architectural wonder just lead to an elevator. One with so much heat radiating out of the shaft you&#39;d swear it lead straight to hell. You really didn&#39;t want to run around sweating your balls off if you could avoid it at all, so you combed the walls for any other possible path. Or really, you turned yourself into a snake girl again and embarassed yourself lying eggs around all the major seems hoping that rattling would shake out a loose panel or something. Sure enough, the back wall by the elevator rang hollow, and a bit of feeling around revealed a secret door. That would be a fun one to brag about in your report after all this. You&#39;d just... leave out the dozens of weird kinky ovulation/extreme vibration orgasms you had to give yourself before you found it. On the other side there was a real rickety staircase leading to a door halfway up the wall flanked by gaudy nude statues. Yeah, someone with more money than sense was hiding out down here, clearly. Since you were still in snake form, you carefully slithered up the stairs. They really didn&#39;t look like they could support your weight if you didn&#39;t distribute it.<br />
<br />
Inside was a private bar. Didn&#39;t seem to be open at the moment which suited you just fine. You swiped a pricy looking bottle off the shelf because frankly you really needed it, curled up in a booth with it, and well... all the egg laying it had taken to find the place had you pretty worked up so you might have maybe started feeling up those massive jugs with your free hand and triggered that breast snake combo accidentally. The explosion trashed the bar pretty bad but on the upside it knocked the front panel off an air conditioning vent and gave you a new path to explore without getting anyone&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
Eventually you dropped into a hall full of tacky paintings, and finally dropped the snake form. Damn thing was almost addictive. Advancing slowly, you suddenly got jumped by someone you&#39;d sworn you killed a good decade back. But there he was, right in front of you, Kevin &quot;Raid&quot; O&#39;Connel. One of the slimiest space gangsters you&#39;d ever met. Without even thinking you grew that big ol&#39; lizard head, belched a flaming rock his way, and he went down like a house of cards. Well, that was easy. Wait, that was too easy. Suddenly you remembered this jerk had a thing for cloning himself and using them as decoys. Which... also explained why killing him the last time didn&#39;t stick.<br />
<br />
Checking out the rest of the place, you found a safe full of munitions, letting you replace those robo-boobs, and another hidden door to wear the real Raid was hiding. No reason to talk about how many eggs that took. You could quit any time. Anyway the real Raid was sitting in a hot tub eating takeout. Guy&#39;d really let himself go compared to his clones. Normally you wouldn&#39;t comment on somebody&#39;s weight, but seriously, how the hell did he even get himself in here? This guy was way too tubby to manage that sketchy staircase. He put up a bit of a fight of course. Guy had a rocket launcher next to his hot tub among other things, but you were a damn professional here. Plus he wasn&#39;t wearing armor, so your rockets did a hell of a lot more to him than his dead to you. Cleaning up the mess, you found his key card for accessing more of the base, and hey, another vending machine!<br />
<br />
As much as you hated using these capsules, at least you had the option. These space gangsters must just get so mad when they find these and can&#39;t do anything with them. Anyway, you slotted in your prize, and suddenly your whole suit froze up on you. This... didn&#39;t tend to happen. Big huge text appeared on the inside of your visor - SOFTWEAR UPGRADE INSTALLING. Everything just had to have firmware updates didn&#39;t it... and those dumb space birds made such a glaring typo here too.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, your whole suit just collapsed in on itself. It squeezed you in along with it of course, as it tended to do, and just full on turned you 100% curvy babe, which it also tended to do. Normally though, all the armor plating would fold up onto your back though or something... here it seemed like the whole suit just disappeared. Or at least... changed into some sort of skintight purple spandex leotard. You didn&#39;t even have a cool cannon on your arm! Just this little handheld blaster with some twisty ribbons running up your arm to the leotard. For a moment, you panicked. Had this damn suit finally hit you with the ultimate prank, permanently turning you into a girl and exploding? Fortunately not. Concentrating, you could still go part robot, grow a lizard head, and turn into a snake woman. Feeling yourself up still charged your gun. You&#39;d just gone from having this big tough suit of armor to... soft wear. You swore at those damn birds for the stupid pun as you made your way back out to the elevator.</p>
