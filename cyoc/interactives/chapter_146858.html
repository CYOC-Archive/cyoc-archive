<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike held his mother&#39;s panties in his hands. He was completely covered in cum, especially his hands, and Mike suddenly became concerned that getting his cum on his mother&#39;s panties may have a effect on the swap magic, so he dropped them to his side.<br />
<br />
He carefully reached over to the side of his bed and grabbed his &quot;cum rag&quot;, a rag he used to clean himself up after a typical jerk of session. He had always thought that the rag was too big for his normal loads, but he was now quite happy that it was big enough to soak up the massive load he just blew out of his giant cock.<br />
He wiped away the pools of cum resting around his perky tits and tried to get as much off his hands as possible. <br />
<br />
Mike was amazed at just how sensitive his tits were. Even rubbing them with the cum rag was pleasurable! He couldn&#39;t help but wonder how women resisted the urge to play with their breasts non stop. Was it just his sister&#39;s breasts that were so sensitive? Perhaps it was just the eroticism of the situation Mike was in? Maybe it was just a result of the body swap magic?<br />
<br />
Either way, despite the fact that Mike had cleaned up as much of the cum from his body as he could, he continued to rub his breasts with the rag just for the sheer pleasure.<br />
<br />
Mike felt the overwhelming urge the swap again. It was such a powerful feeling he actually gasped out loud. There must be some reason he was so desperate to swap. He made a mental note to ask the genie about it, but in the meantime remembered his mom&#39;s panties were sitting on the bed next to him so he grabbed them, got off the bed and walked over to his mirror.<br />
<br />
Mike took a moment to appreciate his beautiful body. His dick was soft but was still hanging low, halfway to his knees. His breasts we&#39;re a bit flushed from being handled so roughly but they were still perky and amazing.<br />
<br />
He looked at the panties he held in his hands and fantasized about swapping his muscular, bubble butt for his mom&#39;s pillowy, voluptuous ass.<br />
<br />
He turned the panties inside out and started rubbing them on his ass. He thought about his mom&#39;s wonderful butt swapping with his own. Mike felt a familiar jolt of electricity on his ass and a smile spread across his face.<br />
<br />
He dropped the panties to the floor and watched his ass in anticipation. As soon as he saw the skin of his butt start to shift, Mike had a thought. He wished as hard as he could that the transformation would last just a bit longer.<br />
<br />
He watched as his ass started to expand outwards in all directions. However, miraculously the transformation wasn&#39;t as fast as it had been for his tits and cock! As well, Mike could feel the stretching of his butt and it was a very erotic sensation.<br />
Over the course of a minute, Mike&#39;s ass expanded outwards. <br />
<br />
At first, Mike was very excited about the change but he slowly became concerned as the swap didn&#39;t seem to be working the way he expected. His mom had a huge ass, but it was a very womanly shaped ass. What Mike had sticking out from his backside looked like two flesh sized basketballs had replaced his glutes.<br />
<br />
As if responding to Mike&#39;s concerns, the growth of Mike&#39;s ass stopped and instead it appeared to start changing shape. The mass beneath the skin shifted around, slowly taking the shape of his mom&#39;s heart shaped ass like someone was rolling out a ball of dough.<br />
<br />
As well, Mike felt his hips actually start to widen. He shifted his stance to accommodate the new width of his hips. Mike was pleasantly surprised at this new change, excited that his body would change to accommodate his new posterior.<br />
The changes stopped abruptly and Mike examined the result. <br />
<br />
The first thing Mike noticed was a tattoo on his left butt cheek. Mike had never actually seen his mom&#39;s naked ass before, and she had never mentioned having a tattoo. It was just a simple blue and purple butterfly, but the most interesting thing about this tattoo was delicious feeling of being let in on a naughty secret he had never known before.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, his mom&#39;s ass was everything he expected to be. His mom was fond of wearing stretchy yoga pants, which left little.to the imagination. However, Mike was now able to fill in the gaps of his imagination. His mom&#39;s ass was smooth and blemish free. She was a very healthy and active woman, and it was very much noticeable in her butt. There were no stretch marks and no cellulite. This was easily the ass of a 24 year old, even though his mom was in her early 40&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Mike reached back with both hands and caressed his buttocks. The skin felt as smooth as he imagined it did. Luckily his ass hair had been swapped, unlike his chest hair when he initially swapped his sister&#39;s tits.<br />
<br />
Mike was surprised to discover that his mom&#39;s ass was not pillowy at all. Even better, it was firm and plump. He imagined that, when she was being fucked from behind, her ass would jiggle around hypnotically.<br />
<br />
Mike suddenly felt the urge to give himself a playful slap on the ass. It was just a light tap, but Matt was floored with the feelings that it enticed in him. As he watched his ass jiggle around from the slap, the slight sting he felt didn&#39;t really hurt but rather caused a deep feeling of erotic pleasure throughout his body. This feeling was further intensified with his tits and dick jiggling along with his new rear.<br />
<br />
Mike was thoroughly enjoying his new ass, but he wanted to do more with it. While he explored the new sensations from running his hands over his fleshy butt and running his fingers gently across his new, sensitive anus, Mike started imagining what he&#39;d like to do with his new rear end.<br />
<br />
The first thing he thought of was to put on a pair of his thermal underwear. They were very stretchy, like his mom&#39;s yoga pants, so he&#39;d finally be able to caress his mom&#39;s butt like he had fantasized about for so long. He was also really looking forward to seeing the massive bulge of his cock in the stretch pants. With such a massive rear and massive cock, he hoped that the fabric of the underwear would be stretched to the limit. They were solid black, but he was hoping they would stretch out so much that he could see the colour of his skin beneath it</p>
