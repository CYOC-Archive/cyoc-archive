<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie sighed as she walked home. She had gone from feeling excited about playing matchmaker with Mary Elise to feeling distressed about keeping Claudia and Mika’s secret. She hated keeping anything from Katie but she had made a promise. While she only had a casual relationship with the two teens she did like them. Mika and Claudia, who were two of the most popular girls in her grade, had treated her very kindly. Them being so accepting of herself and Katie definitely made things easier at school. Kellie wasn’t sure if the girls could be vindictive if she let their secret slip but she didn’t want to find out.<br />
<br />
As she walked onto her street she could see Katie and her aunt returning home. Taking a deep breath Kellie composed herself and smiled.  Claudia and Mika’s secret would be hers to keep but she could still tell Katie about Mary Elise. “Hey Katie how was shopping.”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she hugged her girlfriend. “We had fun,” she said. “How about you? Do anything interesting?” Kellie smirked as she handed Katie back the ring. “Well do you remember Sebastian Kane?” Katie paused as she tried to think of the person. “Sort of,” she said. “Isn’t he a junior? He’s kind of a science geek and I think he lives next door to Mary Elise.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled in awe as Katie’s memories slowly began to form. “Well I have some surprising news then,” she smirked. “First off he used to be a college professor that’s why you memory of him is a little fuzzy. Secondly he’s now dating Mary Elise. Matchmaker Kellie strikes again.” Katie stared in awe of Kellie, she was astounded that the ring had created memories of Sebastian But was so pleased Kellie had use the ring to help their friend Mary. <br />
<br />
“Great job Kel,” she said as she gave a girlfriend a kiss. “Sounds like you had fun. Anything else happen?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Kellie said flatly. “That was about it. Anyway mom and dad are probably starting to worry where I’m at. I’ll call you later tonight Okay.”<br />
<br />
“Okay talk soon,” Katie said as she watched her friend run towards her house. Turning she saw Aunt Lisa hading inside. “Hurry up Katie,” she called. “I need to start getting dinner ready and I want you to double check your homework. You do have school tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
The afternoon passed relatively quickly as Katie helped Lisa make dinner. The two then sat down to enjoy their meal talking about Lisa’s date and Katie’s sleepover . As Katie now helped her aunt cleanup she could see a sad smile on her aunts face. “Everything Okay Aunt Lisa.”<br />
<br />
Lisa turned towards her niece and smiled. “Yeah I’m okay,” she sighed. “It’s just I used to call your mom after my dates to tell her how things went.  She always looked out for me, wanting to know how it went. Asking if he treated me right. When I was your age I didn’t appreciate it.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded solemnly as she looked at her aunt. “Even after all these years you miss her huh,” Katie said solemnly.<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded her head as she wiped her eyes. “Yeah I do,” she murmured. “I know it’s silly, I really do. I’ve been taking care of you for nine years ever since she passed. But today, I don’t know, maybe because it’s been so long since I dated but I really miss having those talks with her.” Katie stared sadly at her aunt, wishing their was something she could say to help her. “I’m sorry aunt Lisa. I miss mom too. I never realized just how much you missed having her around.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled as she looked at her niece. “Yeah I miss her a lot. Being the kid sister is always more fun than having to be the responsible one.”<br />
<br />
Katie and Lisa began to laugh as they continued to talk. Lisa continued to reminisce about growing up with Katie’s mom. How her mom was the one that waited up for her when she went on dates or how when Lisa was feeling down as a kid her sister would braid her hair. Katie laughed long as she heard that story thinking of a young Lisa having her done up by her teenage mother.<br />
<br />
“I can not picture you having braids Aunt Lisa,” Katie laughed. Lisa smiled as she looked at her niece. “I used to love it,” she giggled. “I remember being in junior high some guy dumped me on the dance floor to go be with a different girl. I came home crying and your mom gave me a hug and put my hair in a long French braid.” Lisa sighed as she looked out the window. “You sometimes I miss that. Just being her kid sister and having my hair done. Things were so much simpler then.”<br />
<br />
Katie paused as she gazed at her aunt an idea was forming but if she did that she would have to do two things. Phrase the wish correctly and tell Lisa about the ring. Katie sighed as she slowly began to work up the courage. “Aunt Lisa,” Katie began. “What if I told you I could grant that wish.”<br />
<br />
Lisa gave her niece a bemused look and smiled. “What are you talking about kiddo.”<br />
<br />
Katie took a deep breath. She was about to do something bold and without telling Kellie. In fact if she did what she thought she was about to do, she wouldn’t tell Kellie at all. “Aunt Lisa what I’m going to tell you is a secret that stays between you and me.” Lisa sensing that her niece wanted to tell her something sat down, looking over Katie with a concerned yet loving eye. “Go ahead Katie tell me what it is I won’t judge you.”<br />
<br />
“Aunt Lisa I discovered a magical ring that allows me to change peoples age.”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled as she gave her nice a bemused look. “Okay Katie good one,” she said flatly. “A magic ring, gotcha. It’s cute you want to kind of cheer your aunt up but come on do you seriously expect me to believe this?”<br />
<br />
Katie frowned as she looked at her aunt. “I am being serious,” she stated. “I can change someone’s age. I’ve just been nervous about telling you. I didn’t know how you would react to what I was saying.”<br />
<br />
“I probably would of thought you were nuts kiddo,” Lisa smirked. “No offense, personally I think it’s cute you would even come up with this story to try and cheer me up.”<br />
<br />
Katie glared at her aunt now. Lisa wasn’t taking her seriously, she realized if she was gong to prob this to her aunt she would have to show her. “Okay Aunt Lisa,” Katie murmured. “I’ll tell you what. Why don’t you pick an age and I’ll make you that age. Deal?”<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled as she looked at her niece. Katie seemed determined to see this through. Lisa shrugged as she began to think about what Katie was saying. If she could be a kid again how old would she want to be? As she searched through her memories she thought about how when she was seven a group of girls had picked on her at the playground. The three girls were probably a little older than her and pushed her into a mud puddle ruining her clothes. Lisa’s mother brought her home where she cried and cried. It was her big sister, who was barely a teenager at that point, who made her feel better by cleaning her up and braiding her hair. Lisa smiled as she thought about that memory, it was the first time she realized what a awesome big sister she was blessed with. “Okay Katie,” she said with a smile. “How about you make me seven then.”<br />
<br />
Katie gawked at her aunt. She wanted to show her aunt the power of the ring but she had no idea she would want to make herself so young. Cursing herself quietly she took a deep breath as she carefully began to word her wish.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” she muttered. “I wish that Aunt Lisa was physically seven years old. That only myself and Lisa would be aware of the changes that took place and that everyone would remember Lisa as 35.”<br />
<br />
Katie now stared anxiously at Lisa waiting for the changes to take place. Lisa in turn smiled down at her niece. “Well I hope you got that out of your system Kat.......OH” Lisa shivered as Katie’s eyes bulged. Looking around Lisa began to look around the room. “Did you feel a draft,” Lisa asked. “That felt really weird.”<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head as she stared at her aunt. “That wasn’t a draft Aunt Lisa,” She stammered. “Your....your getting younger. Look!”<br />
<br />
Lisa smirked and sighed as she got off her chair and began to walk towards the mirror in the hallway. Oddly she found her pants seemed to be a little loose around the waist. Lisa adjusted them and continued to walk. As she reached in the mirror she gazed at her reflection and screamed. “Oh my god!”<br />
<br />
Lisa gaped at her now 25 year old reflection. She could see that the slight lines around her eyes had vanished giving her a fresh and youthful look. Lisa ran her fingers through her hair, which seemed to gleam with vibrant energy. At a loss for words she could only stare in awe. Lisa now looked as she did 10 years ago when she began her professional volleyball career. As she continued to watch her reflection she became startled. She was still growing younger.<br />
<br />
“This, this is incredible,” she gasped. “I mean look at me. I look like a college kid.” Lisa twirled as she adjusted her baggy clothing. The waistline of her pants appeared to be several sizes too large as they sagged on her. Katie watched as her aunt held her arms above her head posing in a sensual manner. The now 20 year old Lisa frowned as she looked down at her chest. The woman breasts appeared less full than before and more perky as she grew increasingly young. Taking a moment Lisa eyeballed her appearance as a look of shock spread over her face.<br />
<br />
“Katie,” the now 19 year old whispered. “It’s not stopping. I’m...I’m still getting younger!”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded as she looked at her aunt. “I know Aunt Lisa,” she said solemnly. “You said you wanted to become seven so your going to be seven.”<br />
<br />
Lisa’s jaw dropped as she took in this information. Slowly she turned to the mirror and winced at her appearance. Lisa was now a high school girl of 17. The muscle tone she had worked so hard to obtain in her twenties was slowly vanishing as she retreated towards childhood. Grasping her chest Lisa could tell she was no longer a c cup. Instead she now possessed a pair of perky b cup breasts. As Lisa looked at herself she watched as she became 16. <br />
<br />
“Katie,” Lisa said before wincing. “Oh my god, my voice. I sound like a teenagers!”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded. “I know Aunt Lisa I think we’re the same age,” she paused she looked closer at her aunt. “Well, we were the same age I think you might be younger than me now.”<br />
<br />
Shocked at her voice and what Katie was saying Lisa turned back towards the mirror. Her eyes bulged as she saw her 14 year old self in front of her. Lisa’s breasts and curves were rapidly decreasing as she appeared coltish in appearance. As Lisa watched she could see herself begin to shrink as she relived a growth spurt in reverse. Lisa looked down at her young hands and watched as the sleeves slowly began to slide down onto her hands. Before she could say anything though she felt her jeans begin to slide and quickly grabbed for them. The girl in the mirror now was a young 13 year old girl barely entering puberty.<br />
<br />
Lisa turned towards Katie to say something and stopped. Lisa had always been a couple of inches taller than her niece and enjoyed being a woman with an above average height of 5’9”. Now she found herself at least four inches shorter than her niece, having to crane her neck upwards to look at her. Lisa was about to say something when she felt herself shrink again. The 12 year old girl looked down at her body and gasped. Her once proud breasts had been reduced to a pair of softball sized mounds while her curves were barely flared. The muscle she was so proud of wiped away leaving a small and childish body.<br />
<br />
“You okay Aunt Lisa?” Katie asked as she looked at her 11 year old aunt. Lisa nodded quietly she she turned back towards the mirror. In a moment Lisa shrank becoming 10. Her shirt now hung on her frame covering her hand to her fingers. Lisa stared at her hand while holding up her increasingly heavy jeans. Lisa now looked down at her pants. The legs were far too long for her legs now and as she wiggles her toes she could see her shoes were several sizes too big. Sighing the young girl easily kicked off her shoes exposing socks that also seemed several sizes too large.<br />
<br />
“This is so weird,” 9 year old Lisa exclaimed. “And oh my god I sound like a chipmunk right now.” Katie smiled as she looked down at her childish aunt. “Well your adorable if that helps,” she giggled. Lisa frowned and looked up at Katie. “Not helping Katie,” she grumbled.<br />
<br />
Katie couldn’t help but smirk as Lisa became 8. The formerly adult woman seemed to be almost melting in her clothes as she got younger. The formerly fitting blouse she had worn ballooned around her now completely covering her hands while her jeans puddles around her feet covering her sock covered feet. As Lisa’s regression completed and she became seven Katie could see Lisa’s shoulder begin to pop out from the head of her blouse. The girl was adorable now with a childish face and long flowing auburn hair. Katie couldn’t help but smile as Lisa looked at her childish appearance.<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she looked up at her now much taller niece. “Okay Katie you made your point,” she said. “You made your point I believe you. Can you make me a grown up again now?”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she knelt down next to her aunt. “I will soon,” she said. “But first, I think you could use some braids in your hair.”<br />
<br />
Lisa grinned as she realized what Katie had done. For the first time in more than nine years Lisa was going to get the opportunity to be the little sister again.</p>
