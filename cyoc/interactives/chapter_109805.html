<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly Tricia could feel the changes starting to take hold. Knowing what was in store was little comfort to what she was about to experience. Tricia had gotten a rush from seeing her freind in need earlier and being the only one who could help her. Now she was in for a bit of role reversal...<br />
<br />
The tingling began where the beam hit her square in the chest and radiated outward. Her breasts began to swell, all four of them quickly breezing by the D range, and then DD. Four more points of pressure formed beneath them as her newest breasts began to take form. Her nipples split and grew outwards until all 8 of her breasts sported 4 dark teats that hung out over her fur. She closed her eyes as she felt them begin to stiffen and grow erect, partially from the cool air blowing over them, and partially from the milk she could feel come surging in! She had been planning on Sam enjoying this change, but she didn&#39;t know it would start feeling this good!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile her hands had devolved further like her feet, soon becoming no more than just another pair of crimson hooves. She could feel her hips changing next. Tricia stood and braced herself on the counter as her hips buckled and adopted a more extreme angle with her back. She held out as long as she could, reluctant to give up her defining human trait, but Tricia&#39;s hooves soon slipped off the slick granite and she came crashing down to the ground.<br />
<br />
As she struggled to pull heself back up, she realised he wasn&#39;t able to get any further up than her hands and knees! Well... her hooves and... er... hooves. Looking behind her Trish realized she was now on all fours like any real cow would be. Her legs looked almost exactly like a real cow&#39;s, but proportioned to fit the sze of an 18 year old girl.<br />
<br />
Tricia had felt a bit awkward programming this next change, but she had thought it for the best given the new circumstances. Trish grunted as she felt her pussy shift from its home between her legs, to just below her asshole, just like a real cow&#39;s. At least her ass still looked human, outside of being stuck in a digitigrade stance. Her arms had also changed in the meantime, her biceps remaining mostly the same but her elbows becoming knobly joints connecting to much more bovine fore-hooves.<br />
<br />
By now her breasts had swollen to their final base size of EE&#39;s, but the milk filling them was making them swell even further. Why had she set the lactation rate so damn high?! She had just loved the feel of milking Sam so muh at the time, but things felt very different with the shoe on the other hoof. Tricia tried spalying her forelegs as much as possible as her huge breasts fought for room hanging from her torso. The teats were all now several inches long and at least an inch thick, dribbling creamy liquid all over the floor.<br />
<br />
Given the diminishing available real estate on her body, Trish grimaced as she felt the next change begin to set in. The familiar pressure returned, this time coming from between her legs where her vagina had once been moments ago. A fleshy lump began to push out from her groin, topped with four more bumps. The lump was soon easily identifiable as a quasi-udder, and then a full fledged milk-sac topped with teats nerly twice as large as all her others! Her udder grew unil it came down past her bovine hocks, and was swelling out so much it was forcing her legs uncomfortably far apart. Soon her hind legs were splayed just as far apart as her front, and the udder was still pressing for space around them!<br />
<br />
She could feel the first wave of changes dialing down as her body began to settle into nits new configuration. Tricia tried moving around the kitchen a bit, not able to manage much more than a waddle in her current state with her hooves clopping softly on the linoleum floor. Her breasts and udder swayed heavily with every motion, and she had to step carefully to avoid sqashing her engorged teats that were now brushing the floor.<br />
<br />
She tried her best to look over her body, but didn&#39;t have much succes, her neck still limiting her head&#39;s lateral movement, and her massive breasts blocking the view between her legs. As if on cue, she could feel her neck begin to lengthen and thicken slightly. Soon her neck was big enough to alow movement similar to a cow, but remained mostly human in appearance. Now able to look over her her shoulder, she was able to see her udder for the first time. She had been able to start feeling it brush against the floor so she was worried what she might find!<br />
<br />
Trish lifted a hind leg as best she could and was able to make out the giant pink mass. It was enormous! And the teats were as least a couple inches thick and several inches long... And it was still growing! She had been waddling on her hoof-tips before, but when she tried to put her leg back down to steady herself, she missed entirely! Her ass plopped down behind her directly onto the pink and black mass like an oversized bean bag chair, squirting streams of milk out of the teats as her legs struggled to touch the ground! She could feel her legs rising further in the air as her udder continues its growth, pushing her breasts forward in their fight for space. By the time the swelling finally subsided her hooves were easily 6 inches in the air and her front pair of milk jugs were pushed proudly out between her fore-legs!<br />
<br />
Trish could feel the changes winding down once more. That was all she had programmed in right? She tried to think back, but the pressure of all her udders just ACHING to be milked was making concentration extremely dificult! They all felt so awkward and full... and delicious! She would need to empty them all over again before she could change herself back, but the thought of it sent involuntary shivers excitement through her swollen body!<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when a tickle in her throat reminded her of the final change... It had been a last second addition she had thrown in there to make things a bit more fun, but nw it was going to really put her in a bind!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam!&quot; she cried out, panicking that she might get stuck like this permanently! She had to tell Sam about the remote before it was too late!!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sammm! Sammmmmy! Sammmmmmoo! Smmmmooo!! Mmmooo! Mmmmoooo!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmmmmmoooooooooooooooooooo!!!&quot;</p>
