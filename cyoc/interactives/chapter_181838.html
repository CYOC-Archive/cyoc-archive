<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, across town, Seth was having a rather erotic dream. In the dream, he was working out at the school gym with another guy. The guy was toned, but not nearly as muscular or hairy as Seth was. He had short brown hair; a handsome, chiseled face, and piercing blue eyes. Seth couldn&#39;t help but think he was familiar, even though he couldn&#39;t place his finger on it. The guy met his gaze and smiled, dimples appearing in his cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You all right, Bro?&quot; the guy asked in a deep voice, stopping his workout. It suddenly clicked in Seth&#39;s mind who this guy was. It was Max! Looking at him closer, he could see some resemblance to the Max he knew, but this Max was way bigger, and WAY hotter!<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you need,&quot; Max said, pulling off his shirt as he walked over to Seth. &quot;You need some quality time...&quot; Max grabbed Seth and brought him in to a kiss. Seth reciprocated, opening his mouth for the impromptu make-out session. The dream shifted and they were now in a bed in a garage, both completely naked and making out. Max leaned forward and took Seth&#39;s jockhood into his mouth. Seth moaned appreciatively, his hard-on growing while his boyfriend caressed it with his tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Max...&quot; Seth moaned. &quot;I can&#39;t hold back anymore!!&quot; Suddenly, Seth awoke to an incredible orgasm. The room he was in was dark, barely lit by the closed window blinds. For a second he could still feel Max&#39;s mouth around his dick, but the intensity of the orgasm was too much for him to think coherently. As he relaxed in post-orgasmic bliss, he heard snickering coming from nearby.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, Bro! Don&#39;t even bother hiding it. You were moaning like a cheap hooker!&quot; A voice said from nearby. <br />
<br />
Seth shook the cobwebs out of his head. His sleepiness paired with his morning orgasm made thinking difficult. &quot;Huh?&quot; was all he managed to get out.<br />
<br />
A light appeared from a bedside table, and Seth looked across to see Brian in his bed, a smirk across his face. &quot;Sounds to me you were having a pretty intense dream,&quot; Brian said, stretching his muscular arms and revealing his bushy pits. &quot;Dreaming about that boyfriend of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seth paused for a moment. Even though he had just orgasmed, the thought of Max seemed to fuel his libido. But his mind paused at the thought of Max. Part of him vaguely remembered a nerdy kid that couldn’t stand Seth and whom he was forced to do projects with during their British literature class. An even foggier memory made him think about him bonding with Max over nerdy interests and their dislike of PE, but those thoughts were quickly fading away like the dream he just had.<br />
<br />
Instead, he distinctly remembered meeting Max when they were kids. Inviting Max to play football with his brother and their friends. Them growing up together, becoming more than friends. He remembered his and Max’s first kiss when they were 12, and the first time they had jacked each other off at 14. He even remembered having sex with him at 15. It was all there, distinct and vibrant in his mind. He and Max were bonded. Was it just a memory from a dream? Could it be true? His dick hardened at the thought of having, in his opinion, the sexiest boy in the entire school as his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
“Earth to Seth!” Brian called out to him. Seth looked up from his thoughts to see his older brother standing next to him in a tented jockstrap. “Are you there?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, sorry Bro!” Seth said, throwing off his covers to reveal that not only did he apparently sleep naked, but his stomach hair and crotch were covered in sticky cum. He got up and was assaulted by a powerful smell of body odor coming from both him and his brother. “I call dibs on the shower first!” he said, running into the bathroom that was next to their bedroom. Part of him wondered why his friend whom he went to school with was his brother, but that was quickly put out of his head when he realized that Brian had always been his older brother. Seth started up the shower and quickly started washing his body, daydreaming of Max the whole time.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Brian was shaking his head at his dumb brother. Wait, that wasn’t right. Seth was his son, not his brother. But that was impossible. Brian was 18, and Seth was 16. They had shared a room together for as long as Brian could remember. But he also had vague memories of being older. Not the 18 year old stud that he was, but in his 40’s, having graduated college and coaching the high school football team. No, that was something his dad did…Or was it? The football coach was Coach Chase, who most certainly wasn’t his father. His mind was struggling to place who his father was or what he did. He shook his head and looked around the room.<br />
<br />
The room was filled with his and Seth’s sports equipment, as well as trophies on the walls for football, basketball, baseball…He walked over to one of the dressers on the wall near his bed. Instinctively, he knew that these were his things. He opened the drawers and recognized his clothes. The clothes of an 18 year old teenager, not a 45 year old man. This seemed right. This was who he was supposed to be. He and his brother were both on the high school football team. They were best friends and hung out together. <br />
<br />
Without thinking he grabbed some clean clothes and went into the bathroom. Seth had finished his shower and was drying off. “Hey Bry!” Seth said. “Can we pick up Max on the way to school so he won’t have to ride the bus?”<br />
<br />
“I guess,” Brian replied. “As long as the two of you aren’t sucking face the whole way to school.” Seth moved to jokingly punch him but Brian maneuvered out of the way and put his younger brother in a headlock. <br />
<br />
“God, Bry!” Seth said, struggling to get free. “Your pits reek! I just took a shower!”<br />
<br />
“Whatever, Bro!” Brian said with a laugh, releasing his brother. “You know you totally have a stink fetish. I’m surprised you’re not jacking off to my smell right now!”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you!” Seth replied, rolling his eyes as he hung up his towel and walked naked back into their room to get dressed.<br />
<br />
After a quick shower, Brian got dressed and met Seth downstairs. They grabbed their backpacks and sports bags, gave their mom a kiss goodbye, and got into Brian’s car, heading down the road towards Max’s house. <br />
<br />
“So, does Max’s mom know that you two are dating?” Brian asked his brother as they drove.<br />
<br />
“No,” Seth said, looking out the window. “She and Max haven’t been on the best of terms lately. I think if she were to realize her son was gay she would throw him out on the street. It’s bad enough she’s forced him to live in the garage.”<br />
<br />
“Man, what a bitch!” Brian said as he turned a corner.<br />
<br />
“It’s hell for him, Bry. His dad left when he was just a kid, and now his mom doesn’t want to have anything to do with him. And poor Max feels like it’s all his fault. Which it’s not!”<br />
<br />
They pulled up to Max’s house and Brian parked in front of the driveway. Seth got out of the door and knocked on the garage door, but there was no response. He listened by the door and didn’t hear the shower or anything. That’s odd, Seth thought. Usually he’s ready by now. Seth looked over to the front door. He really had no desire to actually talk with Max’s mom, but at the same time, he was definitely concerned about his boyfriend.<br />
<br />
He rang the doorbell and then stood back, away from the front step. A few moments later, Max’s mom opened the door. She was wearing a breathing mask over her face and rubber gloves on her hand. She furrowed her brow when she saw Seth. “May I help you?”<br />
<br />
“Ummm….I was just looking for Max. My bro and I were gonna give him a ride to school this morning and…”<br />
<br />
“Look, I don’t care where that little shit is,” Mrs. Warner replied. “He’s in so much trouble right now…But since you’ll see him, be sure to give him this.” She disappeared for a moment and returned holding the Jock Jacket like it was poison. She tossed the jacket down on the ground. Seth picked it up. “Tell that ass if I find anything else of his in my house, it’s going in the dumpster.” She closed the door without waiting for a response.<br />
<br />
Seth ran back to his brother’s car, cradling the jacket in his arms. “We need to find Max!” he told Brian. &quot;I don’t think he’s here, and I’m worried about him. His mom seemed really pissed, which is strange so early in the morning.”<br />
<br />
As they drove towards school, Seth saw a figure standing on the sidewalk. He instantly recognized the same sexy hunk from his dream the night before. No doubt about it. Max was a sexy jock, and he was sporting a pretty strong boner on the sidewalk. “Pull over, Bry!” Seth cried out.<br />
<br />
Brian pulled over to the side of the road, and Seth jumped out of the car. He ran up to his boyfriend, who looked like a deer in the headlights. “Max!!” he said, giving his boyfriend a hug and shielding his boyfriend’s boner from any possible casual passerbys. <br />
<br />
Max’s eyes glazed over for a moment and then focused on Seth. Without thinking he returned the hug, and instinctively kissed Seth on the lips. “Seth! I’ve changed! Something’s gone wrong!”<br />
<br />
Seth looked deeply into his boyfriend’s bright blue eyes. “You look the same to me. Hot and sexy as always!” <br />
<br />
Max shook his head. &quot;This isn&#39;t right! I mean, it is right. But I&#39;m not supposed to look like this. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening! What’s going on?” he asked Seth.<br />
<br />
Before Seth could reply, Brian honked the horn from his car. “Come on, guys! We’ve got to get to school or we’re going to be late!” This snapped both Seth and Max to attention.<br />
<br />
The two boys clambered into the backseat of Brian’s car. Seth had a feeling that Max would want to continue their conversation, but they also both knew that they needed to get to school as well.</p>
