<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ah, yes. You must be Mark! Glad you could make it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very pleased to meet you , Sir,&quot; Mark said, extending his hand to the portly, middle aged man. The interviewer was also the owner and head manager of the factory and warehouse that was one of their town&#39;s best jobs if you could get it. Mark lived in a fairly small Midwest town and he wanted this job badly to save up money for college. He was dedicated to spending at least a year here, and it was the best possible place for a young man just starting off in the world. The man introduced himself as Ted. Ted was in his early 40s, had a definite beer gut, but a handsome, serious face. He had Italian Anglo roots, and wore a short goatee. He had short, thinning black hair that had receded quite a bit to take off half the hair on his head, and hadn&#39;t begun to gray yet. He would probably be bald in a few years. His build was a formerly muscular frame gone to fat and Mark could smell the man&#39;s B.O. as soon as he sat down. Ted had a bearish frame, for sure.<br />
<br />
Mark could not be more his opposite. He was cherbic in appearance, with curly brown hair that was due for a haircut. He was 17 but his face looked more like 12 or 13. He had reached a height of 6&#39;2&quot; and stood five inches above Ted when the manager had stood to shake hands with him. Mark wasn&#39;t highly muscled but he had done well with putting some muscle on his ectomorph frame. He was taut and strong, and could bench press 100 pounds quite easily. <br />
<br />
The interview went well. Mark was on the swim team, debate team, he had a good GPA. He had a semester left of high school and he would be 18 in a few months. The job in the warehouse part of the factory would require he start with loading and learning inventory, and eventually it was encouraged for him to drive a forklift. Preferably within the first four months. Mark readily agreed and said he would endeavor to learn to use one as soon as he could. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you can teach me, I&#39;m there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mark, I assume you need to get some extra cash before you go off to college, is that correct?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir. Absolutely. I&#39;m taking the first fall semester to save money so I&#39;ll be here through up until after winter break. I applied to start in spring semester.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be able to get into a dorm room?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they actually said it was possible. They&#39;ll find me something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. I remember my dorm days. God, it was great. I was so fit,&quot; Ted said, glancing with a knowing smile at Mark, innocently smiling back. &quot;I don&#39;t mind telling you it was difficult to do anything with all the sex I was getting. You&#39;re gonna have a blast. Yeoman University is a GREAT party school.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...what I&#39;ve heard,&quot; Mark grinned. This didn&#39;t feel like a very professional interview, but he was glad for it. Mark seemed to be warming up to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much money do you think you&#39;ll need?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m not paying rent to my parents. They say I don&#39;t have to, but I&#39;ll help pay the utilities if I can. I guess things are going to be pretty tight even with the extra cash. I&#39;ll be getting grants and a partial scholarship but even then, it&#39;s going to be tight. I&#39;ll work whatever job I can when I get there.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I take it Mom and Dad can&#39;t help?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;They want to, but they can&#39;t right now. That&#39;s why I qualify for grants. The scholarships were really competitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I told you that you could sit pretty. For the rest of college. Not have to worry about a thing, financially.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say what&#39;s the catch?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How would you like to swap heads with me for a year?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;A...a year?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. You see, you know that for a guy like me, the only way I&#39;m going to get someone to willingly swap heads with me is going to want legal paperwork done. No one wants to get a body like mine except for certain guys who are really into it as a fetish. But very few willingly trade for keeps. I tried to find a few online but unfortunately all the ones that are willing to trade with me are older, horny gay dudes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mark said uncomfortably. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s life. I&#39;m not that fat. My fat rolls aren&#39;t that bad. I&#39;m 270 lbs. That&#39;s not quite obese. But it&#39;s not great, either. So I&#39;ve looked into it. The average rate for a year swap with a young man your age is 50K. I&#39;m willing to offer you 30K and an assistant management position after three months. We get you that license as soon as possible so it looks at least partially legit. There will be grumbling but everyone knows I&#39;m the boss and what I say goes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s gonna be a significant pay raise. Managers here start at $28/hr. That&#39;s no chump change. If you&#39;re with me for the seven months after high school you can start at that rate as soon as you graduate. I don&#39;t need to tell you that adds up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So. Here&#39;s the deal. I get a 20K reduction on the swap and you get a cush job and you&#39;re going to be promoted over guys that have been here for years who will totally suspect why you got promoted and hate your guts for it. And that looks good down the road if you have a management position with a company like mine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good!&quot; Mark replied. &quot;I can live with that. Guys have hated me all my life for being smarter than them. Believe me when I say it&#39;s not fun being the smartest one in the room. And I&#39;m willing to tell people that. I don&#39;t care about their experience. I learn fast. I&#39;m graduating top of my class. I&#39;m in the top three at least and I&#39;m in the running for valedictorian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you experimented yet? Most kids your age have head swapped a little bit.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark grimaced. &quot;Only with a few guys a few times. We used to drink beer and play poker and one night we swapped. I swapped bods with Greg and he was fat and I didn&#39;t really like it very much. His brother swapped our heads. We stayed like that for a month. Then I got more drunk the next time. I was 16 at the time and I could handle my beer way less than I can now, and traded with his 13 year old brother. He wanted to see what it was like to be taller for a while because he&#39;s only 13 and his dad never swaps heads with him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, most dads don&#39;t. There are a few that like it,&quot; Ted replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it&#39;s crazy. I hated having a 13 year old body again. I regretted it so much His little brother begged me to jerk off in my body so I waited for him to do his business in the bathroom before he came back. It was gross. He couldn&#39;t even wait until I was gone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you had a fat body before.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and I really didn&#39;t like it. Greg was about 230, which is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;40 pounds lighter than me. I&#39;m 270,&quot; Ted told him. Mark winced. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;ve seen guys walking around with big smiles on their faces in their kids bodies. We&#39;re talking eight, ten, twelve-year old bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve seen those, too. It&#39;s always weird to me,&quot; Mark admitted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Some of them think it&#39;s funny,&quot; Ted continued. &quot;Using a booster seat while driving. Like midgets. And then there was this one guy I used to know. He traded heads with his son and he was powerfully built. Like, bodybuilder frame. His kid was being really bullied really badly and there aren&#39;t any other schools around. He couldn&#39;t afford to move so he just traded heads with his kid. And you know, you can&#39;t swap back for at least a month. Since he didn&#39;t want to give his son a month of hell and back, he just let his son keep his body for years until his dad grew tall enough with his son&#39;s body for him to be safe. And he really worked the hell out of that body. His son was working out in junior high with a huge grown up body. It was really something.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. Yeah, I&#39;ve gone to school with a few guys that traded bodies with their dads. But only for like a month or so. No one did it full time. There were more than a few guys who had old dude bodies for cash, though. But you can&#39;t spend it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until you&#39;re 16, which is why most younger people don&#39;t do it. They might do it for shits and giggles with a man with a relatively okay body in their family or inner circle of their family&#39;s friends. The older the body, the less likely you are to see it on a young person unless a trust is involved, or future college scholarship.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I should have done it earlier. I could have been a premium body. Those go for what, 70K?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;100K for me if I want a 13 year old body or if I want a bodybuilder under 30.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have the genetics. If that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not. I think my husband would be very reluctant to have me around as a bodybuilder. He&#39;s not into that. He&#39;s the strongman of our family. He wants someone either fatter or much younger. So we thought we&#39;d try something new.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. So you&#39;re gay. And that would mean I might be gay.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;When you swap heads with someone of a different sexuality, you normally turn bi. I&#39;ve done it before. i get horny for my husband but also hot chicks. The combination of brain and brawn combine. So yeah, you&#39;re gonna find dudes hot but also chicks hot. You&#39;ll go both ways in terms of attraction. But hey, I wouldn&#39;t tell you what to do and you wouldn&#39;t tell me what to do.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ll be using my body to...get fucked up the ass. I&#39;d need um...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll use protection every time. It&#39;s in the contract. Any kind of VD would lead to you being able to sue the hell out of me. In addition to this, I have to disclose that I am a habitual cigar smoker. I have cigars normally 3 to 5 times a week.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark looked at the contract. <br />
<br />
&quot;So whaddya say? Mr. Future Manager. You wanna give this time to think about?&quot; Ted asked, leaning back in his chair. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;ve decided. I&#39;ll sign.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent! I&#39;m very pleased to hear you say that,&quot; Ted said, signalling for an assistant of his to enter. &quot;This is Gordon. He&#39;ll be assisting us with the swap and he&#39;s going to legally oversee the signing of the contract. He is a licensed attorney.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark shook hands with the lawyer, who had a friendly older face, in his 60s, but with a huge frame that didn&#39;t seem to match his lined face. Underneath the man&#39;s 60 year old grandfatherly smile was the body of a star athlete. His muscles rippled against the fabric of his dress shirt and his tie looped over the mound of his pecs, falling off the shelf of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much did that set you back?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I pay about $120K a year for this body and I have to take very good care of it. I&#39;ve won three bodybuilding championships so far. Luckily, I own my own firm and I can afford it. So, just sign here. And here. And here. Good. And here. And here. And initial here. And you&#39;re all ready to swap.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Man, how am I gonna explain this to my family?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tell them you&#39;re getting a sweet job where you get to boss people around for more money than they make and you get 30K on top of that for just one year of the use of your body. They&#39;ll love you for it. Trust me. This will look GREAT on your resume. Imagine if outside of college you get a management position right away. That&#39;s what you want, believe me.&quot; Ted straightened his tie. &quot;Oh, and we&#39;ll also trade clothes if that&#39;s okay with you. I&#39;d love to wear what you wear. If I could come by tomorrow and pick those up, I can drop off a lot of my business attire and everyday casual clothes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. That...that would be cool.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Gordon began, flexing his enormous biceps as if by habit, &quot;This contract is legally binding for one year. The 30K will be deposited into your account tomorrow morning.&quot; <br />
<br />
Finally it came time. They both unscrewed their heads and Gordon gently placed the new heads on their new bodies. There was a dizzying flight through the air and then a KATHUNK! sound. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh. Ohhhh. Oh, this is nice!&quot; Ted was wiggling his newer, younger hands and fingers. He had shed a hundred pounds all at once. He went to the back of the room and started doing jumping jacks and laughing hysterically. He jumped up in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man! I haven&#39;t been able to do this in forever! Man, wait til my husband sees this! He&#39;s going to flip out. We&#39;ve dreamed of this!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark wiggled his now, much heavier arm. His body itched. He now hair hair everywhere! His old body was hairless. He had kept himself shaved down below and had no almost no hair on even his arms or legs. Now it poured out of his chest and clung against his new work shirt, which strained over the girth of his new flabs of gut. He touched his belly, and marvelled at how it jiggled. He shook it and it rippled. He tried it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so weird,&quot; he said. He now had a 17 year old head, which looked to be practically 13, cherubic looks, curly brown hair, adorable smile, with the body of a 42 year old, 270 pound Italian hairy bear! <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, kid. I have to tell you I haven&#39;t felt his good in forever. How about I take you out for a beer to celebrate!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Yeah, that&#39;s cool,&quot; Mark said, unnerved. He was now only 5&#39;9&quot;. He now looked up at his new boss&#39; head, perched on his old 6&#39;2&quot; body! <br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, kid. No one is gonna card you if you have that body from now on. It&#39;s the law. They don&#39;t go by head age, always body age. You can legally drink now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You have this now,&quot; Gordon said, giving him a card. &quot;It says you are the legal recipient of a body that is of legal age to drink.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Technically I&#39;m not old enough to drink now, but no one cards you for your body, just your face. God, I feel great!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark lumbered behind his new boss and struggled to keep up behind his new spry legs. Ted was overjoyed and started running down the hallway to get to the parking lot, laughing like a madman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Wait! I can&#39;t run very fast any more!&quot; Mark said, huffing and puffing and having to stop several times. &quot;Jesus, this body is horrible!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it... hell, if you feel like it, maybe you can lose the weight for me! I&#39;d really appreciate it!&quot; Ted grinned and winked at him. &quot;Kid, you are the best thing that ever happened to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark felt his stomach grumble. <br />
<br />
What have I gotten myself into? he thought, walking outside with a body that was now 25 years older than the one he walked in with.</p>
