<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s heart raced as he hit the submit button on the Chronivac&#39;s interface. He had always been horny for muscle and size, spending countless hours browsing bodybuilding forums and watching videos of men with bodies that defied logic. But he had never imagined that he could become one of them. <br />
<br />
As the machine whirred to life, Jeff felt a strange sensation coursing through his body. It was as if every cell in his being was expanding, growing larger and more powerful with each passing second. His muscles bulging and rippling beneath the surface, elongating and thickening until they were almost twice their original size. <br />
<br />
As Jeff looked down at his massive form, he knew that there was no stopping him now. He was becoming a true giant, a force to be reckoned with in a world that was increasingly small and insignificant in comparison to his own immense power. The growth seemed to consume him, his body expanding in all directions, his muscles swelling and bulging, surpassing the size of even the most dedicated bodybuilders.<br />
<br />
His pecs ballooned outward, resembling two massive slabs of granite with deep crevices separating each striated muscle fiber. Thick veins snaked their way across his chest, pulsating with the increased blood flow from his hyper-developed cardiovascular system. Tufts of thick chest hair sprouted around his pecs and spread across his rippling abdomen, marking the full maturation of his body.<br />
<br />
His shoulders broadened to an astonishing width, stretching the fabric of his shirt to its limits. Each deltoid muscle protruded like mountains, capable of shouldering the weight of the world. His biceps and triceps expanded, forming meaty masses of muscle that screamed power and dominance.<br />
<br />
As Jeff&#39;s waist thickened and his hips broadened, his legs underwent a mind-boggling growth spurt of their own. His powerful thighs, once slender, now swelled to become pillars of raw strength, muscles vying for space and bursting with incredible density as they destroyed his pants. His calves grew tight and defined, resembling perfectly sculpted diamonds. His body continued swelling to 7 feet and 600 pounds of muscle.<br />
<br />
Even his face was transformed. His jawline sharpened, chiseled features now framed by a full beard that grew in with astonishing speed. His brows became more pronounced, lending an air of rugged intensity to his intense gaze.<br />
<br />
Through it all, Jeff experienced the wild surges of testosterone. His voice deepened, resonating with a rich timbre that commanded attention. Every aspect of his being screamed masculinity, an overwhelming display of raw power and virility.<br />
His briefs bulges and strained against the awesome might and weight of his colossal meat. His cock swelled to full 18 inches of rigidity and tore free from the pathetic elastic confines, spewing a torrent of cum over his hulking form. The churning hairy orbs swinging low from the beastly manhood fed the deluge, even as they pumped his body with even more superhuman levels of testosterone.<br />
<br />
As Jeff&#39;s transformation continued, it began to have an unexpected impact on his brother Chris. When Jeff altered himself, he had forgotten to unselect his brother, and was forcing him through an even more intense transformation. Chris and Dominic were currently engaged in a passionate sexual encounter. At first, there was no noticeable change, but as Dominic continued to pound Chris&#39; ass with his massive thirteen-inch dick, something strange began to happen.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39; body began to grow and expand, his muscles bulging and rippling beneath the surface of his skin. His chest hair thickened and darkened, spreading across his torso in a dense mat of fur. His ass muscles swelled and rounded as Dominic&#39;s powerful thrusts sent waves of pleasure through his body.<br />
<br />
Dominic couldn&#39;t help but notice the changes in Chris&#39; body as he continued to fuck him hard. His little emo friend was growing right before his eyes, becoming more and more massive with each passing moment. Chris&#39; muscles swelled and bulged, surpassing even the size bodybuilders dream of in roid induced wet dreams. His pecs jutted outward, resembling two monstrous boulders with deep crevices separating each striated muscle fiber. <br />
As Dominic continued to fuck Chris, his dick felt like a toothpick in comparison to Chris&#39; massive muscles. The hulking stud looked down at his massive form, towering over the much smaller 450 pound Dominic like a colossus, the smaller man&#39;s tiny 13 inch rod spewing his pathetic load in his ass. <br />
Jeff stumbled into the room, his eyes widening in shock as he took in the sight before him. Chris and Dominic were sprawled out on the bed, their bodies entwined in a passionate embrace. But what caught Jeff&#39;s attention was the sheer size and mass of his brother&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39; muscles were gigantic, every inch of him a testament to raw power and sexuality. Jeff marveled at the sheer size and density of his brother&#39;s body which now dwarfed his own, feeling his cock grow rock hard and leaking again. <br />
<br />
Chris rose from the bed, leaving Dominic as an exhausted mass of smaller muscles behind him. Jeff stared up and up at his massive older brother, 8 and 1/2 feet tall and 900 pounds of pure alpha brawn stomped over to him. Swaying monstrously before him, Chris sported a 27 inch veiny monstrosity.</p>
