<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moments later I found myself flat on my ass on the stone ground, and everything seemed bigger to me. Orchid and Ember were both staring down at me shocked, and I looked up at them confused. &quot;Don’t worry girls,&quot; I heard a new female voice speak, and then I found myself being picked up like an infant by a dragoness who looked like a female version of Cobalt, and she had breasts the size of melons,&quot;Hey there Jewel, it’s me Cobalt, or rather Sapphire. Oh, erm sorry but you&#39;ll have to wear this for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cobalt?! What the hell?!&quot; Ember screamed, but Sapphire hushed her then said,&quot;Give me a moment, remember the laws on kids?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sapphire then pulled out two things, a diaper and a blindfold and she fastened both on me. I couldn’t see anything, but I could certainly hear and speak and I asked in the voice of an infant girl,&quot;What happend? What’th going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
I felt Sapphire pick me up and I she said,&quot;Just having fun with magic is all. Now we’re mother and daughter when we were mates. If we want to go back I&#39;ll just poke that tiny amulet around Jewel&#39;s neck.&quot; Orchid then replied,&quot;Oh, I see hm....by chance can you get something like that for us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me?!&quot; Ember shouted and Sapphire giggled and said,&quot;It’s fine, just think of it as exploring with love. Trust me this is definitely not going to be a thing once Jewel gets pregnant...er....when she’s back to her normal age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, but is Jewel fine with it?&quot; Ember asked and I replied by nodding and I said,&quot;I gueth...I can’t thpeak vewy well though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah! Well if that’s fine then I say Jewel is an adorable little hatchling, oh yes she is.&quot; Orchid cooed and I blushed and replied,&quot;I want to thee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When we get home Jewel, actually would you two like to come back too and play with her?&quot; Sapphire asked and immediately Orchid shrieked,&quot;YES!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I almost jumped where I was in Sapphire&#39;s arms, and I was up against what felt like her breast. &quot;Geez Orchid, you didn’t have to yell.&quot; Ember exclaimed then Orchid laughed nervously and said,&quot;Sorry, but she’s so cute though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...I suppose we can probably do this mother daughter thing so we can at least test stuff for our hatchlings. I just bought two-dozen diapers too so we can do this again.&quot; Sapphire said <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really buy those? Where do you keep them?&quot; Ember asked and Sapphire replied,&quot;Magic,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ember, even I know that.&quot; Orchid replied and Ember groaned. Sapphire then laughed and said,&quot;Well why don’t we head out so we can all have some fun with Jewel here?&quot; I didn’t hear anything else being said, but the sounds of their talons against the ground signified that they were following along. As Sapphire walked with me in her arms, her breasts jiggled and I felt them. Eventually we all stopped and I was set down then Sapphire took off the blindfold and said,&quot;We’re far enough now, so how do you think I look as a mommy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I only looked at her with my mouth agape and I blushed shocked at the thought that this woman was Cobalt. It was then Orchid leaned down and asked,&quot;Awww, can I hold her?&quot; Sapphire shrugged and glanced over at Ember who was indifferent then said,&quot;Sure, but not now because Jewel hasn’t eaten anything today, so she’s hungry, right?&quot; Sapphire looked at me grinning then I nodded wondering what would happen, and the Sapphire picked me up again but now held me up to one of her boobs. <br />
<br />
I paused looking up at Sapphire and she smiled at me then said,&quot;Go ahead, don’t be shy now.&quot; I then looked at Sapphire&#39;s nipple and I paused before I closed my mouth around it then I slowly began suckling. Ember watched this in disbelief then said,&quot;Cobalt I can’t believe you right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sapphire cousin, also what’s not to believe? I&#39;m a single mother taking care of her hatchling.&quot; Sapphire responded and Orchid commented,&quot;I don’t see a problem with this, I mean I&#39;d do the same with you if you were my daughter.&quot; Ember then blushed then smiled and hugged Orchid, but then Sapphire added,&quot;I can arrange that if you want, and you could take turns being the mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ember then blushed and said,&quot;Erm...not now,” and Orchid added,&quot;Yeah....not yet.&quot; The entire time I was clung to Sapphire&#39;s breast and I had finally begun to draw milk out from it. Sapphire seemed to take notice and she patted me on the back and said,&quot;There we go, drink up.&quot; There wasn’t much talking after that until we got back to the manor, and Sapphire lead everyone inside. I was still suckling until I felt full and Sapphire smiled then put me over her shoulder and patted my back until I let out a small belch.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place never ceases go surpise me.&quot; Orchid said looking around in awe and Ember then added,&quot;What doesn’t cease to surprise me is Sapphire&#39;s magical quirk for transformation, especially since she just breastfed her own mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, she’s my daughter not my mate.&quot; Sapphire said giggling with a wink then she guided everyone down the hall into a new room that didn’t have much of anything inside of it. Everyone walked in while I looked around curiously, but not seeing much. &quot;Tho, what&#39;th thith plathe?&quot; I asked and Sapphire set me down on the red carpet floor in the empty room. &quot;It will be our nursery, but I don’t have anything yet.&quot; Sapphire said<br />
<br />
I couldn’t walk at all on my legs so I had to crawl around until I saw Orchid lean down and pick me up. &quot;Hi there Jewel, so what’s it like being roughly 120 years old?&quot; My eyes widened for a moment and I figured that I should have a talk with Cobalt after this was done about how dragons age. As for Orchid I responded with a childish giggle while wagging my tail and said,&quot;It’th weird, but I like being young. I altho wondew what elthe Mommy can do, er....&quot; <br />
<br />
I blushed realizing that I just called Sapphire mommy, and I saw a bright smile appear on Orchid&#39;s face and I flushed deeper. &quot;Sapphire, did you just hear what Jewel called you?&quot; Ember watched all of this and blushed then she covered her mouth and groaned,&quot;Whyyyy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sapphire blushed too at this point then smiled and said,&quot;Well, as long as you’re just saying that because it’s easier then calling me Sapphire it’s fine. But I don’t want you imprinting on me, so I think that this has to end.&quot; Orchid then whimpered,&quot;Aww, but it was cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sapphire nodded then she said,&quot;I know, but Ember is right about there being a limit to this. So just set her down, and I’ll do the rest.&quot; Orchid nodded then she set me down on the ground, ans Sapphire walked up to me. She unfastened my diaper then she touched the gem on the amulet and there again was a bright light, and now I looked up at the regular male Cobalt in my &quot;normal&quot; busty dragoness body and he helped me to my feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was....interesting,&quot; I said blushing a bit and Ember nodded still staring at us and blushing. &quot;I think that was cute, can we have one of those amulets that does that?&quot; Orchid asked and Ember&#39;s head spun around frantically and she shouted blushing,&quot;Orchid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt then laughed and said,&quot;I have plenty of enchanted amulets, so give me a moment.&quot; Cobalt then snapped his fingers and a small weird hole in space appeared and he reached in and pulled out a silver amulet with a topaz in it then tossed it to them. &quot;Here, does the same thing, the infant is whoever is wearing the amulet, and the mother is the closest person to you.&quot; Cobalt exclaimed then Orchid caught the amulet and smiled at Ember. Ember saw the look in Orchid&#39;s eyes then she said,&quot;When we get home we can use it, just don’t get it mixed up with everything as far as jewelry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Orchid sighed then she nodded, and Cobalt then handed the jewelry box that he pulled out of another portal. &quot;I have more amulets if you want to try them out. That one on your neck is a custom one so keep it safe.” Cobalt then turne to Ember and Orchid and he said,&quot;Jewel and I are going on a date later tonight, would you like to join us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ember and Orchid now looked at each other then....</p>
