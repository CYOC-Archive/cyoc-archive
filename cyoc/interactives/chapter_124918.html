<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy heard her Dad leave the bathroom as she turned the water in the shower on. The steady stream of water poured onto her body as well as her newly obtained penis. &quot;Ah!&quot; Lucy felt a slight jolt once more. She moved backwards. &quot;Just touching it makes me feel funny...&quot; she thought to herself. She looked at her new appendage in a mix of awe and trepidation. Lucy couldn&#39;t deny how weird this thing her Dad called a dick looked on her tiny body. A great deal of hair covered the skin under the fleshy stem. She touched it herself and tried to hold it in her hands, growing a little as she did. &quot;Ah! Oh no!&quot; Lucy let go as her penis flopped up and down. &quot;This stinks... How will we even hide this from Mommy?&quot; Lucy watched her penis as it shrunk once more. &quot;I guess touching it makes it hard and stopping makes it soft?&quot; Lucy thought to herself. It was annoying, but she needed to wash it. She grabbed the soap and lathered her new equipment. &quot;Ah... Hmm...Ohh...&quot; Lucy couldn&#39;t help herself as she moaned. &quot;Feels weird... but good... Ah...&quot; Lucy finished up and went back towards the shower. The stream of water came down on her dick as she touched it some more. By then it was fully erect, but she didn&#39;t feel the need to cum. She finished cleaning it completely as she took a step back again. &quot;Done!&quot; Lucy beamed as she took hold of her clean penis. &quot;It really is huge. It&#39;s bigger then my feet. Bigger then Daddy&#39;s feet.&quot; Lucy let go one final time. She closed her eyes and proceed to wash the rest of her body. She had no idea what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
In the living room Bob was in a light sleep. He was also unaware of what was about to happen; how his body was about to change dramatically. At his feet, his socks started to look baggy. His size thirteen feet were slowly shrinking. Each toe made a small popping noise as they receded slightly into his body. His big meaty feet shrank into the size of a little girls. His ankles shrunk to accommodate his new body parts. Then his legs were the next to be affected. The socks that wrapped around his feet as a bag came off as his tiny feet receded into his pants. The hair on his legs was reduced to nothing as his leg muscles depressed into his body. Underneath his shirt his eight pack abs feel down in his stomach. His pectorals did the same as they took of formless, almost feminine shape. His whole upper body caved into itself. His head pushing into his shirt which was now draped around him. The last of the muscles in his arms disappeared as his arms pushed back into his body. His hands disappeared into the fabric as they shrunk just like the feet. In the darkness of his clothes Bob&#39;s face made a transformation in a familiar face, his Adam&#39;s apple gone for good.<br />
<br />
Back in the shower Lucy was washing herself. She hummed a song from her chorus class as he own body went through a stunning transformation. Her tiny feet enlarged and gained a little bit of hair. Her tiny toes made small popping noises as they became as big as her fingers. Her ankles expanded to fit her new body parts as her legs jutted up from her feet exploding with muscle and hair. On her stomach, eight pieces of rock hard meat pumped up and out in the shape of a rectangle. Her soon to be forming breasts changed course and became the pectorals of a young man. Lucy&#39;s tiny body looked out of place with her long legs and prized musculature, but not for long. The rest of her body followed suit as if her upper body had exploded with skin. Her arms and hands matched her legs and feet. Her meaty mitts continued to rub shampoo in her shortish hair. Hence she failed to notice that her hair had shrunk into her scalp somewhat. Her face took on a familiar shape as she rinsed the shampoo out of her hair. A circular shaped objects jutted out of her neck. She finished just as her transformation was complete.<br />
<br />
Turning the shower off, Lucy went get a towel. &quot;Huh? That&#39;s strange. Must have fallen on the floor?&quot; Lucy, unaware of how tall she was, thought to herself as she bent down and reached a towel. She rubbed her hair as she moved up towards the mirror. She rubbed it with her towel as she got a good look at her face. &quot;Dad? What are you doing back... here...?&quot; Lucy started talking , but noticed her words coming out of her Dad&#39;s mouth. &quot;Da...Daddy...?&quot; &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!&quot; Bob woke up to the screaming. &quot;Ack! Who turned of the lights?!&quot; He was in total darkness. The shock made him fail to notice his high pitched voice. Bob tried to get up but tripped on his pants. &quot;Ahh!&quot; He tumbled down. &quot;What the hell?! Huh?! What happened to my voice?!&quot; Bob tried to get himself in order as he leapt out of his pants and back into the bathroom. &quot;Lucy?! What&#39;s wro...?!&quot; But before Bob could finish, he was shocked by the sight of what was his body looking down at him. &quot;Daddy?&quot; the man asked in a quivering voice. Bob looked down at his shirt would was draped all over his body. He desperately tired to pull it off, and when he did, was greeted to the sight of a little girl&#39;s body. Bob looked up again. &quot;Lu... Lucy?&quot;  The two started at each other for what seemed like an eternity until what had just transpired overwhelmed them to... &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot;</p>
