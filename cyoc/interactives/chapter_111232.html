<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lane was a 5-year old girl with a love for princesses. Her mother and her were heading to a fantasyland store.<br />
Lane was bouncing up and down, her blonde hair and her white dress (that were past her knees) were jumping with her.<br />
<br />
When they got there, Lane&#39;s mother told her to go look around for something she liked.<br />
Lane was looking through the back of the store and saw a pretty pink ball gown. She was infatuated by the possibilities. The only problem was that it wasn&#39;t in child sizes, only adult.<br />
Lane didn&#39;t care about it and told her mother about it.<br />
&quot;You want THAT?&quot; Lane&#39;s mother bit her lip, holding back her laughter.<br />
Lane nodded with an excited smile, her blue eyes shimmering with hope.<br />
Lane&#39;s mother was holding her laughter when she told her daughter that it was too big for her and that she would need &quot;mounds&quot; and &quot;legs&quot; to fit.<br />
Lane scowled and started walking away.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of her eye though, she saw a brown book out on the ground. Lane picked it up out of curiosity. The book magically changed from brown with nothing on it to pink with sparkles and a tiara.<br />
<br />
Lane opened the page and the cover page read:<br />
<br />
                  Princess Annabelle<br />
             And her royal adventures<br />
<br />
Lane&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement.<br />
She had learned how to read a few weeks ago and was excited to read for the first time on her own outside of kindergarten.<br />
Lane brought the book to her mother.<br />
Her mother took the book and held it while Lane was looking for more princess stuff.<br />
The book changed once again from pink to black with gold letters that said &quot;Haley and the beanstalk&quot;<br />
<br />
Lane&#39;s mother, who was puzzled at Lane&#39;s taste in books, put it in the bag.<br />
Lane had returned with a paper tiara on.<br />
When Lane returned to her house, she took the book and jumped on her pink bed and opened the book to the first page. She read the big letters and easy vocabulary in her high voice,<br />
<br />
  &quot; Once upon a time, there was a princess named Annabelle.&quot;-Lane stopped and looked at the picture, then turned the page-&quot;She loved walking outside and went on them often with the royal dog, Rufius.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lane put the book down and felt hungry. She headed to the kitchen. She had a shiny fridge that reflected everything.  Lane stood in front of it and saw not a 5 year old, but an 8 year old. She was six inches taller than before. Her white dress was still below her knees. Lane thought nothing of it.<br />
She searched the fridge and found a chocolate bar. She ate through that easily. She returned to her book. She was at the next chapter, the pages had more words on them and were smaller.<br />
&quot;But one day, while Annabelle was walking, she saw that Rufius was gone! Annabelle searched high and low but didn&#39;t find him anywhere.<br />
She went back to the castle and saw that Rufius was alive. She was beaming and relieved that her dog was with her once again.&quot;<br />
Lane&#39;s reading was interrupted.<br />
&quot;Lane! Can you get the jar of flour on the top shelf?&quot; Her mother was yelling from the kitchen.<br />
&quot;Sure thing, mom.&quot; Lane put the book down and walked downstairs to the kitchen once more. She passed the fridge and saw a 10-year old with a striped dress. She was 3 inches taller than before.<br />
Lane had gotten the flour of the top shelf, something she wasn&#39;t able to do before, and handed it to her mother.<br />
Lane then went back to reading. Chapter 3 was what she was on.<br />
&quot;Annabelle saw a black knight on a horse by her usual hiking path. Rufius barked and the knight came forward towards Annabelle.<br />
-page turn- <br />
The knight got off his horse and bowed to the princess. &#39;Milady, I come from far off in search Of a woman who would come with me on a quest that is dangerous and requires courage...&#39;<br />
Annabelle was hoping that he would ask her. She did not like going on the same routine.<br />
&#39;... Do you know anyone that would like to come with me?&#39;<br />
Annabelle was not happy and said,<br />
&#39;Yeah, I can go.&#39;<br />
The knight was shocked at her answer and replied, &#39;But you are a princess! Surely you cannot venture out to the wilderness as fragile as you are!&#39; &quot;<br />
-end chapter-<br />
<br />
Lane felt that she needed to shower.<br />
She went to her bathroom and took off her clothes in front of her mirror.<br />
She was 14. She had little juvenile breasts and slightly thick legs. She was 3 more inches taller. Her lighter than before-blonde hair was covering her her naked breasts.<br />
She went into the shower and used her favorite blue shampoo.<br />
She washed her hair and then used fruit scented shampoo to wash her body. She washed under arms and face. She even washed her now pubic hair dotted crotch.<br />
She emerged cleaner than before and put her white and black patterned dress back on.<br />
<br />
She continued onto the next chapter.<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;Of course I&#39;m gonna go!&#39; Annabelle said.  <br />
The knight took off its helmet and revealed a female woman, &#39;Well, if you say so. Then let&#39;s go.&quot; The woman put her helmet on and jumped on her horse.<br />
Annabelle called for a mustang and one came. Annabelle quickly tamed it and both of the women rode.<br />
They slowed when they reached a cave. It was dusk time and they had settled down for the night.<br />
The knight had her helmet off again and told Annabelle, &#39;I&#39;m Maylene. Nice to be questing with you.&#39; &quot;  -chapter end-<br />
Lane was hungry again.<br />
She headed to the kitchen and opened the fridge but saw nothing there.<br />
She closed it and saw her reflection.<br />
An 18 year old teen with thick legs and hips with a big ass. Her hair was silvery blonde and in curls. She had nice DD cup breasts. Her face was sleek and lady-like.<br />
Lane had on a clevage revealing white with black swirls short dress.<br />
Lane went into her pantry and took some bread and made toast.<br />
<br />
Lane was full with bread and it was late. She made a bath (even though she showered 30 minutes before) and went it in.<br />
She played in the bath. She fondled her boobs and &quot;pleasured herself&quot;.<br />
<br />
She put on a night gown and went to sleep. Still thinking about her book.<br />
<br />
She woke up and read chapter 5 (Its so long that I can&#39;t even type it so I&#39;m just going to summarize it for you)<br />
<br />
Annabelle and Maylene continue and find a dragon who is controlled by an evil warlock.<br />
<br />
Lane feeling the urge for waffles so she went to IHOW.<br />
She put on a plain outfit in front of her mirror. She was 24 years old and had F cup breasts with thick and long legs with silvery hair. She decided to wear yoga pants and a tight shirt with no bra on, leaving her boobs to sway freely with every step.<br />
<br />
When she returned, she saw she was reading the last chapter of her book.<br />
(To be quick, I&#39;ll summarize again.)<br />
<br />
Annabelle and Maylene defeat the warlock and they are deemed saviors and Annabelle kisses a prince. The end.<br />
<br />
Lane was saddened by the end of her book. She decided to sell it. Lane got up and got ready for her day at work. She was 35, her face had a few wrinkles. Her silver-blonde hair was to her stomach and her breasts were perky. She put on her tight bra and even tighter clothes and left to her job at McMorky&#39;s.<br />
She sold her book to a mother of 3 girls. The mother&#39;s name was Lily.<br />
The book changed for her family and  was Haley and the Beanstalk.</p>
