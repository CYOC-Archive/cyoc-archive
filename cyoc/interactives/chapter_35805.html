<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author's note: I did not realize that Jack O'neill was no longer in command of the SGC. It is instead Major General Hank Landry, Brigadier General Jack O'neill heads the Department of Homeworld Security. For those of you who don't know, this is from the TV show Stargate: SG 1.)<br />
<br />
Shawna and Rainna were sitting in General Landry's office after teleporting the President back to the Oval Office.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's Qirmallah like?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a beautiful world of lush, green jungles&quot; Shawna said. &quot;There are a variety of animals and plants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your civilization?&quot; Hank asked. &quot;How technologically advanced are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have little use for technology&quot; Rainna said. &quot;We live in harmony with the jungle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, tell me a little bit about your society&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is an Amazon society&quot; Shawna said, &quot;it is composed entirely of women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're...&quot; Hank hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dikes, lesbians&quot; Shawna supplied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that&quot; Hank said. &quot;So you're all like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All except for Rainna&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm actually from a different planet in the system called Vashnoor&quot; Rainna said. &quot;It's similar to Qirmallah except there's both men and women.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you say that you're Shawna's sister?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because my birth parents were killed by the Barbarians&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry to hear that&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was very young when it happened&quot; Rainna said. &quot;They died saving the Queen of the Black Amazons at the time. She took me in and raised me as her own in gratitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long ago was this?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was 300 years ago&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you certainly look good for your age&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are nearly immortal General&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, call me Hank&quot; Hank said. &quot;I'm just curious about something. If your all lesbian then where do your children come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We mold clay statues of the girl we want&quot; Shawna said. &quot;It is then taken to the High Witch to be given life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I find that hard to believe&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you come to Qirmallah we'll be able to show you the process&quot; Rainna said. &quot;I would imagine that there will be many wanting children when we return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many children have you brought to life?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In my 50 years as High Witch I've only brought ten children to life&quot; Rainna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only ten in 50 years?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to understand that we are nearly immortal General&quot; Shawna said. &quot;If we brought children into our world as fast as you do here, our world wouldn't be able to sustain us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, it would wear me out having to bring them to life and name them&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
Just then a voice at the door said &quot;You wanted to see me General Landry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah Teal'c&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
Before Hank could say anything else Rainna jumped up and pointed her staff at Teal'c.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is not human&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is indeed correct&quot; Teal'c said. &quot;I am Jaffa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that he wasn't human?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can sense it&quot; Rainna answered. &quot;His kind attacked our planet 500 years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now how do you know that?&quot; Hank asked. &quot;According to you, you're only 300 some odd years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am 313 years old&quot; Rainna said. &quot;To answer your question, part of my training to become High Witch was becoming familiar with those that have attacked our planet in the past. This included learning the sense they give off. I'll admit that his sense is a little different from what I learned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said that the attack on your planet happened 500 years ago&quot; Teal'c said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I may be able to explain&quot; Teal'c said. &quot;There is a rumor that 500 years ago Ra tried taking a jungle planet. It is said that the inhabitants of that planet fought with powers equivalent to those of the gods. Ra's Jaffa were nearly wiped out in the attempt. The difference that you sense is because I no longer carry a larval Goa'uld like the Jaffa that attacked your planet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Put down your weapon&quot; Hank said. &quot;Teal'c is on our side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rain&quot; Shawna said putting her hand on Rainna's shoulder. &quot;I believe that we can trust Teal'c. General Landry certainly does.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With my life&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I'll back off for now&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that you will come to trust me in time&quot; Teal'c said.<br />
<br />
Rainna lowered her staff and when she did the fossil began to glow with a golden light.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was starting to wonder when Dondor was going to show himself&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rainna's spirit guide&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
Rainna turned her staff horizontal and let go. The staff just hung there in mid-air with the fossil glowing. After a few seconds streams of that golden light came out of the fossil and flew around the room. Those streams soon coalesced into the form of a bird. The light faded and a bird that looked like a parrot was flying around the room. It came to rest on Rainna's staff.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about time you showed up Dondor&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now is that any way to talk to me after nearly 30 years?&quot; Dondor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your head was brought back together a few hours ago&quot; Rainna said. &quot;I was expecting you to appear right then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It took me awhile to reestablish the link to this plane of existence&quot; Dondor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry for my impertinence&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are forgiven&quot; Dondor said. &quot;I have a few things to say so listen well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Dondor&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, you can trust Teal'c&quot; Dondor said. &quot;He has fought for the freedom of all people from the Goa'uld. Second, I have news of what's going on on Qirmallah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell us this news&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was getting to that&quot; Dondor said. &quot;The Barbarians have destroyed much of the jungles in the three years since they attacked. The have transformed most of the Amazons into weak versions of themselves. They have even forced them to have sex with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's horrible!&quot; Shawna exclaimed. &quot;Being forced to have sex is bad enough but with a male. It makes me sick thinking about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with having sex with a male?&quot; Teal'c asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not into males Teal'c&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not understand General Landry&quot; Teal'c said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have sex exclusively with other women&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do they reproduce?&quot; Teal'c asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you later&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I get back to telling you my news?&quot; Dondor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you General Landry&quot; Dondor said. &quot;As I was saying, most Amazons have been transformed into weak versions of themselves. There are however some who have so far been able to escape that and are fighting. They have succeeded in small attacks so far, freeing some of the transformed Amazons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to ask this question&quot; Rainna interrupted. &quot;Have any of the transformed become pregnant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There have been many that have&quot; Dondor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens to the children?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Barbarians kill the girls and take the boys somewhere&quot; Dondor said. &quot;They have hidden them well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm really beginning to dislike them&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll like them even less once you hear this then&quot; Dondor said. &quot;The two bodies that hit your iris were two of the transformed Amazons. The barbarians had sensed that something was wrong and so sent them through as a test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I want to go kick their collective ass&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
Just then the alarm sounded throughout the base.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unscheduled wormhole activation&quot; a voice said over the PA. &quot;Incoming traveler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not again&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
They made their way down to the control room. &quot;What do we have?&quot; Hank asked when they arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;The IDC matches the Barduu's sir&quot; a sergeant said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may make a suggestion&quot; Shawna said, &quot;keep that iris closed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if it's more of your people?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It will be sad but we can't take the chance that the Barbarians will come through in force&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
Hank thought for a second then said &quot;Open the iris.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir&quot; the sergeant said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me to the Gate Room&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
They arrived in the Gate Room just as ten transformed Amazons came tumbling out of the gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold your fire!&quot; Hank commanded.<br />
<br />
A Barbarian came through then with a weapon and started firing. Rainna held out her left hand, palm toward the Barbarian, and used a little magic to push him back through the gate. The gate then disengaged.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, we could have used that P90&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Rainna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matter can only go one way through the Stargate&quot; Teal'c said. &quot;If something tries to go through the opposite way, it's atoms are scattered in space.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In other words, that Barbarian is dead and the P90 is destroyed&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not realize that&quot; Rainna said. &quot;I was hoping to send him back in the hopes that they might think twice before coming through again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's time we do something about this&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree&quot; Shawna said looking at the transformed Amazons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a medical team down here!&quot; Hank ordered.<br />
<br />
A couple of hours later they were in the briefing room.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Amazons are physically fine&quot; the doctor said. &quot;The problem is their mental state.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sir, they seem to be lost and they're showing signs of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome&quot; the doctor said. &quot;I can understand them being lost since their bodies are not what they're used to. As for why they're showing signs of Post Traumatic Stress, I don't know if that's due to the fact that their bodies have changed or from some other cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than likely they have been forced to have sex with males&quot; Rainna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being raped would explain the symptoms&quot; the doctor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are any of them pregnant?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One is&quot; the doctor said. &quot;She's about six weeks along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then she stays here&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not in the nature of Amazons to stay anywhere if there is a battle&quot; Shawna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't put a pregnant woman, Amazon or not, into a situation where she could die&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's understandable&quot; Rainna said. &quot;She'll have to accept that she won't be able to go into battle for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the others fit to fight?&quot; Hank asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Physically yes&quot; the doctor said. &quot;However, I wouldn't recommend sending them to fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll need every available body we can get&quot; Hank said. &quot;Shawna, will they follow your orders?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Black Amazons will&quot; Shawna answered. &quot;I'm not sure if the White Amazons will follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would they not follow you?&quot; Teal'c asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are a different tribe&quot; Shawna answered. &quot;There are two major tribes of Amazons on Qirmallah, the Black Amazons and the White Amazons. I am Queen of the Black Amazons but I have no authority over the White Amazons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They may if we explain the situation to them&quot; Hank said. &quot;Now, how many Barbarians will we encounter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Approximately 1000 with P90s and grenade launchers&quot; Teal'c said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've faced worse odds&quot; Hank said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed&quot; Teal'c said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I need you to get whatever Amazons you've recruited here in one hour Shawna&quot; Hank said. &quot;We'll embark in six hours. Will that be enough time for the Amazons to be trained?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe it will give them sufficient training in using P90s, grenade launchers, and Zats&quot; Teal'c said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, you leave in six hours&quot; Hank said.</p>
