<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Without a word, Josh flung open a nearby door and shoved Kyle inside. It was a classroom, empty during lunchtime. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are we--&quot; Kyle started to ask as he turned back around to look at Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;On your knees.&quot;<br />
<br />
The gorgeous athlete was staring down at Kyle, an expression of pure lust in his dreamy eyes. Kyle&#39;s head swam. Was this really happening? &quot;This is insane,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I have to stop this before it gets out of hand. I&#39;m not gay, I&#39;m just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, on your knees!&quot; Josh&#39;s voice was more forceful this time. He was unbuckling his belt.<br />
<br />
For some reason, hearing Josh speak so powerfully shook something inside of Kyle and he found himself dropping down involuntarily. &quot;Why did I do that? I&#39;m not really going along with this, am I? I can&#39;t... I can&#39;t... do... do that. That would be... I&#39;m not...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh&#39;s cock hung inches from Kyle&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
It was... huge. A massive 8-inches, much like Kyle&#39;s own newly-enlarged member down below. But it was more than just big, it was somehow... beautiful. Josh&#39;s blonde pubes framed the base of the thick, veiny shaft and precum glistened at the tip. The sight awakened something deep within Kyle, a hunger. His own member was straining against his jeans down below, the stain from his own precum expanding rapidly. That head looked so... delicious. What would it taste like...?<br />
<br />
Kyle shook himself. &quot;No,&quot; he thought, &quot;I can&#39;t suck Josh&#39;s dick. That would be gay. I&#39;m not... well at least I don&#39;t think that I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked up.<br />
<br />
Josh stared down at him with a devilish (and heartrendingly sexy) grin. That blonde hair had flopped down again, shadowing his eyes. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; he said with a smirk, &quot;Suck it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle opened his mouth to object... <br />
<br />
...but at that moment something snapped and he found his open mouth suddenly wrapping tightly around the head of Josh&#39;s cock. It was divine. The taste, the texture, feeling of that huge, throbbing head filling his mouth. It was almost more than Kyle could handle. He was lost in it, sucking , licking the shaft, kissing the head, and shooting slutty looks up at Josh while he did so. It was as if Kyle was driven by some powerful instinct he had never known before, and he found himself loving every second of it. <br />
<br />
Of their own accord, his hands reached up and began fondling Josh&#39;s balls, feeling their satisfying weight. His mind raced at the thought of how much cum they no doubt contained. He needed to get it out, needed to taste that cum on his tongue like back in the bathroom. But it was too much. The cock was just too big. He had to open his mouth as wide as he could just to fit around it, and even then he could only get about a third of the way down it before it reached the back of his throat and activated his gag reflex. Even while some suppressed part of Kyle screamed internally at the sheer madness of what he was doing, Kyle found himself panicking that he might not be able to fully pleasure his prince. He wasn&#39;t good enough. He wasn&#39;t--<br />
<br />
Josh let out a long moan. Looking up, Kyle could see that the breathtaking blonde had thrown his head back and was leaning against the wall, unable to stand up straight. His eyes were closed and his mouth hung open, almost as if he were in pain. It made Kyle&#39;s heart leap. &quot;I&#39;m doing it,&quot; he thought, mouth still wrapped around that delectable cock, &quot;I&#39;m really making my prince happy!&quot; He redoubled his efforts, swirling his tongue around the swollen head with reckless abandon.<br />
<br />
Strong hands grasped the sides of Kyle&#39;s head, fingers gripping him through his long hair. &quot;Oh... you&#39;re such a natural, slut,&quot; Josh moaned from above.<br />
<br />
The words caused something to suddenly shift inside of Kyle, like a part of him long dormant was awakening from a long slumber. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s what I am...&quot; he thought, &quot;I&#39;m a good little... slut.&quot; Josh&#39;s hands pulled Kyle further down onto the cock and  to his delight, Kyle found that his gag reflex had disappeared. His toes curled at the satisfying sensation of  the head slide deeper and deeper into his throat, filling him up inch by inch. <br />
<br />
There Kyle was, on his knees, deep-throating his athletic classmate in the empty classroom during lunch. Some voice in the very back of his head seemed to be saying that this wasn&#39;t right, but it was as if the voice was coming from too far away to really hear or care about. All that really mattered was the feeling of that cock sliding in and out of his throat. He savored the moments when he reached the base and his nose was buried in Josh&#39;s bush. The musk of the larger athletic boy was overwhelming. Kyle would flick his tongue out every time to tease Josh&#39;s balls, and could feel his classmate shiver in response whenever he did so.<br />
<br />
The pace of Josh&#39;s thrusting began to increase and Kyle grew giddy with anticipation as he realized he would suddenly get as much cum as he could eat. But at that moment, he felt Josh&#39;s cock slip from his mouth and, before he could say issue any protest, powerful hands grabbed him by the shoulders and lifted him to his feet. <br />
<br />
Kyle stood there for a moment, staring up into Josh&#39;s eyes. (Had he always been this much shorter than Josh, or was he getting shorter?) And then Josh was on him, muscular arms pulling Kyle into a deep kiss. Josh&#39;s tongue probed Kyle&#39;s mouth just as his cock had only moments before. Kyle moaned as he felt one of Josh&#39;s hands reaching down Kyle&#39;s pants and grabbing his swollen dick. Kyle lost himself in the kiss, running his hands up Josh&#39;s toned abs and smooth chest. This guy was... incredible.<br />
<br />
But in a moment it was all over. Suddenly Josh was spinning him around and shoving him forward into the teacher&#39;s desk. Kyle fell forward, catching himself just before his face slammed against the wood. &quot;Wait, what are you...&quot; he managed to ask before Josh grabbed his pants and underwear and yanked them down, exposing Kyle&#39;s bubble butt to the cool air.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt his face blushing as he remembered all of his previous times being pantsed by guys like Josh. The shame, the embarrassment was what had gotten him into this mess in the first place. If only he hadn&#39;t been so stupid, calling Jen like that, then he wouldn&#39;t be here, bent over a desk with...<br />
<br />
A hot, wet shaft was gliding slowly up and down between his cheeks. The realization of what was about to happen terrified Kyle, but it was also awakening a need in his ass... a need to be filled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmm,&quot; Josh moaned lowly from behind him, &quot;You&#39;ve got an ass that could drive a dude crazy.&quot; Josh increased the tempo of his sliding, teasing Kyle&#39;s hole with his huge head with every pass.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s heart was racing. &quot;I&#39;ve got to do something,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I&#39;ve got to get out of here and find Jen and stop all of this before... ohhh....&quot; Kyle realized he was moaning quite loudly and quite involuntarily. &quot;But every time he hits my hole, it&#39;s just... mmmmm, I need... NO, snap out of it Kyle! Say something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; he managed to choke out between moans, &quot;Josh, please...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh spanked Kyle&#39;s ass. Hard.<br />
<br />
It was just like when he&#39;d spoken forcefully earlier. Kyle was instantly broken. <br />
<br />
He squealed like a little slut and moaned loudly. &quot;Fuck me, Joshy, pleeeeeease!&quot; He wanted, no, needed to feel that cock in his ass immediately. He needed it more than he had ever needed anything before. If he didn&#39;t get it soon, he would just...<br />
<br />
And then he felt it. Josh&#39;s head plunged into him, lubed by the blowjob Kyle had given him earlier. It slid with ease into Kyle&#39;s needy asshole, deeper and deeper, pumping in and out.<br />
<br />
Kyle was in ecstasy. He blanked out. It felt sooooo good... good beyond words. His whole body shook with every thrust into his aching boypussy. Josh&#39;s cock was reshaping him, reprogramming him. It was like he was being transported to another world.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like a blissful eternity, Kyle opened his eyes and realized that he and Josh were no longer alone in the classroom. A cluster of students had gathered in the doorway. They seemed to be very amused by the scene of Josh fucking the school slut over a desk. Some were shaking their heads, others rolling their eyes. Still others had pulled out their phones to record it.<br />
<br />
The thought of being recorded like this should have horrified Kyle, but instead he found himself grinning stupidly and winking at the cameras. &quot;Mmmmm... Joshy&#39;s cock is soooo good,&quot; he thought to himself as he forced himself up to his elbows and struck a pose for the cameras, &quot;why shouldn&#39;t I want everyone else to know how good he fucks me. Maybe it&#39;ll make some girls jealous?&quot; That last thought pleased him a lot, and made him smirk seductively at the phone cameras across the room. He held up a hand by his face and flashed a cute &quot;V&quot; sign for his audience.<br />
<br />
The look drew reactions from the onlookers. Laughs, jeers, disgusted murmurs. Kyle loved them all. He was a proud slut, and needed the attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh,&quot; he moaned as loudly as he could for the cameras, while Josh pumped harder and harder inside of him, &quot;FUCK yes, Joshy. Mmmmm, deeper. Fuck my tight little boypussy as deep as you can. Oh god...&quot;<br />
<br />
His performance seemed to egg Josh on. He began thrusting faster, deeper than before. Kyle drifted to the edge of unconsciousness as the larger blonde pounded his prostate almost to climax. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re even sluttier than I thought,&quot; Josh whispered in his ear with another powerful thrust, &quot;guess everything they say about you is true.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the back of Kyle&#39;s mind, that voice was screaming now, telling him that he had to stop this before he came, that it would be the point of no return. For a brief moment, the grin faded from Kyle&#39;s face and he doubted whether or not this was all right.<br />
<br />
Josh spanked him. Again. Harder.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s mind exploded. As if from a great distance he could hear himself screaming in the classroom, begging for Josh to fuck him harder, deeper, faster. Something was welling up inside him, building with every thrust against his aching prostate. He was close. He was about to...<br />
<br />
Behind him, Josh cried out, his voice cracking. &quot;Fuuu-uuuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle could feel Josh&#39;s cock pulsing furiously deep inside of him. The feeling of warmth from Josh&#39;s seed filling him up was what drove Kyle over the edge. It was the most mind-blowing orgasm he could ever imagine. His engorged cock exploded beneath him, soaking his chest and shirt with hot, sticky cum.<br />
<br />
Kyle passed out, collapsing onto the desk. The last thing he remembered was feeling that hot, slick cock slide out of him one last time.</p>
