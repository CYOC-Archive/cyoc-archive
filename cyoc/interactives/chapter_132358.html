<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the UFC-A&#39;s leadership continued to handle the arrangement for plans for the first UFC-A tournament, Amos, Buford, Esteban, and Larry continued going through the process of training for it. All of them had some experience with some nature of combat, though none of it was exactly formal, which on some level would help with the more free form rules in MMA. However, there were still rules that related to what sort of blows were legal and what were not, and preparing for that was actually where the Project White Lily needed the most training.<br />
<br />
More often than not, they&#39;d gotten some coaching from Mario, as the male Pachycephalosaurus Dinotopian did have experience in boxing, both as a competitor and as a trainer in Italy. He&#39;d provided some good instruction on what to do and how to deliver punches. The four of them caught on rather well to this and would repeat many of the things that were advised as the things to do as part of the training. This included throwing punches at a punching bag to practice form, jumping rope to stay light on their feet, and even practicing with each other using pads as the targets to punch at to work with their reflexes. Normally, this would be something that would be done with a personal trainer, but since four of them had been close and were generally learning a lot of the same lessons, it was agreed to let them practice together. Especially since only Larry and Amos would be in the same weight class.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never figured there was so much in this that would involve footwork,&quot; Larry commented, &quot;throwing a punch is a pretty simple thing to manage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably the difference between some bar room brawl and an actually competitive punch,&quot; Buford commented as he threw a few practice punches at the punching bag that Larry was holding, &quot;Like matching a guy you know who is big and strong but only knows a free for all fighting style you only see on the streets... against... say Tyson in his prime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where a lot of the goals are different than simply winnin&#39; the fight,&quot; Amos commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the former will leave himself open to a punch he can&#39;t take,&quot; Esteban commented, &quot;I&#39;ve even seen that with some drunken rum filled dummies from time to time.&quot;<br />
<br />
They continued on with Esteban moving the pads that were strapped to his hands at various positions at head, neck, chest, and gut area. Amos&#39;s goal was to hit the pad and even guess as to where Esteban would move it, essentially testing his reaction speed and would help in responding to things that an opponent did. Buford continued to throw punches at the punching bag that Larry was holding, honing his strength and perfecting his form. Larry could feel the impact from each punch go through the bag, and could tell that the Bull Shark Animalian was far stronger than he&#39;d been before his conversion. A part of Larry even wondered if this was in its own way a form of training, that by steadying the bag he&#39;d be increasing his ability to take punches, though a part of him figured that was purely &quot;Karate Kid&quot; movie magic and not actual training.<br />
<br />
They had gotten a few tips here and there from some of the local dojos on other martial arts forms, but this was more learn basic roles and maneuvers to help them in moving around the ring than many of their specific combat styles. A couple of lessons did include those things, but with the heavy focus on picking up at least basic boxing skills, the four of them didn&#39;t go beyond basic introductory sessions. Though they did raise some questions that stuck in the back of their minds and particularly in Esteban&#39;s. Though for the moment, they kept at their training session with the only sound at the moment being the sound fists hitting pads or leather. Though, after a few moments they couldn&#39;t hear Buford throwing punches anymore and there was a pause.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; they heard Buford muse as he looked at the punching bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Amos wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just looking at the punching bag... looks like there are fine scratches in it,&quot; Buford commented, &quot;it&#39;s not torn or anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably just the rubbing of your skin against it,&quot; Esteban commented, noting that Buford wasn&#39;t wearing gloves at the moment and that shark skin was both tough and sharp.<br />
<br />
It was a strong natural defense that helped sharks, particularly when they were young, but remained through to adulthood. That trait wasn&#39;t lost on shark Animalians and even Buford had noticed that. The smoothest areas on his body was around his reproductive equipment and on Aleta was on her chest. The rest was covered in the sort of sandpaper skin that sharks were known for. He&#39;d just never thought that it would leave marks on the punching bag that he&#39;d been straining with.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might help with your matches,&quot; Larry commented, &quot;Even if we have to wear gloves in them, you could check a guy and get him off balance that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t think that a shoulder check is illegal,&quot; Esteban commented, &quot;though it would leave me wondering as to what sort of moves and things would be legal or illegal with regard to some of the natural abilities we have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have any that would work,&quot; Larry commented, &quot;the frill may startle someone when I raise it... it but it would only serve as a distraction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And while my spikes could help...&quot; Amos gave a shrug, &quot;Most of them would be covered under padding and even with those that aren&#39;t... I&#39;d have to back into someone to use them which wouldn&#39;t be effective... and while the squirting blood trick would be a surprise... I don&#39;t think it&#39;d actually be a winning move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; was all Esteban managed, which earned some puzzled looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something bothering you?&quot; Buford wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it&#39;s mostly a question on what to do strategy wise,&quot; Esteban answered, &quot;As you know... turtle Animalians can remove their shells. With it removed, I can roll easier and am actually a bit faster. With it on, however, I will weigh more and can&#39;t roll forward easily, but I&#39;m better protected that way. It&#39;s all a trade off.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others slowly nodded in recognition. While all Animalians held various general traits, there were certain species specific ones that were also there certain Animalians. For turtle Animalians it was the question of whether or not to use their shell. The shell gave them greater defense but not using it gave them better mobility. Though, Larry and the others had no real advice or suggestion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What way are you leanin&#39; in all of this?&quot; Amos asked after a moment, &quot;Do you want to be able to dodge attacks or take attacks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it I&#39;m not sure on,&quot; Esteban managed, &quot;if the matches are close together, I think I may favor more defense, as if its a big tournament, I&#39;m sure it&#39;d mean taking a lot of punishment... but if they give some time between matches I might favor more mobility...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll know that until the official schedules are out,&quot; Larry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means all we can do is keep training,&quot; Esteban slowly nodded, and from there their training session resumed.</p>
