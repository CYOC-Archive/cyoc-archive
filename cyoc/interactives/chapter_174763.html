<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Ella walking toward the beach, where her sister Fizza was at ,who was 10 year old girl in a yellow swimsuit and yellow ribbon on her brunette hair, hey sis look what I got showing her the left cuff to her sister, some nice stranger gave it me for being a good girl he said it help find new friend. wow I wish I had a bracelet too do you know who gave it to you. i dunno know i couldn&#39;t quite see him in the direct sunlight he was tall though. Fizza jealous, meh i bet it just made out of plastic. just then ella skin began to pump up and down as if it was rippling wave her skin was no longer flesh or even her bone were solid anymore just a development of liquid though opaque. <br />
fizza squealing what happen to you why do look so weird, Ella kneeling down she notice her feet were no longer solid ,but rather in a liquid like state looking up toward her torso she to notice her entire entire body was water even her blue her two piece swimsuit. Maybe this ring give me superpower oh I&#39;m aqua girl protector of the deep she said proudly.<br />
Bella was immediately thrust through the air wow i have superlight I wonder what other power i can do ,{she then saw a tree} mmm how about super strength as she attempted to ram headfirst in the incoming tree instead her body splatter all over the tree bark. Her fluid began to reform itself on top a nearby branch, huh guess not she then grew brighter finding herself compelled to fly in a particular direction.  <br />
she then spotted another girl much older than her who also was glowing white. When they made contact the eyes were dead straight on each other, ella wanted to say something but a overwhelming warmth overflow her, that she never felt this way before as if she was meant to be whole with this individual and she only was a half .She slowly place her hand to the other girl hand in a mirror like position. they were 7 feet above the ground in a large patch of trees where they gradually began to rotate in a circular motion ,ella ectasy grew, as the pace of motion increase, as they  accelerated their body began to meld in to each other , a being slowly formed their breast turn into a firm d cup and a overall hourglass figure with brown hair, green eyes, fair skin .The swimsuit also fused into a mauve purple one-piece leotard the plus sign and heart symbol appear on the chest of his suit, they no her their was no ella or joey there mind had become one with bella personality trait being more prominent but no where as juvenile with a more vocabulary in her speech. she gently descended to the ground no more joey or ella now she is jella. jella let out a moan of joy having being she was happy start her new life.<br />
Jonas hiding behind a tree leisurely advanced to jella location and said so like i said before a women with a fine ass like your, got time for dinner for a guy with these gun(he began to make very muscular pose)     <br />
the women raised her head to jonas grinning in a ecstatic manner responded ,like sure but first could we bring some friends, huh didn&#39;t I say that bracelet would help you find new friends, now why head over to beach for some fun. <br />
They both smiled holding their hands as they walk toward the shoreline.<br />
fizza watch from afar eyeing the direction ella went in through a dense section of tree between the coastline and mainland.  <br />
fizza thought to herself,  ooh lucky i want to be a superhero too as she dotted the bracelet on the ground, she rush over to the object and pick it up, this must what gave her the power i hope it work for me as well, wasting no time she hastily click the cuff on left wrist hoping for the same outcome. any second now i should be able to fly (but nothing happen) oh come on! said clenching her fist.<br />
sarah couldn&#39;t believe what she saw her acquaintance liquefy, scream out in terror, then lit up like a roman candle, then found herself sprang in the air toward the beach, though sarah  couldn&#39;t get clear view on joey as she flew in a large batch of tree in the backshore. She notice the cuff she gave joey was still here, is this the the cause joey.  <br />
hey sarah where joey she supposed to take over my shift.<br />
zoe walk walk over unware what had just transpire still wearing her two piece red lifeguard issued swimsuit with the plus sign on chest. sarah startled holding the right suddenly got an idea wishing to test her hypothesis she form a plan.<br />
i think she around somewhere i was just talking to her, hey zoe could you wear this bracelet i want take a photo for my album, um okay as she clicked cuffs on. <br />
You know i feel kind of weird now ,in what way ask sarah ,like I have somewhere to be right now, just then as before the human body of zoe was no longer of any solidity but of wetness upon realization zoe she yell with such profanities.    <br />
sarah just stood there with a neutral expression observant to the ongoing events.<br />
<br />
meanwhile back with fizza her skin began to liquefy  as well, alright it finally working she said as her arm began to liquify where the cuff began to sink through her right arm falling in the sand she then jump 5 ft. in the air <br />
she wanted to fly to one of the hotel but found self in a lock direction unable to change direction, annoyed no I want to go to the roof not the forest ,as if through force of will she manage to fly toward the building but she couldn&#39;t help but feel a magnetic force was pulling her the other way. but she ignore it an almost reach the roof until a tremendous force was pushing back and grew rather bright. o come i just want to watch the wave she said as push back a few feet but fizza was undeterred she force her way back near inches from the roof and glowed as near bright as a meteorite entering orbit, an when index finger was a literal inch away from the edge of the exterior the force immediately shot her in the opposite direction with such speed that could not be seen by the human eye.    <br />
<br />
zoe confused to what happening began to glow and found herself floating in tried to hold anything she could but anything she got a grip on just slip through, she then put put her foot quite literally in the dirt where she try hold her ground but the more she did the brighter she  illuminated, when suddenly something shot at her that she didn&#39;t have time react an exploded.   <br />
As jella prior a new person immediately formed from the loose mass  first a two-piece orange bikini with plus sign, the lifeguard on the chest was replaced with lover and rather large pear-shaped to form in the bosom. Foza was her name she stood around with a confused expression not sure what just happen.<br />
sarah had ran toward the an saw the event that had taken place.so it true these thing can fuse people ha I think i,m going to some she said holding the right cuff.</p>
