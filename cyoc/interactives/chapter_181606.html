<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maria was a very confident woman who knew exactly what she wanted out of an evening. She wasn’t flustered or worried about disappointing anyone and took Janette’s awkwardness in stride. She thought it was cute that her date was in complete shock and seemed nervous to be touched and talked to. Janette had no clue what was going on. That potion she’d mixed was supposed to make her more confident, and sure Mason had definitely become more confident, but he’d also transformed into a woman and turned Hispanic. He didn’t even seem to be aware that before dinner he had been a Korean-American boy, all that he or rather she seemed to think was that she was a Mexican exchange student.<br />
<br />
She kept speaking Spanish and Janette was pretty sure it was all flirty and suggestive stuff. It got so bad that Maria asked where the toilet was and she was blushing hard, thinking before context was given that it had been flirty. She had this whole night planned, deeming their date was to be a mixture of showing off her own culture and experiencing American culture at the same time. Janette had no idea what was going on but every second she tried to bail was met with resistance and giggling laughter from Maria.<br />
<br />
“I love this part of the city,” Maria swooned as they walked through an old district that had been renovated into a trendy setting with cobblestone roads, old lights and clocks, ancient storefronts, and all sorts of outdoor dining areas. “I want to be an architect one day...”<br />
<br />
She talked for thirty minutes straight about things that just went in one ear and out the other, Janette felt stupid suddenly. Had Mason wanted to be an architect or was that just this girl. She tried to remember details about Mason. He liked movies, he was an athlete, he was her chemistry partner. She drew a blank on the rest of him. She liked science but had Mason just been there as a breadth course? Was he actually planning to be an architect? Had her potion made him confident enough to be one even if it hadn’t been what he’d been studying before? Or was Maria a completely new person that had overwritten Mason? She didn’t understand and just smiled at Maria, uncertain if she was talking to Mason, what Mason always wanted to be contaminated with Mexican food, or someone brand new.<br />
<br />
She was kind of cute she guessed, and the way she talked passionately about art, architecture, and design was confusing. Janette didn’t understand a word she was saying and yet she kind of liked listening to that passion and drive.<br />
<br />
Maria was super into her though, she kept grabbing her hand, complimenting her, and looking at her with this lovey dovey look. It’s not often you’re flirted with that hard and when you are it’s kind of hard not to return the affection.<br />
<br />
“Maybe this will wear off and Mason will come back,” Janette muttered to herself as Maria took her to a roadside stand selling all sorts of ethnic Mexican sweets and desserts. Maria seemed so happy and sweet and Janette kind of felt some ways about her too. The confidence was supposed to wear off if she remembered correctly, so it was possible Maria would only exist for a day or two at max. Why spurn a chance with a girl that into her when she’d turn back into Mason later.<br />
<br />
So Janette started to return that affection and it was amazing. She’d expected a good evening with Mason but instead she was getting one with Maria. She gawked at all sorts of sights Maria wanted to see, wound up trying some foods she’d never thought she’d liked, and wearing a few outfits from little boutiques open late on a night like that. She looked good in Mexican clothing and that surprised her. Maria took her to listen to music, they snuck over the beach closed sign and joined a bonfire on the beach, and stripped down to their underwear and dove into the cold water with shrieks and laughs. Then Maria kissed her full on lips and it made Janette’s heart feel fuzzy. She was swooning for the rest of the evening, certain she was in love with this beautiful exchange student and not wanting the night to end.<br />
<br />
After midnight things closed down and she did something she’d never done before. She went home with someone on a first date. She burst into Mason’s apartment making out with Maria and found the place matched Maria instead of Mason. Bras in the laundry, Spanish music records, and posters for Mexican boy bands and Spanish releases of movies. She wasn’t sure what Mason had lived like but she was definitely into Maria.<br />
<br />
Her date pulled herself free of her dress, standing over Janette in saltwater stained underwear looking like a supermodel. If she was being honest she was kind of hoping she would get a taste of Mason’s cock that night, but she wasn’t even disappointed. Maria looked great and her heart was hammering in her chest, somewhat hoping Mason didn’t come back. It was weird, but after the night she’d just had she was starting to feel like her crush on Mason was fading and a new interest in Maria had taken its place.<br />
<br />
She said something in Spanish that made Janette’s heart spring from her chest in glee. She wanted to learn Spanish so she could understand all the compliments their language barrier prevented her from enjoying. Maybe she could take a class, she was in a university after all, so there had to be one.<br />
<br />
She bit her lip and let her own dress slip from her body, giving her date permission to continue. Maria grinned and her smile was like a thousand stars before she set herself atop Janette and started to feverishly make out with her on the bed.</p>
