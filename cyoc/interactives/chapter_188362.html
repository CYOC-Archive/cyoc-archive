<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your group are shocked by the scene after you opened the staffroom door. All of you are hit by aphrodisiac smell that is full in the room, which makes you all horny, as well as pile of seeds spout all of the floor. There are two rubber boys; Forest (dark green) one and gold one, and sliver wolf boy who three lay on the floor with indigo boy who is sitting chair, looks at all of you.  <br />
“OK, what’s going on here?” Eric loudly asks as all of you think the same question. <br />
The indigo boy stands up with deadpan face as his dick is hard, unemotionally replies “Greeting brothers, I shall answer your question. Our little brothers who are laying up the floor were attacked by a werewolf who now is our new brother as well. The werewolf was trying to turn our two brothers into werewolves, so I decided to go through the window.” “Wait, that’s window that you talk about is that window, right?” Tom surprisingly asks as he points at the small window where is across from the door.”<br />
“How can you fit in that small window?” Eric exaggeratedly asks.<br />
“I shapeshifted myself.” The indigo boy replies as his whole body shapeshift, and then shifting back to the boy.<br />
“OK, you continue the story. May I ask little boy, who are you really?” Isaac asks <br />
The indigo boy doesn’t show any emotion on his face, dryly says “Mistake from my part. I do not have name. I have just processed my own mind this morning after you brothers, turned the gangsters into thongs.” <br />
Now you know who this boy is and shout “You were that referee doll that gangsters brought with them.”<br />
All of your brothers on the door are shocked by your outburst as the indigo boy, former referee doll shrugs to confirm. And the indigo boy continues his story “Yes, after I’d processed my own mind, I tried to find you all. Until I’d sensed that our little brothers were in danger in this room, so I came in and restrained the werewolf who was about to engage his sexual activity with our brothers” he point at the wolf boy who is laying on the floor “But there unexpected thing happened, one of the thongs on the table drove to werewolf’s dick and made the werewolf in panic. The wolf tried to free himself from my hold, but he suddenly was horny with no reason. He released his aphrodisiac pheromone made me and two brothers engage sexual activity with him. Until three of them are finished their transformation and fainted on the floor just as you all see.”<br />
All of you are dumbfounded by your new brother’s story and have no idea what to say in this situation. But Eric breaks the silent “How can he become sentinel? I mean I don’t even know our liquid can make the doll have self-aware.” “Well, the proof is in front of you, now.” Carl says but Eric rebukes “If we talk about logic, it can anyone that played the baseball after we left and got turned by the liquid.”<br />
“Indeed, that was so careless of you that didn’t clean the liquid before you left the field. I had to clean that field instead of you all to prevent someone accidentally was changed by it.” The indigo boy emotionally reports our mistakes as Jung, Leon and you laugh awkwardly. Not just you three, but Rob put his hands on the his face, Eric, Sam and Carl turns their head away as well as Tom and Isaac scratches their back heads. <br />
“OK, we are sorry for being careless but what should we call you.” Rob asks the boy as all of you think the same. “You can name even you see fit. I’m OK with it.” The boy replies and then you get the name that suit him. “How about Daniel?” As you say, everyone look at you. “Daniel is not a bad idea since you were once the judge of game.” Rob says as he proudly smiles at you. And the boy, now Daniel shows his emotion the first in front of you as he smiles “Yes, I like the name very much.” “That’s decided, then. Your name is Daniel or Dan for short.” Jung says.<br />
And you all hear groan sounds from the two boys on the floor. Tom and Isaac who two are nearest, help those boys up. “Are you two alright?” Isaac says the boys that you don’t know which one is Qadeer or which one is Uthman.” The forest boy who is pulling up, asks “What’s happened after the indigo rubber boy came to rescue us and then we had……” Just from the voice, the forest rubber boy is Qadeer who is now red from remembering before he fainted. Then the golden rubber boy is Uthman who also recalls what’d just happened.<br />
And Uthman hugs Tom with his golden rubber body as he looks at Daniel as if he wants to know who Daniel is. So Carl introduces “Qadeer Uthman, this is Daniel, your older brother.” Two shrug and greet “Nice meet you.” “Same to you two; Qadeer and Uthman.” Dan replies as Rob walks to Dan, says “Then, let’s tell you our name.” Before you and eight start to roll call your own names, Dan interrupts “There is no need; I already know all of your names.” We are paused by his words as he continues “It feels like I know all of you when I look you all. I’m pretty sure you all will know this werewolf boy’s name, too, if you guys look at him.” Just like Dan said, when we look at silver rubber werewolf child on the floor, you recognize his name immediately. This miniature of werewolf, his name is Gabe or Gabriel. <br />
But you coludn&#39;t process more, the wolf child, Gabe wakes up and looks at all of you.  Gabe angrily shouts at Dan “You” Uthman and Qadeer hide behind of Tom and Isaac. “Because of you, I turn into this rubber fuck-able doll.” And Gabe points at himself. The proud wolf is more frustrated how he falls from next line of alpha to this low sex doll. While Gabe is throwing his tantrum, you and other brothers decide to clean the pile of seed in this room, except Dan who watches over Gabe and Qadeer and Uthman who can’t control their shapeshifting. Qadeer and Uthma awes as they see the nine of you clean the room with the rubber tentacles neatly, even Gabe is impressed by what he sees. <br />
After finishing clean the room, Rob asks “What are we going with you?” points at Dan as everyone just remembers the problem. “As you guys know that people were attacked by werewolves and still scared by them, it’s not going to be a good idea to let other people see him even more as your new brother.” Now you look at it that’ll be serious problem because the enforcers are around here. Dan will be arrested by enforcers for sure. Gabe for his part, he has to agree with his new family that, because he can&#39;t go back to his old pack anymore and he has no place to go, too. Despite the threat that Dan posed to Qadeer and Uthman, now he is your brother, so you don’t want him to be arrested. <br />
“Dudes, you don’t need to worry about me. I can escape from those goons of Master.” Dan aggressively says out loud as if he wants to show his confident or he wants to ease our worry about him. Eric, Carl, Tom and Isaac smirks at his bad-boyish antic as Rob, Leon and You smile fondly at his speech, and others; Leon, Sam, Qadeer and Uthman slightly laugh at him. But Daniel doesn’t react anything, asks “Can you turn into human form?” Dan tilts his head and then, he replies “Nah, I was born a natural werewolf, I can’t turn into human since I was born. And our pack has policy that humans are lower than us werewolves, so why should we reduce ourselves to be like them.” <br />
All of you, except Dan, hear his answer, are dumbfounded. Dan says those words as if it’s matter of fact. All of you know well that’s some part are true, but it’s still a little bit hurt by those proclaim. Putting his irritate feeling aside, Rob cautiously says “That’s the problem since you can’t turn into human, you walk around. And I don’t think you sneak out of here, this much crowded people here.” <br />
Before you all could say anything, the door suddenly opens. So you and others stand blocking Dan from be seen by Alan, another staff. Mostly Alan is 25 years old and quiet person who isn’t interested in sexual activities much or not at all, you don’t know. Some staffs said “Alan is playing edging activity with his secret partner.” Or “Alan is chastity.” Alan silently watches all of you before quietly says “Looks like you guys have new family members again. Not that I concern but Lorry calls all of you, please don’t be late.” Alan comes out of the room and closes the door as you all sigh in relieve. We have other choice but going to meet Lorry as having Dan, Jung and Sam watch over Uthman, Qadeer and Gabe in this staffroom. Although Dan protest that he can be OK without our help, but better safe than sorry. <br />
At the storefront of the nightclub, After all of customers went back, your group is standing along with other staffs in front of Lorry and the head of enforcers. The head of enforcers is the bulky muscle man who looks perfect in his black prison guard uniform. After all of staffs are here, except Jung, Leon and Sam who watch Uthman, Dan, Qadeer and Gabe. Lorry finally sincerely speaks “Hello, my dear staffs. I’m so sorry for what you all have faced. And I also understand that you all are scared and even want to quite this job, I won’t stop you for that and you can come back whenever you want. This club is our home, I welcome you all anytime. And about our tragedy, this officer and his teams have already arrested some of werewolves.” All of staffs and your group are happy even the enforcers haven’t caught all of those werewolves. ‘I should tell Dan that most all of his pack can escape from enforcers, at least he’ll be happy.’ You think as Lorry continues “And our hero will tell more detail of those mutts and the situation of this.” Then Lorry steps aside and lets the officer moves to in front of us. ‘So handsome, it likes that he is prefect muscle man model of Ancient Greek sculpture.’ Some of staffs and you think as the officer looks at us.  <br />
The office dutifully says “Hello, residents in the place, I shall have you rest assured that there are no werewolves in the district anymore. But you all need to know this, the werewolves have their own social structure or heritage that split into many group. The true alpha, the leader of their pack is one that other werewolves, including other alphas, follow. Most of werewolves in pack are beta or the workers. And the last is omegas the lowest rank, whose role are alpha’s mate or children maker.” Your group wince when you all think Conner wants Carl to his Omega, makes all of you are sick “Most cases, we’ve observed, the werewolves usually change their target to beta, but in some cases, the alphas will turn their target into omega. And rare case there are people who turn into another alpha, too. You can classify those werewolves by their sizes; the bigger one are alpha, normal one are beta, and smaller ones are omega. Lastly their hunt patterns are to chase their targets. If they success, they’ll change you into one of them on spot. If not, they’ll mark you and continues to hunt you until they catch you and change you. So all you need to do when you can escape their grip is contract us to help you. And this is all I tell you.” With it, the officer and his team are leave this place, but you have felt that the officer intently stared at you and your brothers. Then Lorry announces “Alright, since our club is going be out a few days for redecorating and for customer’s safety. I’ll have you get a break 5 days come back for the ones still want to work for me.”<br />
When your group leave the storefront, you hear someone call “Guys, over here.” Leon who call you all to follow him to fire exit. The outside, Eric asks “OK, why are we here?” “It’s because of this” Leon awkwardly replies as he moves aside to show something. You are shocked that Dan is in his big silver rubber full-wolf form as he wimps.  “Please, tell me what’s happened while we are at the meeting.” Rob processes to find his voice and asks while you and others are still shocked by rubber full growth wolf.<br />
“After you guys went to meet Lorry, all of us tried to stay quiet in staffroom.  Dan felt boring and wanted to do something but some of us tried to keep him down. But he struggled and started to shift from humanoid wolf to full wolf. So Dan suggested Gabe drove out of room through the window. And here we are.” Jung replies as Qadeer and Uthman are poking Gabe. Gabe annoyingly growls at them as Dan stops him to make a sound so loud. You sigh out loud and suggest “Let’s go back to our suites. Talk here is risky.” That’s decided, everyone tries to sneak to our suites. Sneaking in the hotel isn’t hard as you expect, the receptionist didn’t against you for letting the wolf, Dan come in. <br />
In Rob’s suite room that all of you are crowded in, Rob voluntarily tell what the meeting was about to who didn’t attend. Then Rob asks “Gabe, can you still talk? And can you turn back?” Gabriel makes a wince sound and tries to stutter “Sorry, …. bro. It’s …. Hard to….talk in…..this form… I don’t……know how to …change back.” “He need to time to speak properly.” You says as he looks at Dan who struggles to change back his were-form. Eric happily states “Well, for best part, we have 5 days for doing ever we want before going to work.” And you add “Yes, and time for Qadeer, Uthman and Gabriel to practice their new body’s abilities, too.” <br />
Leon asks “And who will stay with who?” everyone looks at Leon “We only have three available suite rooms, since Jung and Alex already have Sam.” That makes you think there 13 of us now that means there’ll be three rooms have three persons and one room has four persons. <br />
Rob dutifully replies “Dan and Gabe will stays here.” “What?” Eric shouts as Rob continues “Qadeer can stay with Tom and Isaac, while Uthman stays with Leon and Carl.” <br />
Jung asks “Can your room be enough space for four persons?” Rob smiles and fondly says “Don’t worry, Eric and I will move our beds together just like yours and have Eric, Dan and Gabe sleep on the beds as I sleep with futons on the floor.” Then Gabe stomps his foreleg as if he signal that he will be the one sleep on the floor. Rob as oldest brother who should be the one who sleeps on the floor, feels complicated by Gabe’s idea, but he sees the determination in Gabe’s eyes that he isn’t going to back down, too. So Rob lets out of heavy long sigh and says “Alright, Gabe you sleeps on the floor.” Gabe shows his wolfy smirk as all of you laugh at it. “Let’s go to sleep, bro. And we talk about what we will do next, tomorrow.” Sam suggests as he yawns. With that, All of you go back to your won rooms to sleep. You, Jung and Sam climb in our beds and cuddle each other until three of us lost your conscious.</p>
