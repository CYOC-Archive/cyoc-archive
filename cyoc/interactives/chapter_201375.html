<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan sighed, trudging behind her nephew as the two now made their way through the woods. While the scenery was beautiful, it didn&#39;t mean that Morgan was excited about her nature walk. &quot;Evan what are we doing out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan now shushed her, causing the werewolf sorceress to frown at the young man. &quot;I needed to show you something,&quot; he whispered. &quot;But you need to keep your voice down.&quot; Morgan grunted in frustration, momentarily wishing she had remained in cryo sleep. As they now reached a set of trees overlooking a playground, Evan now stopped. &quot;Look!&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan narrowed her eyes, watching as a group of young teens now happily chatted in the sparsely populated playground. &quot;What do five kids have to do with the Normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not the kids I&#39;m interested in,&quot; Evan said quietly. &quot;Its their friends.&quot; Morgan now curiously watched as Evan pointed towards the otherside of the woods. As Morgan studied the area, she gasped as two kitsune kits now exited the woods. Two kits that now happily joined the young teens. &quot;Kits,&quot; she asked, trying to keep her voice low. &quot;What are two kitsune kits doing out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those arent just regular kits,&quot; Evan smirked. &quot;Take a closer look.&quot; Morgan sighed, closing her eyes as she reached out with her magic. It didn&#39;t take her long as she now gasped in shock, her eyes flying open in surprise. &quot;Celestials,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Divine kitsune! Oh my God, Evan! Where did two divine kitsune come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not from,&quot; Evan stated. &quot;But who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan raised an eyebrow, giving her nephew a curious look. &quot;You know your mother liked to be coy and mysterious to,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;It was annoying when we were growing up and its annoying now. Can you please just spit it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Evan chuckled. &quot;Bad, old habit I picked up.&quot; Clearing his throat Evan now explained the kits nature, Morgans eyes growing wide in surprise. &quot;The Catalyst created them,&quot; she said in awe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I was surprised too,&quot; Evan shrugged. &quot;I was even more surprised by who their parents were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t just leave me guessing Evan who are their parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See the white one,&quot; Evan stated, gesturing to Sachiko. &quot;The girls name is Sachiko. She&#39;s the daughter of Akira and Ayami.&quot; Morgan now rubbed her chin, a contented smile crossing her face. After protecting wizards for so many years, she found it fitting that the Akira would finally get a child of his own. &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; she smiled. &quot;After everything Akira did he deserves some happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan frowned, despite the controls the Normal had built into Morgan, it appeared she very much remained herself. Asking her to attack the kits was going to take alot of effort on his part. Fortunately, he had a feeling she wouldn&#39;t be so thrilled when she discovered Raiden&#39;s parentage. &quot;Well then you&#39;ll be shocked to find out who the other set of parents are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The black and red one is named Raiden. He&#39;s the son of Fukushu and Abolith.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan&#39;s face now formed into a scowl. Throughout her life the dark kitsune and the elf assassin had been a thorn in her families side. They had been mortal enemies of her mother, her aunt, even herself and Lynne. That the duo should be rewarded with a child seemed cosmicly unfair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats why we have to take the children out,&quot; Evan finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;What NO,&quot; Morgan exclaimed, perhaps a bit too loud as the teens and kits paused in their conversations. Evan and Morgan now backed away, glancing around before talking once more. Morgan now angrily glared at her nephew, her face becoming more feral in her anger. &quot;I am not killing children Evan,&quot; she hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thise kids are a major problem Morgan,&quot; Evan argued. &quot;They&#39;re a threat to the Normal. A threat to us! Think about it? Does Fukushu deserve to have a divine child after all he&#39;s done? What makes you think his son won&#39;t turn out exactly like him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan now angrily gazed at her nephew, her hand clapping down on his shoulder. Evan could now notice her eyes becoming a deeper amber hue as her fingernails lengthened into talons. &quot;I will not kill children Evan,&quot; she growled. &quot;Yes, Fukushu is a monster but the sins of the father do not belong to the son. Also, in case you forgot, my best friend, YOUR aunt Kari is a kitsune. If you want to punish Fukushu fine but I won&#39;t be part of murdering children. I don&#39;t care what the Normal do to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think the Boss will give you a choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The hell with this Boss,&quot; Morgan scoffed. &quot;At the end of the day my concern, and my only concern is you. I am going to keep you safe. Find a way to free us. But, what I will not do is kill children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I have to do it myself I will,&quot; Evan replied, his face forming into a scowl. &quot;Not while I&#39;m here nephew,&quot; Morgan growled. The two powerful wizards now stood eye to eye, glaring at one another. Despite being controlled by the Normal, Morgan had enough free will to act on her own accord. She wanted to redeem Evan, she believed she could given enough time. She just needed to keep him from going further down a dark path. Before Evan could answer, he was now torn away from his aunt. Crashing into a tree, he now recovered enough as he stared down his attacker.<br />
<br />
Fukushu smirked at the dark wizard, the kitsune had sensed his dark energy and attacked, useing his tails to ensnare Evan and take him away from his son. &quot;It appears the Normal have not given up their fools quest in trying to eliminate my son,&quot; he grinned. &quot;They now send a spoiled child to do what others have not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you&#39;ve made a fatal mistake fox,&quot; Evan chuckled as he now prepared to fight. Fukushu now chuckled, unsheathing his blade as he stared down Evan. &quot;I was going to say the same thing about you boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
*********************<br />
<br />
Raiden and Sachiko now tried to decide what they should do today. The weather had finally turned, the warm sun now washing over the group of friends. &quot;So what do you want to do today?&quot;<br />
<br />
An explosion now caused the group to jump in alarm. Quickly turning, Raiden gasped as he saw his fathers body rocket out of the woods before crashing to the ground. &quot;DAD!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu recovered, shaking off the blast of magic. Turning towards his son, his eyes now went wide in fright as he yelled to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;RUN! RUN RAIDEN!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raiden was frightened, confused until he saw two others leap out of the clearing. One was a young man with auburn hair, the other a silver werewolf. Both now attacked his father, hitting the nine tailed kitsune with an incredible magical blast.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAD!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu winced from the attack, grasping his blade as he now countered with a spell of his own. Knocking Morgan back, he now looked at Evan, the dark wizard staring down his son. Moving at speeds almost to quick to notice, Fukushu now tackled Evan, blasting him with a spell of his own before raising his sword. He had had enough of this dark wizard threatening his child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan NO,&quot; Morgan screamed. Fukushu looked up just in time to see the silver werewolf leap at him. Slashing him across the chest, she now conjured a fireball that sent the nine tailed kitsune sailing towards his son.<br />
<br />
Coughing, Fukushu now stood, glancing back at the frightened teens and the kits. &quot;Take your friends and run my son,&quot; he snarled. &quot;Find Yuriko and Darren. Tell them what has happened.&quot; As Raiden turned to run, he was surprised to see Evan blocking his path. A smug smirk spreading across his face. &quot;Where do you think your going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu snarled, dashing forward and knocking Evan back. Despite the kitsunes strength, Evan was far too powerful, the blow buying Fukushu enough time to get the children behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan,&quot; Morgan cried. Fukushu paused, turning as the silver werewolf began to transform. The kitsunes eyes going wide as the werewolves fur receded, her face taking on human proportions. In only seconds Fukushu now found himself gazing at a foe he had thought long dead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan frowned, glaring at the kitsune before turning to her nephew. &quot;Evan let the children go,&quot; she called. &quot;We have to destroy the kits,&quot; he bellowed, glaring at his aunt. Morgan was unfazed by Evans outburst, standing between Fukushu and Evan. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said, her voice low yet commanding. &quot;No Evan, I won&#39;t let you hurt the children.&quot; Fukushu paused, gazing at the Lycan sorceress. As he did she now turned to the kitsune, angrily staring at him. &quot;Fukushu on the other hand has been around far too long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan now smirked as the two wizards now slowly turned towards Fukushu. Although his son may be safe, it appeared he had his hands full with two old foes.</p>
