<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laughing at the picture that they had created, and unaware that it had become reality, Melissa and Jessica wondered what to do next.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we do one of Sarah next?&quot; Jessica suggested, swishing her tail as she carefully stood up to stretch her legs a little, &quot;And then we can go for a walk or something. These dorm rooms are way too small for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true too, as a centaur, she had to duck her head down when she stood up, and there was hardly room for her to turn around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Melissa snickered as she pulled up a picture of Sarah, &quot;What should we do to that boyfriend stealing cow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good to me,&quot; Jessica laughed as well as she carefully lay back down behind her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What sounds good?&quot; Melissa asked, then a look of dawning comprehension came across her features, &quot;Oh...oh! That's too good! Sarah really is a shameless come, isn't she? Let's see what this thing can do. I've got an idea. Not a total cow, just some key features...&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Sarah was out for a walk when a strange feeling came over her. A tingle ran down her back and seemed to keep going. There was a momentary pressure in the back of her pants, sending a stabbing pain up her back, then it was gone. Puzzled, she rubbed at her butt trying to figure out what had caused the discomfort.<br />
<br />
Everything seemed in order. Shrugging, she absentmindedly scratched at the coarse reddish-brown hair at the base of her tail. Maybe her pants had gotten twisted or something.<br />
<br />
She continued walking along, her tufted cow tail swishing back and forth as she went, but she didn't get very far before another strange sensation came over her. This time her feet started to hurt.<br />
<br />
Thinking that maybe her socks had fallen down and bunched up under her feet, she sat down and took her shoes and socks off.<br />
<br />
The fresh air felt nice on her toes, and she wiggled them, not realizing that the littlest toe on each foot had vanished, or that before her very eyes her nails were growing thicker and taking on a streaky brownish coloration. Her middle two toes began to grow larger while the outer two grew smaller, shrinking away to nothing as the bones of her feet elongated.<br />
<br />
When she got back up, shoes and socks forgotten entirely, she was standing on cloven hooves which clopped loudly on the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
She would have continued walking, but her cellphone rang. Clumsily taking it out of her pocket with her four fingered hand she checked and saw that she had a text from Bethany, her roommate. Bethany had locked herself out again.<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, her large, red furred ears waggling as she did, Sarah turned and headed back to the dorms to help Bethany out.<br />
<br />
When she got there Bethany was sitting outside the door to their room looking more than slightly embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; she gushed, &quot;This is like the third time this month, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was actually the fifth time, but Sarah wasn't about to say that. She was having a bit of trouble turning the doorknob. Her thick nails slipped against the metal and her four fingers were too thick and clumsy to get a proper grip on the knob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me get that for you,&quot; Bethany said in a rush, trying to save face by being helpful.<br />
<br />
Sarah stepped aside and let her get the door.<br />
<br />
Once inside their room Bethany dumped her books out on her bed and began sorting through what she needed for homework while Sarah went over to the mirror to brush her hair.<br />
<br />
As she brushed her hair she looked at her face in the mirror, admiring what she saw. Her ears might have been a bit large, but all in all they weren't that bad looking, rounded and hairy, sticking out from the sides of her head. Anyway, her horns more than made up for it, short and off while, they curved most pleasantly out from the top of her head, tapering to points. Then there was her hair itself. True it was rather coarse, but she had never met another girl who had hair that was naturally red with white streaks.<br />
<br />
Putting down the brush, she struck a pose in front of the mirror, waggling her ears and swishing her tail in a most bovine manner. Her pose caused her shirt to ride up slightly over her breasts and she tried to smooth it back into place, only succeeding in making her nipples perk up. Half an inch long and still growing, the peaks of tender flesh were easily visible despite the fact she was wearing a bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; she muttered softly to herself, still trying to adjust her shirt and failing, since now her breasts were growing as well.<br />
<br />
Does this shirt seem too tight to you?&quot; she asked, turning to face Bethany, &quot;Because I think it might have shrunk in the wash.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bethany examined her partially bovine roommate carefully and nodded, &quot;Yeah, it's way too small over your chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I thought,&quot; Sarah said and pulled off her shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh, that feels good,&quot; she sighed, rubbing her heavy breasts through the fabric of her bra, making her nipples stand up even farther, tenting the fabric of her bra.<br />
<br />
When she stopped rubbing them, her breasts rested heavily against her chest, sagging for a moment, then swelling up to retain their roundness and firmness. Growing larger still, they began to strain against the confines of her bra and a moist spot appeared over each of her erect nipples.<br />
<br />
Her ears drooped at the sight, &quot;Oh noooo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Bethany asked, alarmed by her friend's frustrated low until she saw Sarah fumbling with the straps of her bra, &quot;Oh, don't worry, I'll help you with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hurried over and helped Sarah free her breasts from her too-tight bra. Once her bra was off Sarah's breasts hung down half way to her waist.<br />
<br />
Little droplets of milk clung to the tips of Sarah's nipples, which at three inches long were easily what could be considered teats. Despite having only one teat each, her breasts looked a great deal like udders, so swollen with milk that they were each easily the size of a basketball and crisscrossed with prominent veins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again,&quot; Sarah said as she took some tissues to blot at her teats, &quot;I'm going to the bathroooommmoooooo.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had been trying to say that she was going to the bathroom to try and clean up, but to her surprise her sentence ended in a loud, perfectly cow like moo. Sarah knew that she looked a bit like a cow, but she tried hard not to act like one. Fortunately Bethany didn't seem to care.<br />
<br />
Not even bothering to cover herself, Sarah went down to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
By the time she got there milk was dripping from her teats and spattering on the floor.<br />
<br />
Trying not to make any more of a mess, she leaned over the sink and took a teat in each of her hoof-hands. Because of how inflexible her four fingers were, she was hardly able to get any milk to flow and after several minutes of trying all she had succeeded in doing was making her tender teats sore.<br />
<br />
Fighting back frustration got ready to start trying again when there was a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooo is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me,&quot; came a voice that Sarah recognized as Bethany, &quot;Is everything okay in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Sarah said softly, &quot;I'm kind of having trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Bethany stuck her head in, &quot;What sort?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rather than try to explain, Sarah demonstrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aah,&quot; Bethany nodded, &quot;Your hooves aren't really good for that sort of thing, are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo,&quot; Sarah mooed, her ears drooping.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you usually manage?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the first time I've needed milking,&quot; Sarah admitted, &quot;I figured it would happen sooooner or later, but I never really planned for what I'd doooooo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bethany patted her on the shoulder comfortingly, &quot;Do you want me to give it a try?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, if you don't mind,&quot; Sarah said, fighting back a moo of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, what do you want me to do?&quot; Bethany looked more than a little nervous as she spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess should be the same as milking a cow,&quot; she offered, unsure herself of how to do it.<br />
<br />
Bethany giggled, &quot;I've never milked a cow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now you get to learn,&quot; Sarah laughed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...&quot; she stepped behind Sarah, and gingerly took her teats in her hands, &quot;Wow, this is weird, grabbing another girl's breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're just holding my teats and milking me, that doesn't make you a lesbian,&quot; Sarah reassured, &quot;Maybe a milkmaid, but not a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing at her friend's joke, Bethany gave a gentle squeeze and was rewarded by a jet of milk shooting into the sink, &quot;Like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; Sarah encouraged, &quot;Mooooo that feels good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once she found her rhythm Bethany made good progress, and though Sarah wasn't about to say anything, she found that the sensation of being milked made her feel more than a little turned on. The combination of relief of being emptied coupled with the gentle pulling on her teats was enough to make her bring a hoof-hand between her legs to gently rub herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooo!&quot; she lowed softly, prompting a fit of giggles from Bethany.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really are just like a cow, aren't you,&quot; Bethany laughed as she gave Sarah's teats one last tug just to be sure that every last drop was drained. All that remained was a slight moistness, which she blotted away with paper towels, &quot;It's a good thing that you don't have an udder, otherwise we'd be hear for twice as long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah laughed back, taking her hoof-hand from between her legs so that she could pat her deflated breasts with both hands. Now that they were empty they were only about the size of her head and they sagged slightly, &quot;Thank you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, it's the least I could do after all the times you rescued me when I locked myself out of the room. Any time you need milking, just ask me. It was actually pretty fun, really relaxing,&quot; Bethany said, as she dried her hands and left.<br />
<br />
Sarah followed soon after, her large breasts swaying gently from side and her teats bouncing slightly as she walked.</p>
