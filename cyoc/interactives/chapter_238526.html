<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When my half--sister, Natalie, brought her new, and very first, boyfriend to the first family dinner after the Fusion Wave, we all loved him.  Jay was funny, gentle, kind, respectful, and very, very charming.  Untransformed, or unmutated, like Nat.  The rest of the family, including me, got transformed, so I guess that we were all happy that at least somebody close to us was lucky enough to live, compared to most of the rest of the world, a relatively normal life, with a relatively normal future.<br />
I hate to admit it, but at the time, despite what we said or did to comfort ourselves and each other, we were disgusted and repulsed by our new forms.<br />
<br />
Dad was still coping with the fact he now inhabited the body of a 17-year old brunette after a mind swap.  To say that it&#39;s simply &quot;busty&quot; would be an understatement, considering he has to maintain 4 pairs of breasts.  And all the emotional and mental changes, self-hate, and shame on top of it . . . shoot.<br />
<br />
My older brother and his wife had celebrated the birth of their first child one month before the Wave hit, and due to both this and their conjoinment, I would be putting it lightly if I said that their relationship simply &quot;suffered.&quot; Four arms and four legs and four breasts, with their two heads side by side, clamoring for room in the crowded space between their barely broadened shoulders. You can&#39;t ignore your problems and take some time away from your partner if you are permanently fused together.  They were a walking argument.<br />
<br />
Mom took it the worst out of all of us.  She completely fused with my younger brother and became the dominant personality controlling the hermaphroditic body that is a perfect 50/50 blend of her aging motherly features and Tim&#39;s basketball-pro frame and build.  All of Tim&#39;s memories blended with hers, but unlike many fused people, a new personality wasn&#39;t created from the combination of both psyches.  It&#39;s just Mom, brought to the brink of tears whenever she looks at her face.  Though feminine, it&#39;s impossible not to pick out Tim&#39;s old features.<br />
<br />
As for me, I was just hating on my new humantaur body.  My coworker lost her head first thing when the Fusion Wave hit, and it ended up fusing onto her friend&#39;s stomach.  (I think they just got married a week before today.)  Anyways, her old body fell over, and I was just in the right place for it to fuse straight to my ass.  Her shoulders fused with my hips, and their arms locked into their new places of residence on either side of it, while my digestive and respiratory systems uncomfortably expanded as I writhed around on the ground.   I&#39;m not a very tall, and frankly not a very masculine guy, so with her body, which stood a whole foot and a half over me, attached to my former behind, her old cheeks were sticking damn near straight up in the air if I didn&#39;t bend my back knees.  I solved the problem by wearing special boots later on, but at the time it hurt like hell to walk, and I was too afraid and ashamed of the stares to go out in public.<br />
<br />
Nat didn&#39;t have to worry about the fear, shame, dysphoria, suffering, or anger that came with a new transformed body, and she didn&#39;t have to worry about loving or taking care of someone who did have one.<br />
<br />
No one, not even Nat, knew that the bastard was a transformation junkie . . . and a CTF fetishist.<br />
<br />
3 weeks after that family dinner, Nat had came home from work to find her apartment adorned in rose petals and a warm candlelight that led a trail into the bedroom.   Her bed was artfully surrounded with rose petals and candles, and covered in crimson sheets and pillows.  At its center sat Jay.<br />
The evening started out like any other spicy, steamy night of love-making when Jay asked my sister, with ragged breaths, if she was willing to do anal.  An odd request in hindsight as this was a first, but excited, giddy, and not yet spent, Nat obliged.  It was 5 minutes in that she realized that her glutes were fusing with her lover&#39;s hips.<br />
She began yelling, telling Jay that they had to either pull apart as soon as possible or sit completely still so to avert the &quot;sudden mutation,&quot; or let it work its course without any extreme changes.  Jay just kept pumping, whispering:<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry honey.  You&#39;re almost there.  We will be together forever.  Hardly a minute longer . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that my sister knew that there was something very, very wrong.<br />
Her shocked, quiet questioning grew into terrified screaming as her legs and arms rapidly atrophied and shrunk away into nothing, her hips fusing to Jay&#39;s crotch as veins began running up her gradually dwindling body.  She gasped, back arching, as her body flared with arousal and a sensation that was pleasurable only physically.  To her further shock, she found that she was stuck in this arched position, her body made rigid as it began in its entirety to throb.  Mouth forced agape, Nat did not hold back sobs and screams as hot tears ran down her cheeks and across her even hotter body, flushed and reddened, sweating all over.<br />
Jay licked his lips and brought his hands down to her sides as he began to rub in anticipation, while Nat&#39;s breasts migrated down to her former crotch to fuse with the unfurling folds of her labia as they formed into generously large testicles.<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes! YEEEEEEESSSS!!!&quot;, he had cried.  Any moment then, Nat&#39;s breastless, limbless torso would round out, and her face would warp into that of a mushroom, her mouth turned vertical into a urethra.  If he timed it right, he would orgasm with his new 3-foot member just as it would finish its transformation.<br />
<br />
But it stopped right then and there.</p>
