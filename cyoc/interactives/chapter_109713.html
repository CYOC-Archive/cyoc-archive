<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joseph was praying when his daughter entered in the hospital chapel. Smelling the scents of two other were’s with her; Joseph knew Samantha and his son Samson where also present.<br />
“Father,” Frances snaps; “what the hell is going on with mother?”<br />
“You tell me,” Joseph still silently praying.<br />
“Mother tried to overdose on the morphine for her pain,” Samson growling; “just as we came to visit her!”<br />
“She’s fine,” Frances snapping; “not that you seem to care. The doctors managed to stabilize her.”<br />
“I’ve always cared about your mother,” Joseph refusing to be baited in a fight; “it’s why I insisted she explore all options with her cancer before electing for surgery.”<br />
“If you cared for mother so much,” Frances snarling; “you wouldn’t have kicked me out after I came out of the closet!”<br />
“The bible states homosexuality as a sin,” Joseph’s anger rising; “if we were still living in the Amish community daughter, I would have had you shipped off to the church elders were they would of prayed and perform an exorcism to purge those sinful desires from you.”<br />
 “You mean have me re-programed,” Frances snorts; “I’ve seen the documentaries regarding the Amish father. Half the time, they act like a cult; the other time nothing more than brutish thugs similar to the mafia in New York.”<br />
“That’s what television wants you to believe,” Joseph sighing; “not every Amish man or woman acts like uncouth brutes.”<br />
“Bah,” Frances looking disgusted; “you know what you are father? A hypocrite; you claim to be devout in your beliefs, but have no qualms in using the modern conveniences that Amish shun. You claim to love mother so much? Then why is it I had to start chest compressions as Samson called for help? Did you not see Angelica pushing the button strapped to her left hand requesting Morphine from the I.V stand?”<br />
“I was here the entire time,” Joseph answering; “praying.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s go love,” Samantha speaking; “its clear Joseph will never change.”<br />
“Yeah,” Samson looking at his father; “will just have to have Christmas diner without him.”<br />
“What about mom,” Frances leaving with her wife and brother; “what about her joining us?”<br />
“I doubt mom will be well enough to join us,” Samson sighs; “physically or mentally.”<br />
As Frances, Samson and Samantha leave; Joseph opens his bible to look at a photo of Frances when she was six years old; “Lord, grant me the strength to seek and accept forgiveness. I miss my daughter.”<br />
<br />
Leaving the hospital, Samson drives back to Frances’s office; getting back into his police cruiser and Samantha in her car, Frances follows the two as they drive back to their house. While Samson pulled his cruiser onto the curb; Samantha and Frances pull into their snow covered driveway. Getting out of their cars; the crunch of snow as they walk to the door could be heard. With Samson following; Frances and Samantha enter an empty house.<br />
“Guess Ben is with Alex still,” Frances sighing.<br />
“We’ll have a simple salad for supper then,” Samantha answering.<br />
“Oh goodie,” Samson walking in; “rabbit food.”<br />
“Your more than welcome to head to your place an eat a microwaved burrito by yourself, “Samantha scolding.<br />
“I still might,” Samson smiling; “but sis shouldn’t be alone right now.”<br />
Frances smiles as she finds Ben’s beef jerky stash and tosses it to Samson; “that should hold you over. Just don’t tell Ben I know where he hides his jerky.”<br />
“He keeps it under a plastic plant,” Samson seeing where Frances grabbed it from.<br />
“Ben thinks I don’t know,” Frances leaning into whisper; “but now and then, I steal a strip or two when I’m craving more than just a salad or two.” Frances takes some jerky and eats some; leaving Samson to laugh as he gnaws on the rest while following his sister into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“So that’s the whole spiel,” Samantha talking about her day at work; Martin is going to resign as mayor to become the next Wer-mer rep.”<br />
“Andrew is retiring,” Frances looking surprised; “when?”<br />
“As soon as the issue regarding Benton Knight is resolved,” Samantha answering while looking at Frances; “you wouldn’t know when that would be would you?”<br />
“You know I can’t discuss my patients with you Samantha,” Frances answering; “I take doctor patient confidentiality very seriously.”<br />
“Hold on,” Samson looking shocked; “You’re treating Benton Knight? Moon Lake’s biggest bigot next to dad?”<br />
“It’s complicated,” Frances answering; “suffice to say it’s at the request of the elder council, brother.”<br />
“But won’t Martin Stovall being the Wer-mer rep,” Samson asking; be a conflict regarding Julie Stovall’s issues?”<br />
“Andrew stated,“ Samantha speaking; “that Tachibana wanted that matter settled promptly. I’m thinking there is an emergency session going on tonight or possibly starting tomorrow to handle the child’s Statue 1A charges.” <br />
“I wonder how long that will last,” Samson speaking out loud.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
“Miss Tachibana,” William speaking on his cell phone; “I was wondering if I could ask you some questions regarding tomorrow.”<br />
“I take it you know of the summons your son Eric was given earlier today?”<br />
“Eric showed me,” William answering why washing dishes; “Will Eric be missing the whole day of school for this?”<br />
“Yes,” Tachibana answering; “possibly Friday as well, It all depends on how long the statue 1A proceedings take.”<br />
“Eric has end of year exams before Christmas break,” William speaking; “I don’t want him to miss those.”<br />
“Which is why I’m pushing to have this issue regarding Julie Stovall dealt with quickly,” Tachibana answers.<br />
“Is Julie going to be present as well;” William speaking up.<br />
“She has to be,” Tachibana responds; “Julie needs to answer to the charges placed before her. But if you are worried she will be in the same room with Eric, than that answer is no. My Grandsons Daisuke and Yamoto are currently keeping an eye on the young wer-mermaid and will be chaperoning her as she waits for her turn to speak before the council.”<br />
“But Eric and Frieda,” William confirming; “will be in a separate room from Julie.”<br />
“Yes. But if it makes you feel any better,” Tachibana responding; I’ll try to push to have them testify first. But I can’t guarantee that it will allow them to leave early.”<br />
“It’s better than nothing,” William answers; “is there anything else I should know?”<br />
“Only that there is the possibility that this could drag on until Saturday,” Tachibana sighs; “it all depends on what strategy Julie’s lawyer might try.”<br />
“Hold on,” William remembering what Benton said earlier; “Benton said that my son would be speaking to the council only. No lawyers or family for moral support.”<br />
“Ah,” Tachibana sighs; “While Benton is correct with what he said; Julie does have the right for legal representation to speak on her behalf in the council chambers. Since with the exception of myself, the rest of the council will be acting as a form of a jury.”<br />
“Why are you not on the jury,” William asking?<br />
“As the oldest were on the council,” Tachibana stating; “I mediate and act as judge. Plus I cast the deciding vote in the event of a tie. Majority opinion rules.”<br />
“Okay,” William answers; “I guess that’s all for now. Will you let me know when this matter is resolved?”<br />
“I will personally call you the moment the trial is over,” Tachibana answers; “we’ll talk then.”<br />
<br />
William dries his paws as he hangs up; In his were-fox fursona he was doing the dishes while his wife was upstairs working on her lesson plans for tomorrow. Heading to the basement door and opening it quietly; William hears the sounds of three weres enjoying each other’s company in an intimate fashion. Closing the door to give them their privacy; William walks to the living room to watch television while waiting for his oldest son to come home.</p>
