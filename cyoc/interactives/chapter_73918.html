<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Will what work on me?&quot; Keri blurted out. They hadn't been in the car for five minutes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing.&quot; Daniel have been tying to force his mind off the topic the entire time. The topic of his wish. Of <br />
wishing. Damn. Banana coconut trees. He stared intently at the dashed lines in the road in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Banana Coconut what? What did you wish for?&quot; Keri felt her head annoyingly fill with -la-la-la-la- like a <br />
child was reciting something endlessly. She held her hands to her ears. &quot;Please stop. stop.&quot; It did.<br />
<br />
&quot;When that old man was telling his story, I wanted it to be true, but I didn't want any of this. I didn't want <br />
Brad to die.&quot; Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed her twinge a little at the mention of brad. &quot;I just <br />
wanted a chance, a way for girls to like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Daniel. You're a nice guy. Girls like you. Heck, I like you...&quot; her voice trailed off into recognition. <br />
&quot;Ohh. You didn't? Did you wish to make girls like you? Don't you use that on me.&quot; Her voice started stern, but <br />
oddly changed pitch as her sentence trailed off. &quot;Daniel.&quot; Her body shivered, as if something was running <br />
through her. <br />
<br />
When she spoke again, her voice was soft with closeness. &quot;Ohh, Daniel.&quot; She reached her hand over, gently <br />
placing it on his leg. He'd done it, and all he could think about now was her touch. &quot;Are you saying you like <br />
me?&quot; Of course he did. God, who didn't like her? She's totally nice and totally hot, the whole package. &quot;Ohh, <br />
that's so sweet. See, Brad never would have said that.&quot; <br />
<br />
In fairness, Daniel hadn't said it either. She had plucked it right out if his mind. He looked over at her, <br />
and her posture was totally different now. Her shoulders were facing him, at least as much as was possible in <br />
the confines of the front seat and seat-belt. Her blond hair perfectly cascading around her shoulders despite <br />
having just come from a wooded campsight and horrible afternoon ordeal. He also couldn't help but momentarily <br />
lust after a sliver of cleavage before darting his eyes back onto the road.<br />
<br />
Keri giggled, &quot;wow, I think I'm really going to like this telepathy thing. I always found it kind of rude when <br />
guys peeked there. But that was almost a compliment.&quot; Even silent, Daniel found himself mentally denying her <br />
implication. &quot;Ohh, you know where I mean. Yes. Exactly.&quot; Somehow with her leading pressure, he found it <br />
impossible not to let his mind think about her tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa there boy. Enough about me.&quot; She leaned in, rubbing her hand against his leg briefly. Between focusing <br />
on the road and her hand on his leg, his mind was fully occupied and quiet. &quot;There we go. We have a long drive <br />
home, just focus on the road.&quot; <br />
<br />
Daniel tried his best, but the more darkness descended, and the more her hand stroked against him, the more he <br />
couldn't think about anything else. It didn't help that the more he thought about her, the more she seemed to <br />
respond, occasionally moving her hand against him. <br />
<br />
The whole time she was silent, and he was letting his guard down, forgetting to keep his thoughts in check. <br />
Was it really working? Did she really like him? Eventually, he looked over at her. Seeing her in the dark, the <br />
eyes staring back at him seemed to answer the question. 'Yes. I want you, Daniel.' Her lips hadn't moved, but <br />
he immediately felt it inside him. Before he knew what happened, he felt something stirring in his pants. The <br />
same voice in his head followed coyly, 'oh, Daniel.'<br />
<br />
Her posture shifted, and her hand stirred against his thigh. It was more consistent now, rubbing, progressing <br />
inward. Had she noticed? Her stroke came close to brushing him and for a moment he felt distracted from the <br />
road. 'Why? Do you want me to?' It wasn't a voice. It was a concept, a thought, permeating him. Her fingers <br />
approached again, this time softly brushing up against his crotch and startling him. &quot;Keep your eyes on the <br />
road now mister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel's eyes were glued to the endless dotted center-line markers appearing out of the darkness. His <br />
thoughts, however, were largely on the feeling of Keri's fingers stroking his pants. He was in heaven, and <br />
each time he thought it couldn't get any better, it did. He'd only a few times had any intimate contact, and <br />
those were awkward moments with hardly attractive girls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You've never had a good hand job before?&quot; He wasn't sure how many of her words were spoken aloud as <br />
his mind answered her rhetorical question. Slowly, and with just one hand, Keri managed to unfasten the top <br />
few buttons of his pants. It was just enough to get her fingers in against his underwear, rubbing the head of <br />
his cock, 'we'll fix that tonight lover boy.'<br />
<br />
They were close to home now, but the last few miles seemed to drag on. A torturous pleasure.</p>
