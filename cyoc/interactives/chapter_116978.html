<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Without so much as a second thought to consider it any further, Jake was up and about. Only now, he was starting to realize how much work this going to be. Well, that&#39;s why there&#39;s a word called &#39;multitasking.&#39; Going over to his sink, he ran the hot water to get ready for washing his dishes. He tossed in a sponge for good measure with some dish soap. Next, it was off the bathroom to run water for a bucket so he could start moping. After all, he might as well if he was going to go all out.<br />
<br />
Oh, and he really should pick up some of his stray clothes and put them in the hamper... er, he did have a hamper, right?  There was on in the bathroom, he was looking right at it, but was that always there? It kinda felt a little out of place, but it must have just slipped his mind. No biggie.<br />
<br />
Jake was abuzz with activity now as he rushed about to clean everything he could, never noticing the slight changing happening around him... or to him for that matter.<br />
<br />
His rather plain apartment started to change from a dull yellow to a bright white with a black trimming going across the top of them. The mock wooden floors were now black marble that lead to a lush blue carpet that was signaled where the living room was. In fact, his old couch went from an old red spring to a black leather one with several lovely throw pillows on it.  Wiping down his counter-tops replaced them as well. The same for his stove and fridge, each becoming shiny and new.<br />
<br />
Before long, even his bathroom had become a sparkling example of what to want out of, well, every bathroom. A massive jet tub and a rain style shower over head. It was beautiful.<br />
<br />
And as Jake cleaned, he changed as well. His fingers became hard and thick, his arms became a lot more tone than he recalled at first before shrugging it off and he could have sworn he was taller now. But that was just silly. His legs had become slender, covered in short fur and were now digi-grade, ending in black hooves. His hips had flared out greatly to make his new rather enlarged backside that keep jiggling behind him. <br />
<br />
It would have been distracting if not for his new, silvery tail which almost made him panic before thinking, &#39;Didn&#39;t I always have a tail?&#39; and just like that, it was dismissed. It just seemed to balance his lower body out just right, especially when he skipped around. His waist narrowed nicely into a hourglass figure making the swaying of the hips become even more natural. And before long, his rather flat chest started to expand.<br />
<br />
And expand.<br />
<br />
And expand.<br />
<br />
Nice, big breasts. That was normal for a mare of her age, right? Oh sure, they were a little... gravity deifying thanks to surgery, but hey, solid E cups were well worth it. <br />
<br />
A moment of pause came over Jake. Mare? Her? Where did that come from? Why was he... questioning it, actually? Of course she was a mare, the tail, hooves, and mane were a dead give away. She had to giggle a little at the odd thought. Oh well. Speaking of which, she really should check her hair.<br />
<br />
Going into her bathroom, Jake- wait... that wasn&#39;t her name! Such a silly mare. No no, Onyx went into her her bathroom to do a quick checkup. Sure enough, in the medicine cabinet mirror looking back at her was a gorgeous black mare with a silver mane with the brightest blue eyes. So would call her vain, but hey, after years of beating herself up over her physical appearance, she could afford to like how she looked.<br />
<br />
She did a little prance in the mirror, looking at herself from head to hoof. Her blue short shorts were just perfect for showing off her bubble butt! And her old white t-shirt might have seen better day with how strained it was to hold in all this mare, but Onyx couldn&#39;t bare to throw it out. It was her favorite after all. Poking out her bathroom, she checked the time, three hours sure did go by quick, fast, and in a hurry!<br />
<br />
Going back over to her little black coffee table where she set the card from earlier she read it once more:<br />
<br />
&quot;To my darling Onyx,<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve been watching you for so long and I can&#39;t stand to wait any longer. This is my gift to you, my forbidden love. And this is my symbol of affection for you alone. I&#39;ll be seeing you soon~<br />
<br />
With love,<br />
XoXo&quot;<br />
<br />
Onyx sighed to herself as she hugged the card to her chest tightly. Oh, who could it be? Maybe it was a well hung stud who&#39;s been checking her out when she goes for a run in the park? Or maybe it&#39;s a sexy little kitty looking to cuddle up to a big, strong, slutty mare? She always did like cats...But she hated the suspense! She wanted to know who this mystery crush was! If there just a clue...<br />
<br />
Looking at the card one more time, she moved her thumb to read it better at one point to see something that made her heart jump. A time. Eight o&#39; clock.<br />
<br />
Her eyes darting up to see the time, she had one hour to go! Onyx nearly squealed with glee as she bounced up and down. Should she shower? Or maybe she should start cooking? Or maybe... oh, this going to be the greatest night of her life!</p>
