<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking in the hallway towards the cafeteria, you told Dominic that you will stop by the bathroom and that he does not have to wait for you. After Dominic waved good-bye for the time being, you headed for the nearest bathroom. You thought that this would be the best place to be while you continue to probe into this new situation. At least no one should bother your comatose body while you were away. When you entered the nearest bathroom, you were relieved to find it completely vacant, as most students were heading for lunch. Heading for the furthest stall, you locked the door, hung your backpack, and sat on the lowered toilet seat cover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, this should be fine. Now how do I start this...?&quot;<br />
<br />
You let your mind wander, similar to the last two instances. Inevitably, you began to revisit the conversation between Coach Lucas and Evander. You pondered if Coach Lucas would serve as a good model for your adult life. He was strong and caring, and it&#39;s no wonder many people in the school liked him from the start, such as Evander. &quot;How do I get people to like me, to see me as a responsible adult?&quot; you thought as you begin to drift off once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cough cough.&quot; You woke up to choking sounds. Opening your eyes, you noticed that you were now sitting at a table in the teacher&#39;s lounge. Immediately, you realized that you were the one choking, as your left hand is covering over your mouth. Quickly scanning the table, you found a tumbler nearby. Picking it up, you were relieved to find fluid inside, so you opened the tumbler and drank from it to stop the choke.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the choking abated after a couple of drinks. You took a couple deep breaths as you survey your new surroundings. You were definitely in the teacher&#39;s lounge, given the open dining table and small kitchen space in the far corner. On the table right in front of you lies a partially eaten bowl of salad, an apple, and the tumbler. Presumably, your current host was enjoying lunch right when you &#39;intruded&#39;. It seems that no one else was in the lounge, which would give you time to figure things out. This would prove to be crucial as the list of surprises begins here.<br />
<br />
At first, you remarked that the lunch was pretty bland, as you tend to enjoy a bigger portion. However, you quickly notice the grey watch wrapped around your wrist. Likewise, your hands look different, a bit bigger with much longer and slender fingers. You rubbed the watch as if you were hallucinating, but you quickly feel the coldness of the metal. You then pushed back slightly from the table to inspect the rest of your new body. As you observe your new clothing and figure, you immediately realized that you were now in Mr. Evander Wright&#39;s body. You were adorning the same attire as you saw before, from the royal blue blazer to the black dress shoes and everything in between. Standing in disbelief, you could feel the new power Evander’s fit body gave you and felt weird sensations all over your body from the recent muscle gain. You first reach for your chest, grasping those pectorals that actually look bigger from this point of view. The touch sent a small wave of pleasure through the body, which immediately took you by surprise, causing you to stop. You thought, &quot;So I have pecs now...&quot; before you slowly bent over slightly to observe beyond your chest. Similar to your previous hosts, there was something you immediately wanted to check on. You dig a hand to your crotch to confirm the new length and width of your junk. Despite not being able to press fully into the groin due to the tight dress pants, your questions were answered as you exclaimed, &quot;It&#39;s average. It still feels longer and thicker than mine though. This is so weird.&quot; You also noticed your voice, while still sounding masculine, it was higher pitched than your dad’s or Coach Lucas’s. In fact, it sounded even higher pitched than your old voice, adding to your long list of novelties in this experience.<br />
<br />
Of course, not all changes were unwelcoming. Being in two burly men previously, you found yourself enjoying the new sensation of being light and svelte. You began rubbing your slim legs up and down, appreciating the feeling of cotton on your hands and the muscle definition on your legs. You notice that you seem to lack a lot of body hair, and any that you do see is nearly nonexistent due to it being the same light shade of blonde that was on your head. Your skin is also very smooth and soft, which is similar to your original skin. Taking a few steps, you were surprised that you adapted to walking quite nicely at your new height. Despite being shorter than your dad and Coach Lucas, Evander still stood at a decent height of 6 feet, the heels of his dress shoes adding to his stature in spite of them being relatively short. You find you rather like the dress shoes compared to your usual sneakers, even if they felt a little tight. Also, you also adore the sound of the heels clicking on the hard floor, which reminded you of professionalism. Even though you preferred brawny and beefy men, you slowly warmed up to your new body because of the novel experience. It is not like you can experience how a twunk lives on a typical day, and if you had this power to begin with, you might as well use it to its full potential.<br />
<br />
All this exploration must have made your body hungry, as you hear your stomach growl. You sat yourself back in the chair and grabbed the salad bowl before beginning to eat the remainder of Evan’s lunch. Despite your previous complaint, you found yourself enjoying this, and you felt full after finishing the salad and the apple. Finishing it off with the rest of the liquid in the tumbler, which was green tea, was a nice end to it all. Very different, but very pleasant. You tossed the trash into the bin and headed to the teacher&#39;s office, where you figured you would find Evan’s belongings.<br />
<br />
You were surprised to find the teacher&#39;s office empty, but a posted note about a faculty meeting in the administrative office answered your question. Presumably, only the senior members of the faculty needed to attend, as Evan obviously didn&#39;t need to be there. You guessed that the other young faculty members just happen to be teaching, as the lunch period was staggered among the school population. Using your persistent luck, you scanned across tables to find something that indicated Evan’s stuff. In the far corner lie his utensils, papers, and messenger bag, the latter of which you were able to identify due to the smell of cologne emanating from the bag matching the scent from your body.<br />
<br />
Scouring the table for a schedule, you found that Evan has to teach two periods of English in the afternoon. Glancing at your wristwatch, in the same manner as Evan did, you realized that there are 15 more minutes before the next period starts. You quickly recognized a couple of issues at hand. You were not as proficient in English as you were in math, so you weren&#39;t sure how to teach if you had to teach. You also had to deal with your personal situation, as you technically still have two more classes in the afternoon. At first, you thought about returning to your body, but you hadn&#39;t figure that out yet. Not wanting to pin your hopes in one direction, you thought about other actions you could take just in case you remain in Evan’s body for a while longer. After all, you were in Coach Lucas&#39;s body for an hour and a half. (Subconsciously, you also wished to enjoy this new body for just a bit longer.) But should you take care of Evan’s teaching or your own situation first?</p>
