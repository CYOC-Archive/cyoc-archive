<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stared at her outstretched hand, frowning. <br />
<br />
I guess...a part of me felt like Ava at the very least was trying to be truthful with me. That she was being earnest in her own way. But she still worked for whatever this organization was. Some branch of the military or government or whatever. She was giving me a choice, but how much of a choice was there, really? In my current state, I really was...dangerous. It was an odd thought. But kinda true, right? <br />
<br />
No upper limit to my growth? That was...I mean, it had been hard enough to try and comprehend tits large enough that I couldn&#39;t even stand up. Everything after that was just a constant series of defying reality. But...how big could they get? There had to be some kind of a limit right? They wouldn&#39;t just...keep going. <br />
<br />
Either way, I&#39;d have to try and hope to find a way to control this.<br />
<br />
But I also didn&#39;t like the idea of working with these assholes either. Sure, Ava was in here, trying to make peace with me. But the organization she was working for had stuck me in here, taken away all my stuff, kept me from contacting anyone on the outside, refused to tell me any information, and had spent the past couple days essentially torturing - supposedly to see if they could figure out how to suppress my growth, but I didn&#39;t really have any proof of that.<br />
<br />
Shit, who knew what the government really wanted. What if they just wanted to figure out how to recreate the Breastinator? If it really had been destroyed while restoring me, then maybe they just wanted to keep me around long enough to try and recreate it. Maybe they didn&#39;t have any intentions of letting me go.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
I could at least play along. For now. Right? Better to seem agreeable for now, but keep my eyes open. Try to get control of this - real control, MY control, not theirs. <br />
<br />
Not that I had any idea where to start.<br />
<br />
Ava was waiting patiently, hand still outstretched. <br />
<br />
I slowly reached out and shook on it. &quot;For now,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good enough,&quot; she said. &quot;Thanks Bronwyn.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded slightly. &quot;Can I get a fucking shirt now?&quot;<br />
<br />
She held up her hands. &quot;Yeah...look. I&#39;m sorry about that. We&#39;ve requested additional material. You kinda...we don&#39;t have any spares.&quot;<br />
<br />
I let out a snort of a laugh. &quot;...Yeah, alright, fair enough,&quot; I muttered. &quot;I&#39;m tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get some rest. We&#39;re - we&#39;ll have to keep doing tests, okay? There has to be a way to suppress the triggers that cause the growth - but in order to find them, we have to keep triggering it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed, closing my eyes. &quot;Yeah, I got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She put a hand on my shoulder briefly, and then stood up and left the room.<br />
<br />
I laid back on my cot, staring up at the florescent lights. <br />
<br />
What an odd turn my life had taken.<br />
<br />
Maybe it would work out - maybe they would help me for real and I could get control of this. <br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
I woke up a few hours later with an odd itching sensation on my chest. I frowned and looked down at my chest, blinking slightly. They dimmed the lights somewhat when I slept, but they never fully went out. This was new. They&#39;d never really itched like that before. Grumbling under my breath, I reached out to itch them--<br />
<br />
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!<br />
<br />
A massive burst of pleasure suddenly flooded my body, making me let out a high pitched squeal of delight. Almost instantly my breasts surged forward a bit, going from flat to about...shit, I don&#39;t know, I didn&#39;t have a tape measure...maybe a B-cup or so? And holy fuck, that had...that had been intense. My heart was pounding slightly in the aftermath of it, and I could feel a dampness in the panties. <br />
<br />
The sort of itching/tingling in my breasts hadn&#39;t gone away either. Well, no way in hell I was going to feel them up again. <br />
<br />
I did my best to ignore it, and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
I ended up having a pretty intense dream after that. A pretty good intense dream. In it, I found myself in a bedroom, wearing only lingerie. I looked around with a mild sort of curiosity, before I realized that Ashley was in there too. She walked up to me, and pushed me up against one of the banisters of the bed, kissing me intently, sending a flood of desire rushing through my body. Smirking slightly at me, she maneuvered me onto the bed, and began to undress in front of me, before resting herself on top of my body, kissing every inch of my body. My breathing grew rapid as her kisses went lower, and I could feel her hand grasp the edge of my panties--<br />
<br />
A screeching alarm jerked me awake, causing me to sit up and flail a bit.<br />
<br />
Two things quickly became apparent. The lights above were flashing as part of the alarm, and the tingling in my chest was still there.<br />
<br />
My heart rate spiked and I felt the growth surge begin. I growled in annoyance, and then wrenched my eyes shut and took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
The alarm died off and the lights stopped flashing - to my great surprise, I was able to stop the growth before they got much larger than my torso. The weight was still enough to make my back hurt though, and cause the tingling to get a bit more intense. It was hard to resist touching them. <br />
<br />
I looked up at the camera. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I go back to sleep now?&quot; I asked testily. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; came the curt response. &quot;Stay awake until the growth has regressed fully.&quot;<br />
<br />
I let out a sigh. Too bad. I would&#39;ve liked to have returned to that dream. I hoped Ashley was okay. It was a sobering thought. Who knew how many people might&#39;ve been hurt...or worse...because of me. Because of my boobs. <br />
<br />
The growth went down slowly over time, but it did go down. I had a boring lunch of chicken soup and water - yum yum.<br />
<br />
But eventually, I realized they had stopped shrinking. But they hadn&#39;t gone down all the way. I frowned, looking down at them. They were the same size they had been the previous night, after I&#39;d touched myself. That was...probably not great, was it? Maybe it was just some side effect. Or maybe they were doing this to me on purpose to try and elicit an emotional response or something. Who the fuck knew with these people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand with your back against the wall, please,&quot; came the voice on the intercom. <br />
<br />
I let out a sigh and slammed my back up against the wall. And waited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your emotional state is normalized,&quot; came the voice. &quot;But your growth hasn&#39;t receded fully. Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me,&quot; I told the voice, holding out my hands. &quot;That&#39;s your job, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
No response. Whatever.<br />
<br />
I went back to the cot and settled down, facing away from the mirror. Fuck this place, fuck these people, fuck this whole situation. <br />
<br />
I just want to go back to normal.<br />
<br />
Is that really too much to ask?<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Apparently - the answer to that question was a resounding yes.<br />
<br />
Because a few hours later, I was once again yanked out from my sleep. The tingling and itching had gotten more intense. A lot more intense. I let out a gasp and reached down, grasping them in my hands without even thinking about it. <br />
<br />
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shitshitshitshitshit YES. SHIT. That felt...wow. <br />
<br />
Wow! That was...cloud nine...but...oh. <br />
<br />
Oh...<br />
<br />
...Oh shit.<br />
<br />
Yeah. Okay.<br />
<br />
So.<br />
<br />
I just had a super intense orgasm because I grabbed my breasts.<br />
<br />
And because of that, they doubled in size - maybe a bit more. <br />
<br />
And the tingling is still there.<br />
<br />
Oh shit. <br />
<br />
Uhh...shit??<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know what to do. I&#39;m - I&#39;m almost afraid to move. What if it makes the tingling worse? What&#39;s causing this? Are they doing this to me??<br />
<br />
The lights suddenly snap on to full intensity. &quot;Your heart rate is elevated and your breast size has increased! What have you been doing?&quot; the voice on the intercom demands. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t - I wasn&#39;t -&quot; I protest, sitting up and wincing at the depressingly familiar sense of weight on my chest. &quot;I didn&#39;t do it on purpose!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was - they were itching, so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You see? That&#39;s it? What the fuck is that?!&quot; I demand. &quot;You&#39;re probably doing this to me, aren&#39;t you?! What the fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#39;s a hissing noise. They&#39;re releasing the knockout gas again!<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; I shout again. My head begins to feel dizzy. &quot;Fuck...&quot; I started to say.<br />
<br />
And then I&#39;m gone.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
When I wake up again, I&#39;ve been strapped down to the cot, and several scientist looking people are standing over me, taking blood samples. I let out a cry of protest, but can&#39;t do much from my current position. They ignore me, and take their samples, and leave. The restraints release themselves and I stagger to my feet.<br />
<br />
My breasts are still the size they were when I was knocked out.<br />
<br />
Not good. So not good. Fucking shit. Right when I was getting some kind of control...or at least...it felt like it. <br />
<br />
And the tingling is still there!<br />
<br />
Shit....<br />
<br />
I let out a whimper, feeling my legs go weak from the sensations. <br />
<br />
Almost of their own volition, my hands go up to my breasts, rubbing away. I can&#39;t - I can&#39;t stop myself. It feels too good. It feels - it&#39;s the best feeling. Like...complete and utter bliss. Wow...<br />
<br />
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh god.....that feels....that feels so......oh man.......SHIIIIIIT. Holy fuck. That was....oh no, oh no, another one...another...SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!<br />
<br />
My breasts begin to surge forward.<br />
<br />
An alarm begins to blare in my cell. &quot;Cease this activity at once!&quot; the voice snaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I-I c-can&#39;t...&quot; I chatter through my teeth. <br />
<br />
It feels too good. Even now, I&#39;m still rubbing at them. I can feel the warmth spreading through my body, drenching my panties and sending a fresh new surge of growth through my boobs. They&#39;re beginning to bloat up now, heavy enough that I have to lean my weight forward a bit so I can comfortably rest on them. And as they get bigger, the tingling gets more intense. And now, just the sensations of the growth is enough to stimulate them. The pleasure is on a constant loop, reducing me to a quivering mess atop my billowing breasts, spreading out across the concrete floor.<br />
<br />
The hissing picks up once more. The dizziness comes...<br />
<br />
...I must pass out. But it&#39;s not for long.<br />
<br />
And when I open my eyes, the alarm is still blaring.<br />
<br />
The lights are flashing.<br />
<br />
And my tits are still getting bigger. As I come to, I gasp and look down to see that I&#39;ve been lifted up on them entirely and have started to rise towards the ceiling. I can feel them growing more and more, crawling up the cold concrete walls. The florescent lights are getting closer - I&#39;m having horrible flashbacks of outgrowing my own room...<br />
<br />
&quot;EMERGENCY ALERT,&quot; a voice sounds. &quot;ALL HANDS - EVACUATE.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;E-evacuate?&quot; I gasp, hardly able to speak around the constant pleasure my breasts are sending through me. &quot;You...you fucks...you&#39;re supposed...to help...&quot;<br />
<br />
And then I feel my back make contact with something cold, and realize I&#39;m about to fill up my cell. Either I&#39;m about to die...or I&#39;m about to have one hell of a prison break. <br />
<br />
Shit...last time I&#39;d almost destroyed half my city...</p>
