<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake had picked the enormous size 15 flip-flops. The word surfer was printed along the sole of the blue rubber. Jake looked at the <br />
gargantuan flip-flops, wondering why he was drawn to them in the first place, especially considering they were 6 sizes too big for him.<br />
<br />
The more Jake looked at the large rubber slabs, the more compelled he felt to wear them. He kicked off his trainers and socks to reveal <br />
his pale, average size 9's. He stepped into the flip-flops, noticing how much larger they were than his own feet. Jake felt a chill run up his <br />
spine, he turned his head to find the source of the draft... He couldn't see anywhere where a breeze might enter. He turned back, and <br />
gasped, to his shock his shirt had completely disappeared and his jeans had been replaced with a pair of oversized board shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the he- whoa...&quot; Jake uttered, a jolt of energy running through his whole body.<br />
He felt a strange pulling sensation as his spine began to lengthen, his torso stretched higher, his arms began to lengthen to suit his new <br />
height, his forearms stretching out, upper arms becoming longer. His legs groaned as his shins and thighs inched higher and higher, <br />
pulling Jake upwards to an final enormous 6'4&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, I'm so tall!&quot; he gasped to himself.<br />
<br />
Jake rubbed his flat stomach as it began to tingle and ache in a way he had never felt before, a pushing and pulling sensation. He grunted <br />
as he watched in horror, his stomach tightening and pushing, a rock hard set of washboard abs forming on his previously unremarkable <br />
stomach. &quot;Oh my god!&quot;, he watched a much sought-ater v-shape bein to form on his waist as pecs began to force their way out of his bony <br />
chest, he could feel the muscle swelling and expanding within them becoming well toned slabs of muscle. The hair coating his stomach <br />
and parts of his chest began to retract, almost tickling as it vanished into the skin. The hair across his body followed, his legs, arms; he <br />
pryed open the board shorts to see that his pubic hair now looked shaved.<br />
<br />
Jake let out a grunt as he felt his neck begin to thicken and strengthen, his shoulders began to balloon outwards, his back clicking and <br />
popping as it continued its expansion outwards, he could feel muscles growing and expanding across his once thin back. His biceps and <br />
triceps thickened and exploded with trim, toned muscle, his forearms began to follow, growing, expanding. Veins crossed their way across <br />
the backs of his hands, his fingers felt as if they were being stretched as they grew longer, more nimble and large, lengthening and <br />
thickening. His palms stretched alongside, broadening and lengthening. Leaving him with enormous hands, larger than he had ever seen, <br />
strong, manly hands.<br />
<br />
His thighs began their expansion, Jake almost fell as he felt the muscles contract and expand, his thighs quickly swelling to suit the huge <br />
board shorts he had on. His calves followed, tightening, becoming lean, powerful machines for running and swimming. His feet were next, <br />
his toes were pulled by an invisible force, growing longer, thickening, his soles pushed forwards, size 10, 11, 12... His feet broadened as <br />
they grew, the toes still expanding, size 13, 14... His soles inched out longer and longer... Size 15. Jake looked down at his new boats, he <br />
couldn't remember ever having seen such enormous feet in his life, and he loved it. He felt parts of his mind become fuzzy, rewiring, <br />
changing his personality,  &quot;Fuck yeah, massive feet, more for guys to sniff!&quot; he thought, &quot;Wait, I've never been into feet before... But, fuck <br />
they need worshipping.&quot; <br />
<br />
He felt his jaw begin to crack and pop as it shifted shape, his jawline smoothing and sharpening, his nose growing slightly larger, <br />
flattening, his ears shrinking slightly. He felt his hair straighten and lengthen into a medium length cut. In the mirror in front of him he saw a <br />
completely unfamiliar face, he couldn't believe it was him, he looked like a model.<br />
<br />
Finally he felt a warmth in his crotch as his balls began to rapidly swell, filling with hormones and semen. &quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Jake moaned, his <br />
hard 6 incher began to reel out longer and longer, thickening outwards as it went. Veins ran across the expanding shaft as it pulsed <br />
outwards, larger and larger. Jake couldn't contain himself &quot;Oh fuck yes!&quot; he moaned out. 7, 8 inches... He felt his foreskin tighten as the <br />
head of his cock ballooned outwards, 9 inches. Jake yelped out as his cock launched his new hot, thick surfer cream all over the mirror.<br />
<br />
He panted, looking at himself, posing, loving his new body. He looked down and wiggled his huge toes, knowing that his feet had now <br />
been imbued with the ability to make more sexy, big surfers with foot fetishes to match. He left the store, deciding to...</p>
