<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">          It was not a transformation of your own body at first but of the surroundings and the moth void around you. Nothingness turned into stone and earth. You felt the environment around you swell forming into a new structure around you.<br />
<br />
     Finally you found yourself in a strange doorless room. You looked around, and felt a strange empty air around your body, you looked down and saw that your clothes had completely vanished! No trace of them was  anywhere and you felt the cold air around you reflexively giving you a small boner to your average sized dick.<br />
<br />
                 Suddenly you clutched your chest as you felt a immense stinging sensation in your chest. You gasped for air as a igniting fire spread throughout your entire body, choking as the pain grew to every fingertip. You wanted to scream as the pain intentified as you felt something similar to your heart being torn into two pieces.<br />
<br />
    The pain started dying down as you felt something moving through your chest. Looking down, a small glowing red orb with the texture of blood phase out of your chest. Took confused and scared to speak you watch as the blood orb hovered to the center of the room and began shifting and contorting. Blood became flesh and muscles, bones and bloodied appendages started growing out to to the floor and walls, and started almost attaching themselves to the cold stone. You felt every second of this process. As the blood orb grew you too felt an expansion of sense as well. You felt as the newly formed flesh began to grow at the center maximizing to the size of a large horse in the room. You felt the strange feeling as the flesh itself began intergratinv with the inorganic stone. To finish off the transformation you watched in horror and disgust as the fleshy orb in the center now suspended by it&#39;s flesh tentacles midair formed one single giant eye. The eye was a dark purple and as it formed you saw it&#39;s new pupil adjust and started to focus on your naked body in front of it.<br />
(By the way you don&#39;t have a boner now.)<br />
Interestingly your own sense of sight increased as well. You were seeing YOURSELF through the flesh eye! It was an odd experience having a third eye which you could see through and your brain took a minute or so to adjust itself to the new line of sight.<br />
<br />
             You eventually found that you could control this new gigantic eye as well as your own eye being able to close it using a very bloodied eye lid and roll it around.<br />
<br />
             Deep within the giant eye itself you could also feel a deep beat happening inside it. It seems as if there wasn&#39;t just an eye taking up the space. You could feel everything the flesh eye felt and you felt the rhythmic thump of a large heart deep within its core. Incredible.<br />
<br />
         &quot;Incredible it is Felran.&quot; a deep booming voice came within your head. You look around trying to find the voice, both scared and hopeful.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Hello? Who is it?&quot; You ask out loud.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Felran I exist within your mind. But I also exist wishing the Dungeon&#39;s Heart.&quot; <br />
<br />
   You stand frozen unsure if what you heard was true. Considering the fact that you just teleported into a strange room with a fleshy organ system in the middle of it you figured it couldn&#39;t be that unusual. But what is the Dungeon&#39;s Heart? What happened? Where are you right now?<br />
<br />
      &quot;Worry not Felran, you are in confusion but let me destroy the mist that clouds the answers you seek.&quot; The voice booms, almost making you try and plug in your ears to try and make it quieter.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ah, sorry about that, I was just born so do forgive me. You see Felran let me explain.&quot; The voice says, much more quieter. &quot;The Dungeon Heart is the &quot;flesh eye&quot; as you do call it. As it is named it is both my very core and the core of the Dungeon. You see Felran, the nectar you drank was a special mixture made long ago by a demonic sorcerer who wanted power. Mixed with the blood of a dragon and infused with enough knowledge that you could write over twenty thousand books with it along with demonic magic he created a special liquid that would grant One power , however his plans were quickly found out by a group of mages and was killed his liquid found and kept within a special chamber which was the one you had found after being chased by that idiotic brute of a football player.&quot;<br />
<br />
      You tried processing this information but none of it made any sense at all. What about the other doors? What about yourself? How is this a dungeon?<br />
<br />
    &quot;You have many questions indeed Felran, I will continue to explain. You see, beyond the worlds of humans there exist other planes of existences as well. One more recognizable like Heaven and Hell along with lesser known ones like the world of Prima. <br />
<br />
         They are all fundamentally different with one common similarity. Dungeons. You see the room you currently reside in is your own Dungeon, the Dungeon Heart being it&#39;s very core. You see the liquid you drank allowed you to create your own Dungeon, splitting your soul in half in order to create it. If you Dungeon Heart were to die it would be essentially be the same as losing all of your limbs and half your organs, so do make sure to protect it.<br />
<br />
     Now what is a Dungeon you might ask. A Dungeon is a miniature realm between the spaces between worlds. It is a structural manifestation of your very soul and the larger your dungeon the more magical power you have. The Dungeon Heart is like you thought before, an organ system. It with your aid manages the dungeon along with storing a majority of your magical power. Using magical power you can expand your dungeon and grow in strength. To grow in strength however is to consume the souls of others. By consuming a soul, you absorb everything from that person. Their memories, their body, and their magical power that their soul produces as well. Your dungeon heart can produce magical power on it&#39;s own  as well though it would take centuries before you would be able to do anything with it.<br />
<br />
         Currently your Dungeon consists of only one room, but right now there is a door that leads into the mortal world, your world. To grow in power you must seek out other souls and consume them. However be wary for once you begin gaining power you will attract the attention of other Dungeon Masters whether they be demons, angels, or even gods. They tend to stick by a moral code as sort and usually only hinted certain targets. Demons usually carefree and eat what ever soul they can get their hands on while angels only targeted the souls of people who have committed crimes. There are also some who instead of hunting souls by themselves, instead raid the dungeons of other Dungeon Masters in an effort to absorb the crystal heart and steal their magical power instead.&quot; The Voice finally finishing.<br />
<br />
       Your head swam at all the information you learned. Angels? Dungeons? Other Worlds? Eating Souls?!? This was too much. <br />
<br />
        The voice heartily laughed at you in small amusement at your confusion. This prompted your next question.<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
   &quot;That is simple, I am simply the process of your soul splitting into two. I am esstentially the Dungeon Heart you see before you as well as being a separate mind from yourself. Despite this we share the same soul and if you were to die I would to die as well, so you can see why I want to be on your good side. By the way your True Name is Felran and any magic users would immediately call you that, Felran is your real name, the name given to you during birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
   &quot;Now go off Felran, you must go now and attain souls for us to grow!&quot;</p>
