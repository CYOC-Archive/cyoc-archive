<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay was floating in the water at the beach, awkwardly holding onto an unfamiliar surfboard.  Things had been a little awkward with his best friend Jeff this past week after he had completely messed things up, so when some of his other friends had invited him to hang out at the beach he had been eager to come out and de-stress.  Of course then Liam had offered to teach him how to surf, and now here he was out in the water as the rest of his friends looked on from the shore laughing at his amateur attempts to catch a wave.<br />
<br />
“Come on, this one looks good!” Liam called out encouragingly from nearby, comfortably astride his own board as he gestured towards a newly forming wave.  “Just do what I showed you and you’ll be fine!  You got this Brown!”<br />
<br />
“O… Okay!” Jay called back nervously as Liam responded with a double thumbs up.  He hadn’t been having much success yet, the few waves he had caught so far he hadn’t even managed to stand up on the board Liam had lent him before wiping out.<br />
<br />
Still, he had been slowly getting a feel for it and he was determined that this time he would finally look cool in front of his friends watching on from the shoreline.  Or at least not make a fool of himself.  He angled himself up with the wave as it approach him… and… yes!  He was in!  This one felt different, with a swift movement Jay was on his feet crouched on the board as the wave carried him forwards.<br />
<br />
“I did it!  Yes!” Jay called out triumphantly,  surprising steady on his feet, he glanced towards Liam who was cheering at his first real success.<br />
<br />
Jay felt a wave of pride at his accomplishment swell from within him.  Then it shifted, suddenly feeling as though an intense hot flush was spreading rapidly across his whole body.  He blinked in confusion at the strange sensation as he started to feel a little dizzy.  And that was enough of a distraction.  His concentration broke, and with it his tenuous balance on the board failed and Jay overbalanced coming crashing out of the wave and into the water.<br />
<br />
Jay, still dizzy and flustered, cursed himself in his mind as he fumbled blindly in the turbulent water.  His eyes remained firmly clamped shut, having never been able to will himself to open them underwater.  However moments later a lifeline appeared in the form of a sharp tug on his ankle from the cord of his wayward surfboard pulling him in the direction of the surface.<br />
<br />
Jay oriented himself upwards and swam.  The feeling of heat and dizziness had yet to fade, if anything it was growing stronger.  He was almost there.  His hand broke the surface, feeling the fresh air.  Then suddenly everything shifted.<br />
<br />
Jay was overwhelmed by the sudden and instantaneous change in his sensations.  It was like the water around him had suddenly solidified into a hot dense mass of flesh, oppressively pushing in on him from all angles.  He… he couldn’t move.  He couldn’t feel his arm at the surface anymore.  Actually he couldn’t feel either of his arms, or his legs for that matter.  Every signal from his body was a confusing mismatch tactile sensations.<br />
<br />
‘Wha- what the hell is happening?!’ Jay thought to himself as the strangeness of the situation gave way to panic.<br />
<br />
‘And,’ he continued, desperately trying to suppress the urge to gag ‘what the fuck is that horrible taste?!’<br />
<br />
Seriously, it felt like he had shoved his head in a truck stop toilet and taken a deep swig of water.  The taste was revolting, threefold worse than even that nightmarish vision, and he could feel it running deeply down the length of his throat.  He wanted nothing more than to cough his guts up and take a deep breath of air.<br />
<br />
A deep breath… <br />
<br />
He needed to breathe!  Whatever was happening didn’t matter, he had to get to the surface!  It felt as though it had been a minute already and he had no idea how much longer he could hold his breath.  Instinct took over and Jay forced his eyes open to find the way forward.  <br />
<br />
It was pitch black.  <br />
<br />
Jay was in total darkness, as though completely bind.  He opened and closed his eyes and nothing changed, his vision equally dark in either state.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jay’s attention snapped away as a muffled male voice cursed nearby.<br />
<br />
“Damn it! What the hell?” The distorted, but somehow familiar, voice emphatically stated in frustration.  “Did it work? What happened?”<br />
<br />
‘Was that Liam?’ Jay desperately thought to himself, it had to be.  The voice didn’t sound quite right but it was the only thing that made sense.  Now that Jay was aware of the voice he could hear it continue to speak more faintly but he couldn’t make out what it said this time.<br />
<br />
There was no time left, Jay knew he needed to breathe.  Summing up his courage he tried to call out to get the guys attention.  His mouth was clamped shut.  Jay was confused, he tried again more forcefully.  There was some give.  Again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly his whole body shifted ever so slightly as the oppressive flesh-like prison around him moved in place, carrying him with it.  The pressure from all sides abated just enough and Jay felt his mouth loosen, he called out with the last of his breath.<br />
<br />
What came forth was not his voice, but an immense full body belch that vibrated along the length of his body.  It was vile, the taste and smell of it was like something straight out of a guys arse.  He gaged as the intense sensation lingered around him, only serving to expel a second smaller belch in his debilitated state.  <br />
<br />
Then as quickly as it had started Jay felt his mouth clench shut against his will once more, the crushing pressure of the fleshy prison reasserting itself again in full.  He had failed.  Nobody was coming.  He was out of breath and about to pass out.  Any moment now…<br />
<br />
?<br />
<br />
He… was fine?  He couldn’t breathe, but… somehow he… didn’t need to?<br />
<br />
Nothing made sense, was he dead?  What the hell had happening to him?  With the immediate fear of death now put on hold Jay turned his mind to feeling out his situation.  His whole body was fucked, the only thing he could clearly feel was his mouth and throat.  He couldn’t move, he wasn’t even sure if his belch had been his own doing, and he could now feel a slick layer of moisture lubricating where his lips joined with the dense fleshy substance that held him so tightly in place.<br />
<br />
And through it all he could not only taste the vile sensation of shit in his mouth, but smell, even without breathing, that same intense stench mixed in with the revolting odour of a men’s locker room.<br />
<br />
The strangely familiar guys voice returned, snapping Jay out of his disgusting sensory dive.  Still heavily distorted it spoke once more in clear frustration.<br />
<br />
“Fine, whatever… I’ll try again later.”<br />
<br />
That voice… it was Jeff!  The pitch was shifted down a little but it was definitely him Jay realised!<br />
<br />
‘Jeff can you hear me?! Help! I don’t know what’s happening!’ Jay tried to call out, but his voice only echoed within his own mind.  He tried to form the words but his mouth stubbornly refused to cooperate beyond the faintest of twitching, fidgeting and loosening.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly Jay felt a sense of motion as he and everything around him tensed up and shifted in place, launching upwards momentarily before coming once more to relative stillness.  He continued to writhe within his unknown fleshy prison.  To his left the pressure against him tensed and released, then to his right, then both.  Jay’s mouth felt crushed by the actions as they repeated several times over.  He struggled to maintain control over his mouth, each clench diminishing his control until his mouth was once more firmly locked shut and the pressure fluctuations abated.<br />
<br />
‘Please, Jeff, if you’re there help me! I don’t know what’s going on!  Please!’.  Jay nearly wept to himself within his mind.<br />
<br />
And so it was that the newly transformed anus, once known as Jay and for now entirely oblivious to the true nature of its situation, began its new existence.  He, or rather it, was wedged within the deepest depths of its former best friend and equally oblivious new master’s warm fleshy ass cheeks.  A sphincter, anus, arsehole.  No longer human, and soon, so very and inevitably soon, to experience the full horrific range of its new functions.</p>
