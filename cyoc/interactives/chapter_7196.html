<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"It's not that bad," said the demon, not really paying attention to his dice roll.  "After all, Sid, I'm a sex demon, now.  How different is your own change?"<br /><br />

"There's a world of difference," responded the lion, looking down and fastening his pants again.  His huge, meaty paws, however, stayed pressed against his crotch, his fingers massaging himself through the fabric, unable to resist his boiling desires.<br /><br />

"So you say," responded the demon, grinning.  "But -in the end- what's the real difference between a demon driven only for sex and a human driven only for sex?"<br /><br />

Tyler snorted, derisively.  "Dave," he said to the Incubus using the being's former name, "I don't know all of what was done to you by the game but can't you let up a bit?  This really isn't helping..."<br /><br />

The demon smiled through sharp teeth as the looked at the tiny man next to him.  "What?  Jealous that I'm not paying as much attention to you, tiny?"  He laughed with more than a hint of cruelty at his partner's scale, and winked one lavender eye in his direction.  "Don't worry:  there's enough of me to go around..."<br /><br />

However, at that moment, the demon stopped.  A strange look came over his face and he shook his head, briefly, as if to clear it.  He blinked again, an expression of confusion spreading across his angelic features.<br /><br />

The rabbit looked at the Incubus, curiously.  "What's wrong?"<br /><br />

"You ... you shut up," muttered the demon, with frustration.  "I ... I don't have ... to explain myself..."<br /><br />

He stopped and his eyes went to the board.  While he had been speaking, the dice had stopped and his piece moved to its destination, four more spaces along the outer ring of the game board.  There, it had come to rest on one of the Yellow "MENTAL" spaces.<br /><br />

He didn't even have to read the center of the game board to know the effect he was feeling, but his eyes were drawn to it, anyway.<blockquote><i><b>TEMPORARY CHANGE<br />- 6 rounds -</b><br /><br />"So sure, so cocky, so bittersweet,<br />
You know that your place is above.<br />
But while it is true that you feel lust's heat,<br />
Now, you only may fuck those you love."</i></blockquote>"Oh, no..."<br /><br />

Tyler stood up on his chair again to be able to see the center of the board.  He blinked at the words and then back at the demon, curiously.  "What?  Ok, that's a bit inconvenient, but at least its honest..."<br /><br />

The Incubus just kept shaking his head and muttering to himself, under his breath.  He glanced, occasionally, at Sid and the others but, mostly, just stared at the board as the words faded and the game readied itself for the next throw of the dice.<br /><br />

It was Chris, his ears slightly drooping, who spoke up, timidly.  "Guys?  I know what the problem is...  It's Dave ... the demon.  You see," he swallowed hard, hoping the others wouldn't shut him up again, "demons can't love.  It's something that's common in just about all legends...  Demons, well, Incubi mostly, don't really ever feel love.  They can't..."<br /><br />

The demon snapped his head up and glared at the rabbit with blazingly bright eyes.  Violently, he rose, his huge, bat-like wings extending fully from wall-to-wall in the small dorm room's space.  The light from his solid orbs cast their glow over everyone at the table as he snarled and pounded one fist into the other.  "That's right, smartass; but I don't remember asking your fucking opinion!"<br /><br />

Chris winced and sunk deeper into his chair, the demon rising and looming over the table across from him.<br /><br />

"But there's something you don't know, legend-boy:  Incubi <i>need</i> sex!  We starve without it!  If I can't ...perform... unless I love someone, I'm doomed to starve to death!"<br /><br />

Sid looked at the board and then back up at the luscious, handsome, desirable...  He shook his head and stroked his buried erection some more, forcing his eyes to the board.  "And ... and you'll starve in the next six rounds?" he asked, plainly, trying not to think about the Incubus' body pressed firmly against his own...<br /><br />

"What?!"  The demon's fury at his own, game-inspired impotence, fanned his emotions to a roaring conflagration.<br /><br />

"It's true," the 2'6" tall Tyler said, trying to calm the demon down.  "It's only a temporary change; you'll make it..."<br /><br />

"That's not the point," snarled the nameless creature in response.  "I ... I still feel..."<br /><br />

The rest of the men at the table went silent, waiting for the Incubus to finish.  Slowly, the dark coloration of his skin faded a bit from where it had darkened during his outburst.  Sighing the huge creature folding his wings against his back and sat down in his chair.  He shook his head somberly and sighed.<br /><br />

"...castrated..." he finally said, in a low tone.<br /><br />

Tyler nodded and looked around the table.  The others were in a bad state.  Sid was still stroking his groin, moaning subtly through his leonine muzzle as he tried to keep his lusts in check.  The demon, inhuman creature though it was, still was Dave at its heart and it was feeling ... raked over the coals.  As for Chris, the most hated man he could imagine:  that lovely, dear man was clearly frightened of both the larger men at the table; his ears pressed against his scalp and his eyes wide with nostrils flaring every few moments.<br /><br />

The game was going to do them in unless they took a break from it.<br /><br />

Sid had suggested they take a break and Tyler was beginning to think that was the right course of action.  "Ok," he said, "let's just keep going on.  We'll stop briefly to catch our breath after Chris' next turn..."<br /><br />

With that, he rolled the dice and stayed standing on his chair.  He adjusted his clothing and retied the tent-like, voluminous fabric around himself as he watched the small cubes come to a stop...</p>
