<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There in the darkness, in their Barbie Malibu beach house prison, the seven shrunken teenagers all wearing ballet tights and tops chronivacked onto them by Emma Chase debated what they should do next.  Some of the debate was reasonable.  Some of it was heated.  Football player Eric, looking slightly ridiculous in his skintight white tights browbeat Felix.  Slender Mark, perfectly at home in ballet tights, joined in as well till Jeff, the usual leader of the group, had to jump in and break it up for Felix's safety.  But even amid the frustration, Jack could joke &quot;You know, it's not being shrunk to 7 inches tall or having a half inch long penis or having a psychotic boy hating girl controlling us who might turn me into plastic or a pomegranate that really upsets me.  It's being forced to wear ballet tights against my will.  If I had a pair of buns like Tony or Mark or Felix, that'd be one thing, but this is inhuman!&quot;<br />
<br />
They all laughed and Claire added.  &quot;Well, Emma's a psycho but I've gotta go along with the all-boys-must-wear-ballet-tights program&quot; and then ran a finger along the spandexed rears of first modestly muscled Jack then exceptionally muscular Mark and Tony.<br />
<br />
With things calmed down, they discussed their next step.<br />
&quot;We've gotta get out of here right away&quot; said Tony.  &quot;She's nuts.  She might come back in the morning and turn us into anything or just erase our minds.  Maybe the guy from Trans Dem Labs bails us out.  But he can't if we're wiped out before he gets here&quot;<br />
&quot;Where are you gonna go?&quot; Demanded Jeff.  &quot;The key to this is the chronivac.  Even if you could get out of this dollhouse prison, even if you could get out of this house, where are you going to go, Tony?  You don't know where the chronivac is and outside, you might get eaten by a dog or a cat or a bird or run over.  We've gotta plan how to get out of here and then go when we know where the chronivac is&quot;<br />
Tony and Jeff went back and forth with their argument.  Eventually the others sided with Tony for immediate escape if possible.  But how?  It was hard to see anything in the dark, so they resolved to get up at dawn and try then.  Tony and Claire took one bed on the ground floor of the Barbie malibu beach house. They went to sleep in their ballet costumes, sleeping on their sides, spooning with Claire within his embrace.  <br />
<br />
Tony awoke feeling great.  His love, Claire was in his arms.  He could smell her with every breath.  But quickly, things went downhill.  Tony had a tremendous erection but felt tremedously restricted.  He realized he was wearing ballet tights and a dance belt.<br />
&quot;What the . . ?&quot;<br />
Then he realized he looked over the nape of her neck and saw the bizarrely garish colors of the inside of the Barbie beach house and remembered that he'd been shrunk to just 7 inches tall and was being held prisoner by boy hating Emma Chase in a dollhouse.  His spirits plummeted as his humiliating circumstances came back to him.  With a deep sigh, Tony separated from Claire.  He ran his hand along her shoulder, waiting for his erection to subside and reorganized his thoughts, vowing to get her out of htis predicament.<br />
<br />
The first light of morning was just creeping into the room as Tony walked around the Barbie beach house looking for some way out.  He checked every window again and every door.  He cursed his tiny size as bowed his back and tried to bull forward and push apart one snapped on seam at the side of the dollhouse imprisoning him.  He couldn't budge it.  Jeff was also up and he and Tony discussed what they'd found.  Besides the doors and windows, the beach house had snapped together seams on one side that seemed to provide a vulnerable point but Jeff had tried to get work it open upstairs just as Tony had downstairs and neither 7 inch tall teenage boy had moved it at all.<br />
<br />
In the distance, they could hear Jeff's sister Suzy yawning and stretching.  &quot;What the hell?&quot; snapped Jeff.  &quot;She's never up this early&quot;.  But this morning, she was up early, excited at the prospect of seeing her new human toys again, including, best of all, her older brother Jeff now reduced to 7 inches tall. <br />
<br />
When she peered in through the windows, there were her human dolls in their ballet tights and tops with elastics wound about their chests and ankles.  She undid the elastic keeping the front door closed and picked her brother Jeff and Tony out from the heaps of shrunken bodies on the upper and lower floors and then tied the doors shut again.  <br />
<br />
Suzy laughed and rubbed their asses together.  &quot;Hey, you two are doing the bump!  Ahahahahahahaha&quot;.  She turned on her radio and with one teenage boy in each hand, sang along with the top 40 hits and made her 7 inch tall brother and friend &quot;dance&quot; to all the songs.  Tony and Jeff were absolutely furious at the humiliating way they were bounced up and down to the beat and eventually had their faces pressed against each other's by Suzy to simulate a kiss.  When Suzy went to the bathroom, she dropped the two doll sized boys in her underwear drawer and shut it tight.  <br />
&quot;Still wanna wait?&quot; grumbled Tony in the dark as panties as big as tents finished folding down on top of them.<br />
&quot;No.  I'm with you&quot;<br />
<br />
A little while later, a grinning Suzy opened the drawer and tossed first Jeff then Tony what seemed like 50 feet into the air only for them to land softly in the thick comforter on her bed.  Both hated that she could so casually terrify them.  <br />
<br />
Suzy dressed and then carried the two tiny teenage boys over to her doll collection in another corner of the room.  She took the severed head of a plastic animal doll, a donkey, and with an effort that required a grunt popped the donkey head onto Tony's head.  She then took a baby's doll head and dropped it onto Jeff's head.  Then she took the further humiliated pair and stuffed them back into the dollhouse along with half an apple for food.  <br />
&quot;Don't worry.  You seven won't be alone.  We're going to get another beach house and all the boys from the swim team and the baseball team and the-the, well, all the teams will be here.  See ya after school!&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as she was gone, the other seven got up from where they lay on the floor of the Barbie beach house.  They weren't even tied up, the elastics that appeared to Suzy to still be bonds were only lying atop them.  They'd correctly guessed that she'd want to play with Jeff and Tony.  The other five quickly removed Jeff and Tony's rubber band bonds and pulled the baby girl doll head off Jeff.  It took all six of the others pulling at Tony's new plastic jackass head to get it off him with a final -POP-.  Tony thanked them and announced that he might have figured a way out.  He pushed their tiny bed to one side and showed the others that there was another door at the floor of the ground level of the Barbie beach house.  <br />
<br />
Tony planted his ballet slippered feet against the railing of the stairway and pushed with all his muscle against the floor.  The eyes of the others all went wide.  The floor seemed to give against the push of 7 inch tall Tony.  If just one of them could get it to give some, what could they do all together?  First Jeff, then Eric tried the same thing and they all got the snapped shut compartment at the bottom of the beach house to give.  But the problem was that they could only get it to move so far.  Then it seemed that the hard plastic was stopped from giving further by the floor.  Try as they might, they couldn't move the plastic enough for any of them to squeeze out.<br />
<br />
They had a few hours of scattered acts of desperation.  Mark ran across the ground floor and jumped feet first at one of the windows.  He bounced off.  The windows were a special plastic.  Mark and Eric also tried to throw furniture through the windows but it too bounced off.  They hurled themselves at all the doors also to no effect.  They tried standing on each other's shoulders to see if they could push the roof off but the muscular power of two 7 inch tall teenage boys was insufficient.  Finally, they sat down and ate several mouthfuls of the apple half.  It seemed the size of a beanbag chair to the shrunken seven but it tasted just as good as always.  A half hour later, though, they had the problem of figuring out where to piss and shit.  The beach house had a sort of a bathroom, but the toilet was just a single piece of plastic.  The top couldn't even be pulled up.  Finally, they settled on going in one of the downstair closets and tearing off pieces of the coarse blanket on one of the beds to wipe themselves.  <br />
<br />
The beach house started to have a foul smell, though, with their tiny wastes polluting it.  It added impetus to their desire to get the hell out of their tiny prison but they flailed about for an escape.  Finally, Tony had an idea.<br />
&quot;Listen!  I've got it!  I've got it&quot; cried Tony calling them all together onto the upper floor.  &quot;We're going to get out that seam in the plastic on the floor downstairs&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, then why the hell did you call us all up here?&quot; chuckled Jack.<br />
&quot;Because we can't get out if the house is upright.  We've got to try to overturn the beach house.  Then there won't be a floor below the plastic there and we'll be able to get out&quot;<br />
The others all looked at him skeptically except Claire who hugged his side and ran her palm along the side of his left buttock.  &quot;You really think we can do that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure.  Would you build this thing to protect against that?  It probably wasn't taken into account, protection against overturning.  We've got to move all the furniture to the upper floor and against that wall&quot; said Tony pointing to one side of the house and then all run and throw our little bodies against that wall to try to overturn it.&quot;<br />
The others sighed and went along with it, mostly out of desperation.  There wasn't anything else to do.  So, they brought the bed and chairs and tables from the first floor and stacked them against one wall upstairs.  They moved all the upstairs furniture against that wall, too.<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; began Tony &quot;Now what counts is mass and speed.  Eric's the heaviest one.  We've gotta let him run from the other side of the house to that wall.   Mark, you and Claire are the lightest.  We want to all hit the wall at the same time.  So, we can't all run through that narrow hallway.  You and Claire should run from the opposite wall of the room on that side.  There's enough room for me, Felix, Jack and Jeff to run across that front room.  We'll let Eric start just before we go so that we hit at the same time.  Everybody got it?&quot;  There were nods all around and then they took their assigned spots.  On the count of three, they all ran and jumped.  The house rocked to that side.  It teetered and almost went over but righted itself.  The seven miniature teenagers went from euphoria to disappointment.  But they tried again and again and finally the beach house turned over.  They cheered and clapped their tiny hands and got to their feet then made their way to the seam in the floor of the beach house that Tony had found. Tony and Eric planted their feet against the now horizontal stairway railing and pushed with all their might.  With a squeak and then a pop, the seam in the floor let go under the onslaught of the two tiny titans.  Skinny Mark squeezed out first then Claire, Felix and Jeff.  From outside, Jeff held the seams apart as Tony and Eric escaped, too.<br />
<br />
All seven ran and shouted with delight at gaining a measure of freedom.  They ran across the carpet of Suzy's room.  It seemed like knee high grass in a meadow to them.  And then they encountered her door.  It was shut and latched.  They looked at each other.  How do we get past this?  The doorknob looked impossibly high above them.  But Mark squeezed his slender body under the door, his muscular little ass compacted just a but as he went under.  One after another, Tony, Claire, Jack, Felix and Jeff squeezed under the bottom of the door.  Eric eyed the opening warily.<br />
&quot;Come on fatass!&quot; Jack laughed from the other side.  Eric grumbled and only got through with the help of the others grabbing his arms and pulling him through.  <br />
<br />
Now, the seven miniature teens in ballet outfits ran down the hallway to the top of the stairs.  In the living room below, the clock tolled on the half hour.  From the top of the stairway, the seven 7 inch tall teens could see that it was 2:30.<br />
&quot;We've gotta get out of here now!  My sister'll be home any time now!&quot; shouted Jeff.  Jeff wanted them all to stay together and go down one step at a time.  Tony looked at the first 10 foot high seeming step, the first of 13 and wondered if there was a better way.  He glanced up at the bannister and saw it.  He took Claire's hand and led her over to the ornate, vertical wooden poles leading up to the bannister.  Each spoke had plenty of whirls and edges carved into it to allow any reasonable athlete 7 inches high to climb it.  Tony made his way up easily.  So easily that he climbed back down to help Claire from below.  Whenever she had a moment's trouble, he gave a push to her tights or tutu and helped her make it.  Finally, he jumped to the next pole and climbed up onto the shiny dark bannister.  He had trouble stopping himself with his slick tights but managed to slide just past where Claire was climbing up and helped pull her up onto the railing.  She gave him a smile and a meaningul look in the eyes and slid in behind him with her arms around his waist as though she was behind him on a motorcycle.  The bannister was two inches wide, requiring Tony and Claire to spread their legs apart and they ran their slippered feet along a raised edge at the bottom of the rail.  Tony looked at the drop before them.  This rivaled any amusement park ride he'd ever seen.  &quot;Here goes!&quot; Tony shouted and he let up on the squeeze from his legs.  Immediately, his slick tights provided insufficient friction and they started to slide down the bannister.  They zoomed past the other five teens scaling down their third step, picking up speed till, near the bottom, Tony squeezed with his little thighs as hard as he could.  They slowed but it looked like they'd fly right off the end until Claire squeezed too and Tony pressed his little hands against the bannister, too.  At last they came to a halt with inches to spare.  Tony's upper body leaned out over the edge.<br />
<br />
Tony climbed down from the bannister to the vertical pole just before it and positioned his back so that Claire could step down onto him.  After she did and had gotten herself to a steady position, he climbed down a bit further.  He did that all the way down, always staying just below her so that he could catch her if she slipped.  They hugged and kissed on the first step of the stairway and then jumped down to the floor.  &quot;My prince&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I'm not much of a prince like this, seven inches tall, but we'll fix this&quot;.  They kissed again and ran, holding hands, to the wall beside the door.  They ran because they could hear sounds outside.  Tony pulled Claire too him at the molding just inside the front door.  <br />
<br />
And then, to their horror, the door swung open.  In came two giants who seemed sixty feet tall.  Jeff's sister Suzy and Emma Chase.  Each had a backpack off her shoulder and held in front of her.<br />
&quot;That was so funny what you said to those boys before shrinking them!&quot; Suzy giggled.  &quot;Size isn't everything but it's something you won't have!  Haha!  Something you won't have!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Emma saw the other five shrunken teens out of the corner of her eye.  Her face immediately twisted into an expression of fury.  Suzy saw it and stopped giggling.  Both of them ran to the stairway to corral the five there.  When they stepped forward but before Emma slammed the door behind her, Tony and Claire slipped out the door unnoticed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; shouted Tony and grabbing her hand.  &quot;We can't help them now.  All we can do is make a run for it&quot;<br />
<br />
And that they did, running across the front step then jumping down one step to the grass below.  They sprinted across the front yard, the freshly cut grass seeming knee high to them.  At the curb, Claire asked &quot;Which way?&quot;<br />
&quot;We have to get away from here as soon as possible, whichever way we go&quot; said Tony looking around frantically.  There was a 10 speed bike lying next to the curb across the street but that was useless to 7 inch high teenagers.  Not far down the curb from them was a skateboard. Tony went to it and Claire followed.  But he could see that the street in front of Jeff's house was fairly steep.  He'd never be able to control it going downhill and he tried to push it uphill and got nowhere.  He felt that they were making a mistake to not be at least running somewhere and he took Claire's hand and started to sprint downhill.  On their little 3 inch long legs, they got two driveways down before tiring.  But it was a lucky place to be.  Just as they got there, a thirty year old VW Beetle was started in the driveway.  Tony pulled Claire to follow him that way and before the rusted car could get going, Tony jumped onto the running board style step next to the passenger's door.  He pulled Claire up and they reached into holes in the sheet metal to steady themselves.<br />
&quot;Your carriage milady&quot; said Tony with a bow earning himself a playful pat of the head from Claire.<br />
<br />
When he VW made a turn down the street, Tony looked back 500 feet and saw Emma Chase storming out of Jeff's house and looking around.  Claire saw it too.  &quot;They're completely fucked back they're.&quot;  she said and Tony nodded.  &quot;What're we gonna do?&quot;<br />
&quot;We're going to school&quot; said Tony.<br />
<br />
Back at Jeff's house, Emma stormed back inside and up to Suzy's room.<br />
&quot;I can't find them, but it doesn't matter.  They're 7 inches tall.  They can't stop what we're going to do&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course not&quot; laughed Suzy and she grabbed the four swim team members.  &quot;This'll be a lot less transition for you guys&quot; she said and dropped one after another already miniaturized swim team member into the giant 750 gallon fish tank that stood where the Barbie malibu beach house had stood.  <br />
<br />
The five teenage boys, already perplexed at being inexplicably shrunk down to 7 inches tall and then, bizarrely attired in ballet tights and tops, felt an electric wave pass through them for a second time.  This time, as they treaded water, they felt their bodies changing in ways they couldn't understand.  Their clothes disappeared and their arms and legs seemed to wither away.  At first they felt terror at falling into the water and not being able to stay atop it.  Their first &quot;breaths&quot; of water were terrifying.  But after just a few seconds, it felt completely natural.  Each boy was covered in bright scales and had gills.  Each was a tropical fish.   They started swimming through the tank and saw five others besides the fish that had been their teammates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see you escape now&quot; snickered Emma.</p>
