<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The uplifting of the four turkeys into Velociraptor Dinotopians was a big part of the Thanksgiving celebration for 2023 and had brought in some measure of coverage on the uplifting. Of course, they wouldn&#39;t cover the actual uplifting and the sex that followed, as to a degree that was something that often happened when potential mates either converted together or were uplifted together. And with the interest of privacy and consent in mind, the coverage was limited more to a formal introduction of the new Gus, Maple, Matilda, and Pumpkin, and because of their status as Dinotopians, Animalia Ambassadoria had asked that Sophie and Roland handle the main part of that... though, JC and Pauline also came along. <br />
<br />
The arrangement took a bit of work, as the two Pterodactylus Dinotopians and two Microraptor Dinotopians still had their college classes at SMU. They did get a break for Thanksgiving, but there was some sense that there was a preference for either arranging transport to Dino City to share the dinner with the Green and Ramos families there, or potentially arrange for a flight to Lyre and have dinner with their families. Afterall, family was important for these holidays, but the new main cast of Animalia Ambassadoria had a bit of a tighter leash, particularly to keep things in line for school credits and so on. There was also the point that because Sophie, Roland, JC, and Pauline were all Dinotopians, and with the last two being uplifted into Microraptors from African Grey Parrots that they would have more familiarity with the issues that Gus, Maple, Matilda, and Pumpkin would be adapting to. They ultimately accepted that and agreed to the trip to Mesozoic Enclave in Colorado to handle the coverage.<br />
<br />
It did allow for a bit of a reunion with Gerry and Sal, who had been part of the project that saw to JC and Pauline&#39;s uplifting. They were happy to keep up the work for Horizon and for possible side projects should Rex be called to participate in a dig and that made for some conversation while they were waiting for Gus, Maple, Matilda, and Pumpkin to finish and get dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were doing well, right?&quot; JC asked to Sal.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far as things go,&quot; Sal answered, &quot;though... I&#39;d imagine that they&#39;re enjoying themselves right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All part of things that come up with newly uplifted couples... or potential couples,&quot; Gerry gave a chuckle, &quot;as I&#39;m sure all of you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roland and I are only single dosed,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;we grew up into present forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
JC and Pauline held each other&#39;s hands, as they did become bond-mates after they were uplifted and stayed close to Sophie because of JC seeing her as a mother figure. They did nod to that, though the one question that came up was obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... how will they adapt to things there?&quot; JC wondered, &quot;I mean... there are four of them and Colorado isn&#39;t going to legalize things the way Nevada has... and they may not want things that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally, the same way many others do...&quot; Gerry commented, &quot;there are those two Japanese women that became Velociraptor Dinotopians... one found a boyfriend who I believe was in high school with you... or was in college at the time, I can&#39;t remember which, and the other won the interest of a fashion design company... which and who, we don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They may have converted their boyfriends by now,&quot; Sal gave a chuckle, &quot;but the theory is there. Even if Maple, Matilda, and Pumpkin decide they don&#39;t like Gus&#39;s personality, someone may be more than willing to convert to be with them... and some women may want to convert to be with Gus... Some may not convert and be content for companionship.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at about that time that there was a knock on the door from the inside of the room. Sal and Gerry carefully moved forward to open the door and let the four uplifted representatives of Project  Niwrad come out. They were wearing relatively simple clothing that was left for them to wear. Things had been made to fit Animalian sizes, even if they weren&#39;t super fancy. Pauline noted that all four of them were a little but uneasy with some things and scratched at places, which was often understood. Many Animalians had long given the commentary that some fabrics irritated things like fur and feathers by laying on top of them, and for many Dinotopians, and Dromaeosaurs in particular, that would be an issue. As given the closer relationship between them and birds, it was assumed that animals like Velociraptor had a full coat of feathers that covered most of their bodies, and for Gus, Maple, Matilda, and Pumpkin, this was no different.<br />
<br />
They had a fan of tail feathers that were similar in shape to what Yuki and Sora had with their tails, but it was different from how the newly uplifted Dinotopians would have had as mundane domestic turkeys. Largely as the physical tails on modern birds was relatively short and the length that people saw was really the length of the feathers themselves. As Dinotopians, they gained the longer tails that many dinosaurs had, which changed how people viewed Gus, Maple, Matilda, and Pumpkin&#39;s tails. JC and Pauline had gone through similar changes. The real difference was that the African Gray Parrot was not known for a wide arching tail the way Domestic Turkeys were known for, or at least depicted as having. And, like Sora and Yuki, while they had the wing and flight feathers on their arms, they now shielded the clawed hands that gave them wing-like arms that were different from JC and Pauline in that they had kept their wings. This drew some attention to them... though they also noted Sophie and Roland.<br />
<br />
“You all still have your wings,” Gus said to the group.<br />
<br />
“Though… yours have fingers,” Pumpkin commented to Sophie, noting the three finger like digits at the apex of her wings, and which were resting on her shoulders. JC and Pauline had similar structures, largely as Microraptor wasn’t a true bird.<br />
<br />
“Roland and I grew wings,” Sophie answered and took her bond mate’s hand in her own, “we were Human before we became Pterodactylus Dinotopians.”<br />
<br />
“My mate, JC and I, kept our wings,” Pauline offered to them, “we were once African Gray Parrots…”<br />
<br />
&quot;We were Broad Breasted White Turkeys,&quot; Gus answered and then looked down to his feet and down his muzzle, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what we are now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what are you?&quot; Pumpkin asked to JC and Pauline, &quot;if they&#39;re Pterodactyls.... what are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you fly?&quot; Maple wondered, noting the flight feathers on JC and Pauline&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were uplifted as part of a program for the state of Colorado to pardon turkeys as part of the celebration for Thanksgiving... they do it in about every state, and at the national level, it&#39;s a big thing,&quot; Sal commented, &quot;which allowed you to become Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your uplifting was part of a special project, called Niwrad, that would reverse engineer you from bird to a specific type of Animalian, that would be closer to your common ancestor with other dinosaurs,&quot; Gerry added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dinosaurs? Like them?&quot; Gus wondered, pointing to Sophie and Roland.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pterodactylus is actually a Pterosaur... related, but not from the exact same family,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;Dinosaurs were a group of animals that evolved in the Triassic and ruled the Earth until the end of the Cretaceous... though, one specific group of Theropod Dinosaurs survived that extinction event...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Birds,&quot; Sal answered, &quot;which was what enabled us to uplift you into Velociraptor Dinotopians... Though it would seem you kept the feather coloration you had before your uplifting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Velociraptor?&quot; Pumpkin wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A predatory species from China...&quot; JC answered, &quot;and one that actually was about the same size as what you probably were as Broad Breasted White Turkeys... at least so far as the weight estimates go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The best-known fossil of it is one that had a Velociraptor fighting a Protoceratops that was found in an area where the scientists think both got encased in mud or sand while fighting,&quot; Pauline added, &quot;and to answer some of your earlier questions, my mate, JC, and I became Microraptor Dinotopians... It&#39;s another species of Dromaeosaur, though more distantly related to Velociraptor, and lived in a more forested environment in a different part of China.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And while it&#39;s smaller than Velociraptor, it&#39;s not thought that Microraptor could attain powered flight for long, if at all,&quot; JC added, &quot;mostly from the way its arm/wings are muscled to the chest... but with wing feathers on the legs, they could probably glide very well, and which actually probably worked quite well in the forest it lived in. So... Pauline and I lost our ability to fly when we were uplifted, but we can still glide and do well at low speeds, which Sophie and Roland can&#39;t match.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Pterosaur wings work something like a bat&#39;s wing in that a lot of the membrane that makes the wing is often anchored to the legs and feet as well,&quot; Sophie explained, &quot;the advantage that Pterosaurs get in flight is more a sensitivity in feeling the air currents while in flight as the air will flow over our wings in a way that we can feel and sense in minute detail on how the wind is moving. At least with the mundane animal... Animalians and Dinotopians will often have different anatomy from their mundane counterparts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like these?&quot; Matilda asked hefting one breast slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... those are... well they&#39;re part of a system that mammals have, and are largely shaped like those on Human women,&quot; Sophie said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Except bigger,&quot; Gus said, &quot;though... I fell... like I&#39;ve lost things... the muscles are nice... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Gerry said to him, &quot;everyone loves Raptors. If one of these three doesn&#39;t want to be your bond-mate, I&#39;m sure someone may jump at the opportunity. Though, before Sophie and her group can provide the formal introduction for Animalia Ambassadoria and let you experience your first Thanksgiving as Animalians... we will need to provide the vaccine to make sure the Animalia Virus in your system, which is what uplifted you, would no longer be infectious... at least for the year.&quot;<br />
<br />
There seemed to be some acceptance of that.</p>
