<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was once a time where summer vacation would have covered all or at least most of August. But school regulations have changed quite a lot, even from only a few years ago. Some might even question the need to be returning physically to school, considering there was still a pandemic going on. Admittedly, the virus was mainly confined to people who were un-vaccinated and there were a lot less of them now. And since Animalia has developed its own version of the vaccine, Animalians were considered 99.8% safe. There was still a 1 in 5000 chance of catching the new strain of coronavirus, but that was acceptable parameters as long as basic hygiene rules were maintained.<br />
<br />
And while there still may be some restrictions this year, there were still seniors who were starting their final year with style. Considering WSA doesn&#39;t have a strict dress code, just so long as students remained reasonably decent. So there were plenty of senior girls arriving with short skirts, low-cut tank tops, or unbuttoned shirts. But that wasn&#39;t to say that guys didn&#39;t get in on this action in their own way.<br />
<br />
Everyone takes notice when a shiny red sports car drives up, especially if it&#39;s driven by a bikini supermodel. And it wasn&#39;t just any supermodel. Zoe had been a prominent part of Animalia&#39;s Modeling School since its very beginning. There was no question that the lovely lioness was one of Animalia&#39;s top models, especially since she was wearing a bikini that showed off her toned, curvaceous body. But this wasn&#39;t Zoe&#39;s big return to WSA, she had already graduated two years ago. This was someone else&#39;s big senior debut.<br />
<br />
The lion in the passenger seat stepped out of the car, pausing for effect. He was a big lion, as big as any of the other lions who have obviously double-dosed. The muscle shirt, leather jacket, tight jeans, and sunglasses were there to enhance his coolness as well as show how big and muscular he was. He turned back to the car and said loud enough for everyone to hear him, &quot;Thanks for dropping me off, babe. I wasn&#39;t sure if you had the time with all your modeling work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, modeling work is fine, but summer has to end sometime,&quot; said Zoe, also loud enough for others to heal, &quot;So I better be heading off to college now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be looking forward to seeing you on the weekends,&quot; said the lion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to be as available as possible,&quot; said Zoe. She got out of the car before giving the lion a big kiss, popping one leg. It was just as much showing off as it was showing affection. And she was pretty sure every straight guy present was watching her breasts push into her hunky boyfriend&#39;s broad chest while her tail waved over her delicious ass. Then she got back into the car and started driving away. Before she got too far, she shouted, &quot;I love you, Jeff!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too!&quot; called Jeff before shouldering his backpack and heading for the front doors. Yep, that was definitely going to get everyone&#39;s attention. Even if everyone hadn&#39;t seen it, there were more than enough witnesses to spread word around of how Jeff, the guy who moved here two years, whose dad hooked up with a super-hot lioness while Jeff remained single and single-dosed, was now a huge, double-dosed lion who was dating one of Animalia&#39;s top supermodels and got dropped off in a shiny red sports car.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s family and Zoe did quite a bit of work to make a big impression. Though honestly, there was very little of that which was staged. Yes, Zoe was definitely Jeff&#39;s girlfriend and she would be starting college this year after putting it off last year. Yes, Jeff had been double-dosed to completely mature into his prime. His dad and stepmom wanted to make Jeff&#39;s senior year special so they allowed him to double-dose and got him a cool wardrobe to show off, if only on the first day. The only things that were pretense was the sports car (which was borrowed from someone else, though Jeff&#39;s dad said if Jeff made good grades this year, he might get his own) and Zoe going to college in a bikini (her classes weren&#39;t starting that day and she was going to wear more modest clothing for class).<br />
<br />
But even if this first impression fell flat on its face, Jeff didn&#39;t mind. Being bondmates with Zoe made up for Kinjara becoming his stepmom and his parents&#39; constant teasing before that. Zoe was definitely something special and Jeff was glad they got together that summer for a lot of fun. And Jeff was particularly happy when he and Zoe got to the double-dosing about a week ago.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Double-dosing a minor mainly involved filling out paperwork from those parties involved: said minor, their parents/legal guardians, and the provider of their second dose if they were doing something more communal. After all that was done, all that was left was for Jeff and Zoe to seal the deal. Jeff&#39;s folks were happy to leave the two of them alone, they could easily spend a night at another place. Kinjara did offer Jeff and Zoe to have a possible foursome with them, though Jeff and Andrew both agreed that would be taking things too far.<br />
<br />
Zoe eventually arrived with pizza and a movie. The pizza was good, but the movie was definitely not something one would normally bring on a date night. It was one of Animalia&#39;s raunchier flicks. While Animalia wasn&#39;t all about sex like a lot of critics were claiming, there was a small but well-patronized market for pornography, though one has to be an adult or double-dosed to get it. Jeff probably would have gotten in trouble if he was caught with it if he wasn&#39;t about to be double-dosed himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this really being shot on location?&quot; asked Jeff. The movie in question was about a pride of lions hunting zebras in the grasslands, with a very obvious sexualization. Right now, they were watching a female zebra being gang-banged by three lions. &quot;They don&#39;t shoot pornos out in the open, do they?&quot; asked Jeff, having to speak up over the raunchy music and the zebra&#39;s moans.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not hard to get far away from other people over there,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;Lots of wide, open plains with no civilization for miles. You and your family should go there at some point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You realize under most circumstances, this would be an extremely inappropriate thing to do on a date,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted to make sure you were properly worked up,&quot; said Zoe before giving Jeff a light pat on the crotch. &quot;And I can see that it&#39;s working,&quot; she said, feeling the bulge in his pants.<br />
<br />
Jeff raised an eyebrow and said in a teasing tone, &quot;Are you implying that you don&#39;t think you can get me aroused all by yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...let&#39;s test that, shall we?&quot; asked Zoe. With that, she took off her shirt, revealing the bra keeping her large breasts in check. She shimmied out of her pants, showing off her long, curvy legs. The underwear came next, leaving Zoe in the nude. &quot;Am I able to compete with those lionesses?&quot; asked Zoe, the movie now showing three lionesses worshiping their king.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s bulge became more obvious at that. &quot;I think so,&quot; he said, &quot;Just let me get out of these clothes and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment,&quot; said Zoe before handing Jeff over a shirt. He could feel that it was made of a weaker material than usual. &quot;It&#39;s a Ripaway shirt,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;I want you to wear it while you&#39;re double-dosing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to see how big you&#39;ll get in comparison,&quot; said Zoe.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged. He heard these Ripaway clothes were easy to tear for these occasions, so it wouldn&#39;t be hurting him. It didn&#39;t take long for him to be dressed in only that shirt, his leonine cock now on full display.<br />
<br />
Zoe rubbed his cock and said, &quot;Well, you don&#39;t measure bad against the other lions, even if you aren&#39;t fully grown.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stifled a moan before asking, &quot;How many other lion dicks have you seen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough,&quot; said Zoe, not going into detail, &quot;And I think that&#39;s enough talking.&quot; She pushed Jeff onto the couch before climbing on top of him. She fingered her own pussy to get it nice and wet. She smeared some of it over Jeff&#39;s shaft to get it lubed up. Jeff could almost swear he felt the tingling as soon as she did. But she didn&#39;t leave him waiting for long. With greased ease, she slid herself down onto his cock.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned as he felt her take his virginity. The lack of resistance on her part made it clear that hers was already one. But Jeff wasn&#39;t one to begrudge her. It meant that she had more experience than him. Zoe soon started rising and dipping on his cock. She was starting off slow so he could really feel it. And it made it more obvious to them both when he started growing.<br />
<br />
Zoe was a little big bigger than Jeff before, but now the height difference was narrowing. Jeff&#39;s legs were getting one last boost of length as he was already close to maturity beforehand. The biggest indications that he was growing were his muscles. Jeff wasn&#39;t too muscular compared to adult lions after his first dose. But now the muscles were growing larger, pressing against the surface of his skin. His shoulders pushed out more to make more room for the muscular chest forming below it. His pecs hardened into slabs of strength while his abs rose up like foothills. His arms and legs were bulking up with strength and muscle.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s grunts and moans were getting deeper as his chest expanded and his throat widened. His hair had been pretty long, but not quite a mane yet. But now long hair was moving under his neck and towards the tops of his pecs. Zoe let out a loud moan as she felt his cock get a big boost. The nubs on his shaft rubbed her even more as it grew locker and thicker inside her. The balls that had been bouncing against her backside were definitely getting bigger. Jeff grunted as he thrust into her more. Zoe&#39;s eyes rolled as she hit her peak and clamped hard against the pulsing rod. The two lions let out roars as Jeff pumped his first load into Zoe.<br />
<br />
Once they calmed down, Zoe took another look at Jeff. The Ripaway shirt definitely showed the different in mass before and after. Jeff had gone from a teenage, moderately-athletic lion to a full-grown, beefy lion. The tatter remains hung loosely on his mighty frame. Jeff could possibly pass for his father&#39;s twin, asides from a few features. And Andrew was a pretty might lion himself. Zoe almost wished she and Jeff were in that foursome his stepmom offered, but that might be pushing too much. &quot;Well, I think the results speak for themselves,&quot; said Zoe, running a hand down Jeff&#39;s big chest.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked himself over and said, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;d think so.&quot; His voice was still familiar, just an octave or two deeper. &quot;Uh, I know we just did it, but I&#39;m not feeling satisfied yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ok. Lions tend to go at this for hours,&quot; said Zoe, &quot;Besides, I&#39;m on the pill, don&#39;t need to worry about knocking me up.&quot; She pulled off of Jeff, dripping just a little bit. &quot;How about we continue this in your room?&quot; she offered.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dick didn&#39;t shrink down. If anything, it perked up a little more. &quot;Lead the way,&quot; he said with a sexy growl.</p>
