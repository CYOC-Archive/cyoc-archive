<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ay Amigos, gotta take a dip. Watch my back!&quot; Jose casually spoke to his peers in spanglish. Spanish with rare bits of english words.<br />
<br />
Swinging into an open stall, he went down and pulled out his dick and began pumping away, slipping into his heterosexual fantasies of fucking hot Latina babes, thrusting his powerful latino dick into their pu---ass?<br />
<br />
&quot;AY MARICON!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jose shouted loudly as his intense arousal subsided due to that homo thought. Feeling sick and foreign to his own , homophobic and muscular bod as the changes began reversing.<br />
<br />
He watched as the threads he and his homies liked to wear started to shrink in length, and tightening more than usual, as if they are sucking all of those hard earned muscles he prided on with ease.<br />
<br />
Cursing and swearing a long strand of colourful vocabulary as he put his now-smaller, more skater like palms on his head. Feeling his old elementals T shirt and shorts snap back into place as his body re-leaned out from that enormous Mexican mass.<br />
<br />
His skin changed back to white and clean, free of illegal tattoos Jose got when he was thirteen. Free of that homophobe mindset as James was himself once again, feeling awfully disgusted with his lewd heterosexuality he expressed as Jose for the past day.<br />
<br />
He pushed back his limp member in his trousers, as he got out of the stall and---<br />
<br />
SLAM!<br />
The restroom door slammed, as a group of latinos, formerly his homies, cheered loudly and went away. Maybe he insulted another fag just now and---<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!&quot; James slapped himself on the face, hoping to remove and beat that horrid mindset and whatever homophobe that still lingers in him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Im gay again man...., not some straight shit.&quot; He muttered, regretting the consequences after the transformative bliss and raging testosterone that boiled within him during it.<br />
<br />
GROANNNNNN!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...it feels like shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
His body ached, feeling like it had consumed tons of alcohol and spicy delicacies the night before and binged the entire morning. It was approximately 1pm now, which was odd considering the first time he tfed was around a few hours before he reverted.<br />
<br />
Probably these effects last longer or differ from case by case scenarios? He tried deducing a little, before his stomach groaned once more, commanding him to eat as he walked to the first restaurant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh....&quot; He spoke, &quot;Just fried noodles, take away please.&quot; He paid to the counter, surprised to see his wallet full of cash. Before deciding not to question where his other self got it.<br />
<br />
It was a Chinese restaurant quite empty aside from a few asians, thankfully he got in before rush hour. He paid the cashier and sat down far away in an empty table, as he decided to dial for Nick-or whatever the man is at this moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;BRRR, BRRR!&quot;<br />
WOOSH!<br />
<br />
Almost in an instant, groups and groups of asian businessmen came flocking in in their tight suits and office wear, manly and mostly foreign and they formed a long queue at the front. Speaking in their foreign dialects in a formal and firm manner.<br />
<br />
Made for business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! Don&#39;t get distracted James, FOCUS!&quot; Reprimanding himself as he impatiently listened and waited for a response. But as James told himself that, his eyes darted towards the men as he chowed down on the noodles ravishingly with a pair of chopsticks.<br />
<br />
Eyes taking note of their facial features, old but still hot, he remarked briefly. As they all stood up straight, with his back following in pursuit, almost like it&#39;s compulsory to follow the crowd.<br />
  <br />
James continued to sip in the noodles with greater intensity, somewhat savouring and appreciating Chinese food even more as though it was always his preferred choice. <br />
<br />
Feeling his skin taking a toll as it gained a slightly yellowish hue with a mix of tan, asian tan. His back continued to widen itself hard, as those shoulders firmly balanced away the skater&#39;s laid back persona. Showing more firmness and aggression in them.<br />
<br />
Tasting in a salty and foreign flavour, relishing in its delights and tradition. Feeling the new asian genes boiling within him during the process as he ain&#39;t no more local.<br />
<br />
His ears listened to the crowd in the meantime,  not even realising his boner now at full mast as he relished in himself. His tradition and people, feeling home over here and---<br />
<br />
&quot;NO ANSWER!&quot;<br />
<br />
-TRIGGERED!-<br />
<br />
&quot;HOW DARE HE DISRESPECT ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost like a switch, a glare of lightning just surged through his upper neuronal glands , electrifying them and frying those laid back circuits so that his impatience and anger shot through the roof.<br />
<br />
He got up, clutching his phone tightly as it hardened to a china branded one like many of the other customers&#39;. Slipping by them like he&#39;s used to, feeling a familiarity to this scenario.<br />
<br />
With that, James stomped out of the mall and whooshed out a suddenly existent pair of car keys, pressing in an already aged and toughened family car.<br />
<br />
He sat on the driver&#39;s seat, his body leaned up and STRETCHED nicely until his head nearly hit the ceiling, his butt adjusted and tightened like the hard-ass he is, firm and strict like how he is to his family.<br />
<br />
Tons of new memories surge in as he buckled the seat belt and SLAMMED the door. Feeling a tight ring appearing on his finger, fighting a martial bond with rowdy skater teenager-ness, sexual confusion. Which made James even ANGRIER!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fool around...with OTHER BOYS?&quot;<br />
<br />
James stepped down on the peddle, though its more like CRUSHING IT! His worn vans being sandwiched between the peddle and his pair of no nonsense feet, being disciplined by the harshness of the Chinese.<br />
<br />
Cloth and threads are made to adapt, hardening with solid leather as it wrapped around his aged, grown feet. Supported by a pair of plain white socks, those traditional dress shoes understood what its purpose is. Being worn over the years , and yet still polished and shiny like it oughta be.<br />
<br />
His legs shifted uncomfortably, feeling his package grow thicker and more concentrated in girth below. Sandwiching his growing erection underneath a pair of silky briefs made from threads in China.<br />
<br />
His leg hair continues to grow in sparse strands as they scattered around his feet, thighs and trunks. Filling up with sturdy and powerful muscle as an office greyish black material covers it up out of indecency. He was a married man after all!<br />
<br />
BZZT!<br />
<br />
The radio turned on, as the announcer spoke in a funny language he didn&#39;t quite understand. But as the strong smell of business cologne resonates from his arms. He could correct his thinking--<br />
<br />
The traditional way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello ladies and gentlemen, tonight&#39;s song will be a dedication to all of those old timers like us, stay tuned and enjoy.&quot; The announcer spoke-in chinese, he&#39;s chinese, we&#39;re---<br />
<br />
TUNE PLAYS<br />
<br />
&quot;WO SHI YI GE REN!&quot; He sung the lyrics, articulating every bit of the Chinese perfectly like he oughta, he was China born, fortunate enough to work and move into America because he was a skilled businessman.<br />
<br />
He continued to sing heartily, appreciation towards the old generation and all its glory. Why wasn&#39;t he born in that era again? He was much more suited for respect and---<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a....&quot; James slowed down, feeling time slowing by as his bones began filling out, muscles toughing and skin wearing with age with wrinkles here and there. &quot;AH WAS FIFTEEN WHEN THIS SONG CAME OUT!&quot;<br />
<br />
He spoke, like an old man reciting his memories, that&#39;s what his father liked to do when he was 50 too. Feeling a growing respect and a downgrade in society, with a plus of---<br />
<br />
&quot;HONOUR!&quot; <br />
<br />
James proclaimed, feeling the fabric of the inappropriate design of his T-shirt fade away as it aged to a silky light blue. Sleeves rolling all the way down to their wrists, as they form natural cuffs on each side.<br />
<br />
His chest raised upwards, holding high standards for himself as he PUFFED! Out a pair of pecs and abs that firmly tightened against the shirt he&#39;s wearing as they get PRESSED along a row of buttons in the middle.<br />
<br />
His body was much larger, as his arms thickened with years of laborious muscle that he&#39;d managed to keep sturdy and strong for over two decades. Absolute dedication during his daily routine, striving for only excellence and nothing else.<br />
<br />
As he---WEEEEEEEEEZ! THE CAR IN FRONT JUST STOPPED RANDOMLY??!!! Well it was red, but of course, old middle aged men get a pass.<br />
<br />
As he WHEEZED to the left with a tight SCREECH!!!! ---His shirt silkened itself to a long sleeved light blue dress shirt as his collar popped down just below his sexy Adam&#39;s apple, SEXY FOR HIS WIFE!<br />
<br />
Almost like a life time has passed by as he felt like he wasn&#39;t gonna make it there. His gorgeous, beautiful maiden, feeling her protection wrap around his wrist in the form of an expensive silver watch. <br />
<br />
Matching the silver ring he pridefully wore to display the bond he shares with his wife. Without a doubt, A het. As for what he thinks of homo, lets find out...<br />
<br />
HIYAHHHHHHHH!<br />
<br />
PEDLE STOP!<br />
<br />
He stopped, as his immediately turned his head to the right. Fuming mad as adrenaline rushes through him once more like it does on a daily basis. <br />
<br />
He was so astonished by the intense driving that he HONKKKKEEED! Being Asian, obviously he couldn&#39;t keep up on the roads like the opposing youth, as he wound down the window.<br />
<br />
The other guy smugly lifted his shades, glancing over at the older male, inspecting the asian, &quot;uncle&quot; , which he mockingly said to the now wayyyyyyy older James.<br />
<br />
As soon as he remarked that, James hairstyle instantly combed to the sides as it re-kindled itself jet-black. A Conservative side parting hairstyle that cost little to nothing while keeping his face neat and tidy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, uncle?&quot; The young man scoffed at the older male with an expression that sent the married husband fuming with angry, an internal monologue of stereotypical phrases of a high expectations father just sounded and---<br />
<br />
&quot;SO THATS HOW YOU DISCIPLINE YOUR CHILDREN?!!&quot; His internal monologue sounded.<br />
<br />
James could finally recall, work being so demanding nowadays he nearly had forgotten that he&#39;d need to discipline his disobedient gangster son of his. Using many, MANY harsh methods that have been thought down through generations shamelessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I WOULD BEAT THEM!&quot; He simply spoke, as his face sharpened into a sharpened rectangle. Jaw strong and manly in a traditional sense. &quot;ONLY A&#39;S ARE ACCEPTABLE&quot; which was all that mattered in an asian society. It was one of the only things asian parents talked about before going back to their naturally reserved behaviours.<br />
<br />
His eyes became thin and small, arched by the fierce frown of his grey eyebrows. Condescending as ever, and simply stated &quot; its the only way to discipline these kids nowadays!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh listen Mister, I don&#39;t have time for you and your so called, &quot;old generation&quot; way of thinking.&quot; With a cocky smirk, the opposing man looked away and began to crank up the loud, and overbearing music that came from the radio.<br />
<br />
James shook his fist in frustration.<br />
<br />
He HATED disrespect, especially. They should STAND UP and FIGHT LIKE A MAN! Like how they thought him back in China, demanding EXCELLENCE! <br />
<br />
Especially from men due to the surname policy, and making sure their family honour is strong forever THROUGH GENERATIONS! Too bad there are too many half girl-half boys disgracing society....Ah!<br />
<br />
&quot;I BET YOU FOOL AROUND WITH OTHER BOYS!&quot;<br />
<br />
WOOSH! <br />
<br />
The car sped away the moment the middle aged man reprimanded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;GRRRRRRRR&quot; The Asian dad grunted, not even sure if that last insult hit the guy&#39;s ears. But if it did, it would be the most painful thing! <br />
Being a homo! <br />
<br />
That&#39;d bring instant shame to the family! Instant throw out! Which was exactly what he&#39;d do to his son if he doesn&#39;t get STRAIGHT distinctions in school!<br />
<br />
&quot;WAIT TILL I CATCH HIM!&quot; He drove at lightning speed, ignoring speed tickets like he couldn&#39;t understand nor care-less, as he---<br />
<br />
WEEEEEEEEEE! <br />
<br />
Made a horrible streak with the car and parked directly at the side of the road into the hideout. He couldn&#39;t care less about his driving skills, HE ASIAN AFTER ALL! <br />
<br />
&quot;EVERRRRRYTIME FOOL AROUND WITH SISSIES!&quot; Mr Long get out and SLAMMED the car door shut. Walking firmly and sternly down the gang&#39;s hideout, angered and whipping his cane at the walls and leaving nasty marks that seemed to only get worse down the hall.<br />
<br />
And then he entered the boss&#39;s room. Once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;LONG NING CHU!&quot; He roared at the top of his lungs, sending the shaky walls of the room to shudder and crack even further.<br />
<br />
Jia Seng towered over his son, as it sent the frightened teen to shivers, the menacing demeanour he pulled in front of his henchmen, clients and enemies melted away to pure fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit la....Ba....!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough insolence! You&#39;ve dishonoured our family long enough!&quot; PULL! The soon to be elderly middle-aged man pulled his son&#39;s ear, disgracing the rough and tough delinquent in front of his gang, him spouting vulgarities in numerous languages as he was dragged out of the hideout and into the family car. Intending to be sent home immediately so as to ensure he studies.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU NO B-SIAN! YOU A-SIAN!&quot;</p>
