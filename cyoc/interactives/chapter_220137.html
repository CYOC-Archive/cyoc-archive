<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stepping into the library; Reverend Church, Mather, Cromwell and Bashir are instantly awe struck. Scrolls, tombs and books as far as the eye can see; several angels flying about to either to collect some reading material or to place a book back in its proper spot. They were so distracted with the splendor they failed to see an angel approach them.<br />
“Can I help you with anything?”<br />
<br />
Cromwell break s out of his stunned amazement to see a female in a simple white robe that falls to her knees. Knees that are not human in nature. The Angel in question had what looked like the legs of a zebra; stripped fur and ending in black hooves. Her arms are fur cover; the pattern akin to a cheetah. Cromwell was certain the white robe she was wearing was hiding her torso that was also covered in cheetah fur. With wings of a blue jay; the only part of this angel that looked remotely human was her face.<br />
“We would like to read up on some religious text,” Cromwell stammering as he was clearly struck by her beauty.<br />
“Any particular volumes,” the angel responding enthusiastically.<br />
“Anything that has to do with the revolt,” Cromwell answering.<br />
“That is a very specific request,” the angel’s enthusiasm fading; “may I ask why?”<br />
“We are new here,” Cromwell being truthful; “as former ministers on earth, we have questions we would like answered. A fresh perspective on the words of Jehovah,” Cromwell thinking quickly.<br />
<br />
“Inquisitor Semyaza gave us leave from our duties,” Mather answering as he sees Cromwell stumble and stutter; “and as the library is close to inquisitorial headquarters we figured this would be a good start to explore heaven.”<br />
“I would like a copy of the Koran,” Bashir speaking up; “or texts related to the prophet Mohammed.”<br />
“And some refreshments,” Church finally noticing the angel; doing his best not to be horrified at her appearance as he forces a smile.<br />
“Drinks are permitted,” the angel answer; “however food is not. Would you like some tea?”<br />
“That will be fine,” Mather nodding.<br />
“Turkish coffee for me please,” Bashir asking, with Cromwell also nodding to the exotic choice of beverage.<br />
“Follow me then,” The angel responding as she leads them deeper into the library. Stopping and pointing to four large chairs for the group to sit in. “If you could please wait here, I’ll be back with you requested literature. Someone else will be by to give you your drinks.”<br />
“Thank you,” Cromwell stammering; “you name?”<br />
“Azure,” the angel responding; “and your names?”<br />
<br />
Cromwell stammered; his checks flushed as he tries to spit out his name.<br />
“I’m Baziel,” Church speaking. “This is Esh,” Church pointing to Mather.<br />
“Ariel,” Bashir nodding; “and our stammering friend here is Polytimos,” giving Cromwell a playful slap and grin.”<br />
“Please take a seat,” Azure nodding; “and welcome to the grand library.”<br />
<br />
Church watches the angel leave before glaring at Cromwell; “what is your problem?”<br />
“I think he just got struck by cupid’s arrow,” Bashir chuckling; “he’s in love.”<br />
“With that,” Church looking disgusted; “she looks like those disgusting demons we were hiding among.”<br />
“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” Mather looking at the newspaper Semyaza gave them earlier; “what you find horrid, someone else may find pleasing.”<br />
“And at least she is female,” Bashir nodding; “better to fall in love with one of the opposite sex. Or are you being selective with which parts of your bible you believe is fact again,” Bashir looking at Church.<br />
“Point taken,” Church grumbling; “but mark my words, she looks like some demon hell spawn. No good will come from her or her loins.”<br />
“Since when do you have a say in who I can and cannot have a quick tumble with,” Cromwell glaring at Church; “last I check, I’m my own man, capable of making my own decisions. I’m not your son or,” Cromwell driving the metaphorical knife; “your daughter Rachael.”<br />
“Enough with the bickering,” Mather putting the paper down; “no good will come if we are at each other’s throats. Let Cromwell have his flights of fancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reverend Church just glared. The mention of Rachael, turned his stomach as he is unable to end her for the sin she has committed. That sin being, disobeying her father and daring to humiliate him by announcing that she is queer. Couple that with his son refusing to marry the women he arraigned; opting to be with what he assumed was a harlot. Reverend Church still refuses to believe that the girl Josh chose was the daughter of God.<br />
‘God only has one son,” Church muttered to himself; ‘the bible says so.’<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long after that Azure came back with a few volumes for them. Handing Ariel a copy of the Koran, she tells him that there are a couple of alcoves nearby if he wishes to perform his prayers to Allah as Muslims refer to Jehovah.<br />
“Later,” Ariel thanking the angel; “this is fine start though so thank you.”<br />
“Here is a brief synopsis of what happed before and after the revolt,” Azure handing the book to Polytimos. “And for you two I took the liberty of getting a couple of volumes regarding the various family lines of Heaven. Please let me know if you need anything else.”<br />
“Thank you,” Cromwell half getting up and half blushing.<br />
“Dam you got hit with the love bug hard,” Mather chuckling; “you going to ask her out?”<br />
“I’m not sure,” Cromwell looking beet read with embarrassment; “but I can’t deny I do have feelings for her.”<br />
<br />
<br />
*********************************************************<br />
<br />
A few hours later and several cups of the thick sludge that was Turkish coffee, Cromwell gets up. The book he was reading while informative was over his head. All that he could think of was the old angels words.<br />
‘Pray for his forgiveness. He will hear it as if you were standing next to him.’<br />
“If you three will excuse me,” Cromwell getting up; “I think I need to pray. Excuse me Azure,” Cromwell approaching the Zebra-Cheetah angel with the wings of a blue jay; “where are alcoves available for prayer?”<br />
“This way,” The angels answering with a polite wave; “did you find the book to your liking?”<br />
“I’ll confess,” Cromwell sighing; “I had a hard time understanding the context and the reasoning behind it all.”<br />
“Most do,” Azure sighing; “I only wish my mother would open up about it more. She was there and her heart was broken when dad sided with Lucifer. I was still in her womb at the time,” Azure sounding sad; “I only ever met him once and it was during the signing of the peace treaty.”<br />
“What was his name,” Cromwell trying to be polite; If its not too much to ask.”<br />
“Belial,” Azure shaking her head; “I here he is an arch duke or some noble in the circles of hell.”<br />
“Have your tried contacting him,” Cromwell asking; “if not in person, by letter?”<br />
“Communication between heaven and hell,” Azure shaking her head; “is strained. Even with the treaties, there is still animosity between the two sides.”<br />
“You won’t know until you try,” Cromwell providing a comforting smile; “perhaps he wants to talk to you as well but like you is afraid to make the first step. Sometimes all it takes,” Cromwell speaking as he looks at the alcove; “is a leap of faith.”<br />
“You could be right,” Azure nodding; “I’ll pray on your kind words.”<br />
<br />
Cromwell pulls the curtain aside and enters the alcove. Dropping to his knees and placing his hands together he takes a breath and begins.<br />
“Oh god, I beseech you to hear my prayer. I feel I have made an error in judgement when I joined up with the Iron Knights. I thought I would be doing good works in your name. Instead I have been stumbling around like a chicken with its head cut off with no direction save from those who’s intention do not align with yours. I killed. I look a life. Three to be precise. They may have been demons but I now know they have done me no wrong. They most likely did nothing wrong to begin with except pick a side in some stupid squabble from eons past. And now my friend Reverend Church,” Cromwell sighs; “I fear he has let hatred cloud his judgement. I always knew he was bigot and has extreme views on family and marriage. But I would never have believed that he would go so far as to travel to hell just to kill his daughter for making a decision of her own free will. A decision he took umbrage too. Can you please forgive me and help me get out of this mess? I just can’t walk this path that is no longer righteous and honorable.”<br />
<br />
Cromwell ended the prayer with a sign of a cross. While not catholic, he was a Seventh Day Adventist and he tried to follow its teachings. Teaching he knew were difficult in a world full of temptations meant to cause one to stray from the path. Getting up, Cromwell suddenly feels a wave of peace wash over him; bringing him to tears as felt a comforting hand upon his shoulder. Cromwell was certain that Jehovah heard his prayer and answered in his own mysterious way.</p>
