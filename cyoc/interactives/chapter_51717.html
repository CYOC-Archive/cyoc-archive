<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day passed in a blur, I just barely being able to scrape by in my Juniour High classes, which were becoming more and more difficult for me to understand. In the halls I searched for Thomas, but was disappointed that I couldn't find him.<br />
<br />
And to top off all of my problems, I still felt my mind taking slips every time a girl walked by and I suddenly wanted to be dressed like them or wondered if I would grow up to look like them. And it wasn't just when a girl walked past that I felt my mind slip, but it was other times, like when I had to use the lavatory and suddenly found myself in the girl's restroom instead.<br />
<br />
Home, glad that school was over for the day, I felt my mind doing one of those slips and shaking my head, I tried to clear it, wondering if Katherine or my mother were home. Heading into the living room, wanting to play my playstation three, I found my sister watching Barney and friends.<br />
<br />
Mesmerised, I attempt to shake my head, but instead found myself sitting down to watch. As we watched together, my sister crept closer until she was practically sitting on my lap. Leaning toward me, she asked, &quot;If it is all right with Aunt Jeannie, would you like to go swimming with me? You can wear you mermaid bathing suit if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without thinking twice about what she had just asked, I nodded and Katherine, beaming, slid off the couch and went running from the room, leaving me to continue watching Barney and friends. After a bit, I began to wonder why our Aunt was here and not out mother and sliding off the couch, noting that I had shrunk in height and was now about four foot six, I head upstairs, sure that this was where Katherine had run off to.<br />
<br />
Looking for Katherine, I found her in her room, which now had two beds and as well as two dressers. Bothered, and feeling my mind take a slip, I quickly turn away, deciding I don't want to ask her my question. Moving down the hall, I open the door to my room and immediately greeted by the sight of my mother, standing in nothing but a bra and panties.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, I started to back out, but not before my mother started screaming, calling me a little pervert and saying that I knew the rules about entering her room without permission.<br />
<br />
A door opens and Aunt Jeannie could be heard asking, &quot;What is all the ruckus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, I was about to say something, but my mother cut me off by hollering, &quot;Ashley just barged into my room without even knocking. Almost as if she figured she lived there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stunned, I listened as Aunt Jeannie told my mother, &quot;I'll deal with your sister. Go back to your room.&quot; and then coming down the hall, she took my hand and leading back to Katherine's room, she explained, &quot;You know that you just can't go barging into other peoples rooms. Now, be a good boy Ashley and play with your sister. I think she wanted to go swimming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, feeling my mind taking another one of its slips, I allowed myself to be herded into Katherine's room, which I suddenly realised was also my room as well.<br />
<br />
Seeing my sister naked, I turned away and instead opened the closet, to which my sister replied, &quot;I already got your swimsuit out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Closing the closet door, I muttered, &quot;Thanks,&quot; and then unsure what else to do, I began to strip down and then tucking my penis and testicles between my legs, I put on the swimsuit I had worn the previous day, bothered by how much it made me look like a girl.<br />
<br />
Afterward, we returned home and Katherine wanted to play dress-up and seeing no way out of this, I consented, to which I found myself dressed in one of Katherine's dresses and sitting at a plastic tea-table, drinking pretend tea as Katherine served one of her dolls, which I realised was also one of mine.<br />
<br />
Slowing losing myself, I nearly cheered when Aunt Jeannie announced dinner and standing, I debated on whether I should change my clothes or not.<br />
<br />
In the end, I kept the dress on, realising that when I was dressed like this the mind slips were less frequent for some reason. Downstairs, I also discovered that my mother looked a lot younger and I wondered what it was that brought on her age regression, thinking to myself, &quot;She looks about fifteen years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
After dinner, Katherine wanted me to play with her some more and I desperately wanted, but there was something I needed to check out and telling my sister, &quot;I'll be up in a moment,&quot; I made my way to the front hall, wondering if it had disappeared as my mother made her transformation back to what was becoming clear as my older sister, who was also being raised by Aunt Jeannie.<br />
<br />
Placing a hand on the desk in the front hall, I looked at the basket that the mail was placed in, along with house keys and various odds and ends and then taking a deep breath, I opened the drawer.<br />
<br />
My elation grew as I saw the familiar amulet lying amongst the various bits of whatnot within and reaching in, I picked it up.<br />
<br />
Immediately I felt my mind start to slip as I looked at the woman, split in two by the crack down the centre, and what I really wanted was to put the amulet away and go and play with Katherine. Before I could make my decision, a voice behind me said, &quot;It only has enough magick in it left for one person.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, recognising the voice, I looked at Aunt Jeannie and then stunned, I glanced back at the amulet. Peering back at my Aunt, I asked her, &quot;How do you know and are you aware on what it can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, my Aunt held out her hand and then explained, &quot;I have a tale to tell you, if you'll listen,&quot; and then stood there, framed in the doorway, waiting for me to either take her hand or do what my said I should do - which was put the amulet back and go and play with Katherine.</p>
