<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What&#39;s with the smile?&quot; Nate asked Zeke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Zeke hadn&#39;t realized he&#39;d had such a mischievous smile on his face. He tried to play it off, but couldn&#39;t seem to do so. &quot;Oh, just thinking about something that happened last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be pretty good if your still thinking about it,&quot; Brad leaned in. &quot;Who was it? Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not telling,&quot; Zeke chuckled. He could tell Brad really wanted to know who he&#39;d gotten some from. Too bad it wasn&#39;t that. Yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright class,&quot; the bell rang and Ms. Donovan stood at the front of the class trying to get everyone&#39;s attention. Even though she was approaching her retirement, she still tried to do her best to teach her students. Her duty wasn&#39;t over until she actually signed those papers and was out of the class room. &quot;Take your seat.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone gave a begrudging, sigh. &quot;Later,&quot; Brad said, giving Zeke a friendly punch to the arm. <br />
<br />
Zeke shook his head and took his seat in the back of the class. He pulled out his notebooks and a pencil, along with the Chronivac as well. It hid underneath his notes but he could still use it pretty easily. Looking at his three test subjects though, they hadn&#39;t really changed yet. Danny&#39;s was expected as he didn&#39;t expect to notice much of anything till the end of the hour. Brad rolled his shoulders a bit as his shirt was probably getting a bit uncomfortable. But Nate. He seemed to be shifting around in his seat a bit more than usual. His eyes were glancing around a bit more, not really paying attention to anything. Zeke decided to help him focus on the lesson a bit more.<br />
<br />
He opened up the Chronivac, typing in Ms. Donovan&#39;s name. Her profile popped up instantly. Obviously the first thing he was going to change was age. There was no way in hell someone like Nate would think a 66 year old was hot. He dropped her age down to 26. Then he moved onto dropping her weight, adding to her breast size just a tad, then made sure that she was a bit athletic. But then there was one more option he didn&#39;t quite expect. &#39;Clothing choice.&#39; It was set to &#39;professional&#39; right now. Which made sense, Ms. Donovan never showed off any skin. <br />
<br />
But there was another option. &#39;Professionally sexy.&#39; Then clicked enter. Ms. Donovan paused as she looked over Zeke, but brushed it off. The jock was known for joking around and as long as it wasn&#39;t disruptive, she wasn&#39;t about to do anything about it. She turned back to the board and kept on teaching. <br />
<br />
At first the changes were barely noticeable. Just a bit more color to her curly hair. But then that same hair was starting to grow out a bit longer. The curls disappearing as long brown hair drifted down to her shoulders. Then it was the weight starting to shape up. She was losing quite a bit of it, but still maintained her wide curves. As she turned around again, her shirt was a bit more open. Open enough to show off her cleavage. But what Zeke didn&#39;t expect was seeing a necklace that seemed to hang down between her breasts, almost emphasizing them a bit more. <br />
<br />
Nate seemed to be having more trouble now. His attention was fully on Ms. Donovan, but his mind was clearly elsewhere. He&#39;d started grinding his legs together as the teacher went into a more &#39;MILF&#39; status. Even as she spoke, there was more confidence, but also an airy, almost sensual way she would emphasize certain words. But she kept getting younger. Wrinkles disappeared. Her body tightened up. And with each year added to her life again, another centimeter disappeared from her skirt. The fabric clung tightly to her curves, making it impossible to see her wide hips. <br />
<br />
The buttons on her shirt seemed to pop open just a bit more, showing off even more of her cleavage whenever she spun around. There was also a bit more confidence in the way she stood in the front of the class. A hand always seemed to be placed on her thrust out hip, while the other was writing on the white board or holding a book. It helped keep the boys attention.<br />
<br />
&#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; Nate&#39;s leg wouldn&#39;t stop bouncing. He squirmed in his desk as he felt like he was ready to explode. Just looking at Ms. Donovan seemed to be doing a lot for him. His dick was already hard, running down his left leg. &quot;Ms... Ms. Donovan?&quot; Nate stammered a bit. He was having so much difficulty thinking, let alone speaking. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; the teacher turned around and leaned against the podium in front of her. Her cleavage all the more prominent as her arms pushed her breasts closer together. &quot;What could I do for you Nate?&quot; <br />
<br />
A shiver ran down Nate&#39;s spine. He felt his cock throb at the seductive way she spoke. &quot;I--&quot;<br />
<br />
His words were cut off as she took long conscious strides to be by his desk. Her heels clicked with each step as she stood next to him. A arm wrapping around his shoulder, while her sharp red nails gently ran against his face. &quot;If you&#39;re having trouble with something, I&#39;m here to help. This stuff can be so rough but that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. To show you the ins and outs and everything in between. Hmm?&quot; She continued running her hands over his body.<br />
<br />
Nate felt his body buck. The gentle but commanding way she touched him was getting to be more than he could handle. His mind was all over the place and not even thinking about his hard dick anymore. &quot;Can... Can I go to the bathroom?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Ms. Donovan&#39;s hands ran up his chest. &quot;Hurry back. Class is almost over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Nate grunted. He tried his best to hide his boner, but it wasn&#39;t working all that well as he limped out of the classroom. It was an even worse as he walked down the hallway. Even without anyone there, he still felt like all eyes were on him. And more embarrassing was just how much his 18 year old hormones were raging. And for his teacher no less! <br />
<br />
He finally made it to the bathroom and went to the furthest stall. &quot;Oh God...&quot; he whined as he pulled his cock out. It was harder than it&#39;d been in a long time. He hadn&#39;t done anything with it for months. And now it would go down. &quot;Just think about anything else. Think about church. Think about God. Think about...&quot; His mind flashed back to his teacher. The seductive way she walked. The sensual way she talked. The way her hands ran down his chest while shoving his face into her perky breasts.<br />
<br />
There was no stopping it. The moment his hand touched his cock, it released all over the bathroom stall. Load after load shot onto the cheap grey dividers and coated them with a fresh coat of white. His body continued to jerk as every bit of what he&#39;d been saving over the last month had released at once. &quot;Shit. Fuck. Damn it,&quot; he cursed as he saw the mess he&#39;d made. &quot;I...&quot; for some reason he was trying to defend himself to his Lord and Savior but didn&#39;t know how. Nature had take it&#39;s course.<br />
<br />
Nate went to the toilet paper and started cleaning up the mess he made. In his fear and embarrassment, he didn&#39;t notice the changes to his body. Muscle was rapidly adding onto him. His shoulders grew just a tiny bit wider. As his arms filled his sleeves just a bit more. His chest tightened up. And he had a bit of trouble getting his shorts back up over his butt. But nothing that would make him stop. Instead he flushed his embarrassment down the toilet, and hurried off to second period as the bell rang.</p>
