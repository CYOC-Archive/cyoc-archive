The boy smiled and waited for the changes to begin. After about 10 seconds, he noticed his shirt began to feel a bit tight on him. He tried repositioning his shirt, but it didn&#39;t seem to alleviate the feeling any. He frowned and furrowed his brows, as the Chronivac had already erased his memory of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is my shirt so tight all of a sudden?&quot; he muttered to himself. He scratched his chest, but something felt off about it. It seemed to be a bit... harder than usual. Confused and slightly concerned, he exited his room and walked down the hall to the bathroom. Locking the door behind him, he quickly tore off the shirt to relieve the pressure, resting it on the bathroom counter. Looking in the mirror, he tried to determine what was wrong with him, but all he saw was his usual body: a bit of muscle on his chest and arms, yes, but it was nothing strange. Just then, a strange tingle went across his entire body and he shivered involuntarily. He felt an odd pulling feeling on his back, legs, and arms, and his chest started to feel a bit heavy. Once the tingle had passed, he opened his eyes again and gaped at what he saw. In the mirror was an older looking boy, probably around 16 years of age. His chest had grown a bit of hair around his navel, and if that weren&#39;t strange enough, it was the wrong color, too! His hair was blond, not brown! In addition, he didn&#39;t remember his nipples being quite that far apart. Granted, he didn&#39;t remember the area around them being raised off of his chest either....<br />
<br />
Another tingle appeared, this time in his head. He closed his eyes tightly, and once it had passed, he opened them, shaking his head. Now, what was he doing again? Right, he was looking for anything going on with his body. He took another look in the mirror, but yet again, he didn&#39;t see anything wrong. Same brown hair, same treasure trail that fanned out slightly onto his upper chest, same light beard that ran across the sides of his face.... He smiled slightly to himself. He had been so excited when his facial hair began to come in when he was 15, and now that he was nearly 17, he had to say that his body had certainly improved. His arms and legs had finally begun to fill in with some muscle, and the hair on them had begun to darken. He wished he were a bit taller though, considering his 5&#39;8&quot; stature wasn&#39;t really all that great. Something seemed off about that, though... wasn&#39;t he 14? And he was pretty sure that his hair was a different color.... He shook his head again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, what is wrong with me?&quot; The voice that had come out of his throat also sounded wrong--it was much deeper than it should have been--but he knew that it was just his regular old voice. Throughout this slight confusion, Trevor had neglected to notice that he had grown yet again, coming to his full height of 5&#39;11&quot;. His arms had grown too, for his biceps and triceps now nicely bulged out of his upper arms. His brain was also beginning to gain the knowledge of everything he should have learned in high school. He stood straight, allowing him to see the full extent of his changes thus far--not that he really knew that he was changing, of course. To him, his 19-year-old body seemed as it always did. He was about to head off to college in another couple of months, and as one might expect, he was very excited. Just then, the tingling returned, but now it was in his lower body.<br />
<br />
Trevor noticed just how tight his pants had begun to feel on him, so he quickly discarded them, revealing his lower half. Nothing seemed wrong about it, though. Fairly muscular legs, an average coating of hair on them... nothing was out of the ordinary. In fact, the only thing that felt off was his crotch, but that was only when the tingle washed over it, followed by a slight dropping sensation in both parts of his genitals. A quick check under the hood confirmed that nothing was wrong there. He still had a lingering feeling that nothing about this was normal at all, though. Before he could react on that, though, a feeling of vertigo overtook him as more knowledge, this time from four years&#39; worth of college courses, flooded his brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, what&#39;s wrong with me tonight?&quot; he muttered again, grasping his forehead. &quot;Come on, Trevor, pull yourself together!&quot; His hair retracted a bit into his head as he said this, the lost hair seeming to come out on his upper lip in the form of light, brown stubble. Almost as if to test that nothing was wrong mentally, he began reciting basic facts to himself. &quot;My name is Trevor...Trevor...Rollins?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;No, no, that&#39;s wrong.... Come on, think, think!&quot; After another few moments of concentration, he finally got it. &quot;Parker! Parker!&quot; he shouted, slapping his forehead. &quot;God, what is going on? Okay, so my name is Trevor Parker, I&#39;m 22 years old&quot;--here, the feeling of nothing being right came back again, but he shoved it aside--&quot;and I&#39;m currently single. There, that wasn&#39;t so hard.&quot; <br />
<br />
As he went to put on his clothes, which had morphed into a plain tan shirt and a pair of men&#39;s cargo shorts just moments before, the last changes took place. His short hair brushed itself forward, flicking itself upward towards the front, and his body aged a few more years. His eyes changed from blue to green, and any hair that had yet to appear on his body grew in. A wave seemed to rush over his body as the last of his muscle development took place. His mind accumulated memories of job experience after graduating from college, and any memories of his old life that remained were promptly overwritten. Lastly, he remembered meeting the love of his life, Miranda Rollins, last year on an online dating website. They had been together ever since. Taking one last look at his 27-year-old self in the mirror, Trevor walked out of the bathroom a new man.</p>
