<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sage Mallory arrived at 1313 Forandring Street (an odd name that reminded her vaguely of <br />
something from one of Professor Tolkien's books).  It was a two-story building divided <br />
into a several suites, perfect for small businesses.<br />
<br />
The advertisement hadn't said which suite she should go to, but there was a sign inside <br />
telling test subjects to go to the second floor.<br />
<br />
Sage was 22, with fair skin and auburn hair cut boyishly short.  She wore a black eyepatch <br />
over her right eye, and there was a faint scar visible behind it; her remaining eye was dark <br />
green in color.   A slender girl with small breasts, Sage was was quite tall; even wearing a <br />
pair of faded sneakers, she was 6' 1&quot;, with long arms and legs.  She was wearing a pair of <br />
men's sweatpants, an old Metallica concert t-shirt, and a brown leather jacket.<br />
<br />
Climbing the stairs to the second floor, she saw the door to Suite 11 was propped open.  <br />
Poking her head inside, she saw an attractive woman in her early 30's seated behind a <br />
desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, is this the place for the test subjects?&quot;  Sage's voice was very soft, and even <br />
when she spoke up, most people had a difficult time hearing her.  Fortunately, the older <br />
woman didn't seem to have any problems, and smiled warmly at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Miss, have a seat.  My name is Marcy Grey, and yes, I am interviewing test <br />
subjects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage took a seat, glad that the leather chair was on the large side.  &quot;I'm Sage, Sage <br />
Mallory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A pleasure to meet you, Miss Mallory.  Are you alright?  You look a bit depressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage looked away.  &quot;I...sorry, I'll be fine.  It's a long story.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy shook her head, and got up to close the door, locking it before she took her seat <br />
behind the desk.  &quot;Nonsense, it's been a slow morning, and I hate to see such a pretty girl <br />
looking so sad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty?  Me?  Um...if you say so.&quot;  Sage didn't often hear compliments about her <br />
appearance.  There had been a few people who'd said she was cute, but after what had <br />
happened, she felt anything but.<br />
<br />
Marcy just smiled.  Sage started to talk, despite herself.  Marcy was an excellent listener, <br />
she let Sage talk at her own pace.  The words just spilled out, things Sage would normally <br />
never tell anyone.<br />
<br />
She wasn't sure when she first realized she was different than other girls.  It didn't really <br />
occur to her until 8th grade that she wasn't interested in boys.  Oh sure, some of them <br />
were cute, but she vastly preferred the company of her own gender.  Then one day, while <br />
watching the girl's volleyball team play, she found herself staring intently at the athletic <br />
bodies of the young athletes....and being aroused by them.<br />
<br />
She tried to deny her feelings, and kept her secret until her first year of college, when, <br />
during a party, one of her dorm-mates, Bethany, made a pass at her.  At first, it was <br />
wonderful, Bethany understood how she felt, and she didn't have to hide who she was. <br />
<br />
Sex with another girl was better than she'd ever thought it could be.<br />
<br />
But after two months of bliss, Sage found out that Bethany didn't love her at all.  The <br />
betrayal, and the subsequent breakup was brutal.  In tears, Sage wandered the campus in <br />
a fugue, not even caring about the December cold.<br />
<br />
And that's when she'd met Skye.<br />
<br />
Sage couldn't move anymore, and she'd almost collapsed in a park bench.  It was so cold, <br />
she knew she was dying.  And she didn't care.  Everything was starting to go black when <br />
something warm was wrapped around her, and she heard a sweet voice, begging her to <br />
live.  Next thing she knew, she was at the hospital, and there was a hand holding hers.<br />
<br />
An angel had saved her life.  <br />
<br />
Skye certainly looked the part, with her long, pale blonde hair, and royal blue eyes.  She <br />
was the most beautiful girl Sage had ever met.  Skye visited Sage every day, bringing her <br />
food and talking to her as if they'd been friends forever.  Even though she was only 15, <br />
Skye was very smart and mature for her age, and she helped Sage mend her broken heart.<br />
<br />
Skye didn't even blink when Sage told her that she was a lesbian.  &quot;Well why would that <br />
matter, Sage?  It doesn't make you any different to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Theirs was a strange friendship, but Skye's parents treated Sage like a family member, and <br />
the two girls were nearly inseperable, despite their difference in ages.<br />
<br />
Sage was in love, but she denied it.  Skye was too young, it wouldn't, couldn't, be right.  <br />
But the younger girl had different ideas.  The night of her sixteenth birthday party, Skye <br />
confronted her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sage...don't you like me?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I...um..of course, you're my best friend.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Skye had sighed, then unbuttoned her shirt, revealing her perfect breasts.  &quot;I like you more <br />
than that, Sage.  I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage had protested, but Skye silenced her by placing her fingers over the older girl's lips.  <br />
&quot;If you don't feel that way about me, Sage, that's ok.  I'm happy to be your little sister.  But <br />
don't lie to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way she had looked at Sage, with tears in her eyes...Sage felt her resolve melt away, <br />
and she gave into her desires, pulling the smaller girl into her arms.<br />
<br />
It was Skye's first kiss, and much more.  Sage had felt guilty about it, but Skye wouldn't <br />
have any of it.  &quot;It was my choice, Sage, mine.  And don't say I'm not old enough to know <br />
what I'm doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Skye turned 18, she moved in with Sage, and the two of them were happy.<br />
<br />
Then, three months ago, they had an accident with a hit-and-run driver.  Sage lost her <br />
eye, but Skye was put into a coma...one that the doctors said she'd never wake up from.<br />
<br />
It was too painful to see her lover laying in the hospital bed, like a broken doll.  <br />
<br />
For the second time in her life, Sage wanted to die.<br />
<br />
Sage finally fell quiet, looking down, unable to stop crying.  That's when she felt Marcy's <br />
arms wrap around her, the older girl hugging her tightly from behind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Skye is running out of time, and you have nothing to lose, that's why you're here.  I think <br />
we can help each other, Sage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sage had to sign a lot of forms, and submit to a full medical examination.  She hated <br />
revealing the scars on her body, but Marcy was there the whole time.<br />
<br />
Finally, she was ready to begin the program.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sage, dear, we have several drugs we're wanting to test.  I'll let you choose which one <br />
you'd like to test for us.&quot;</p>
