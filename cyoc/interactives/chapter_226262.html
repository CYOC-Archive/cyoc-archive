<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“……in international news; the Prime Minister of India met with the new President of Iran. Iran faced a major upheaval when the Fury flu forced the theocratic government to embrace radical changes that were in direct contradiction to the teaching or the Koran and that of the former ayatollah…”<br />
<br />
Julian turned the television off. “Always something new,” she smiles as she rises from the sofa; her feline tail twitching as Julian stretches from her nap. Waiting for Edward to come home from work now that she was a fury was always interesting. Finding it fun and erotic to hide from him and either let him sniff her out or too pounce him from behind. Currently the anthro cougar fury contemplated whether to jump him from the linen closet or let him pin her to the stairs as he spears her with his lupine rocket. Her thoughts were interrupted as she sees a couple unread messages on her phone. Picking it up off the coffee table she gasps.<br />
“Brittany gave birth! And I napped through it,” Julian commenting; her sadness at missing the event turned to joy as she see a picture of the two cubs sleeping in Brittany’s arms. Both swaddled in a type of natural cloth that doesn’t irritate a fury’s fur; Julian smiles as she reads that the charcoal grey wolf cub fury is named Dusk; a boy and the first born. While the doe cub fury was named Dawn; “how fitting,” Julian chuckling.”<br />
<br />
Julian putting down her phone heads to the kitchen; she wanted to make a celebratory cake to welcome the two new cubs into the world. While they would be unable to eat it; Julian knew that Brittany and Jake would not hesitate to enjoy a slice along with friends and family.<br />
“Now what would be the perfect cake,” Julian summoning a cook book thanks to her magic runes. Reading through the recipes she decided on a simple layered cake with a special two color icing.<br />
“But I need some ingredients at the store,” Julian nodding as she quickly writes down a note for her husband in case he gets home while she is out.<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
At the local grocery store, Jillian smiles as she observes several fury’s like herself walking about unconcerned with being nude; exposing themselves as they go about their days, all sporting happy expressions as they revel in their fury forms. Julian nods at a male Egyptian Mau fury with a female capybara fury as they chuckle over the Parsnips and carrots that look like a horse’s cock. Going so far as to try and use them as a sex toy before a store employee caught them and make it clear they need to pay for it, if they want to play with it.<br />
<br />
Julian smirks as the couple feels like they were denied their cookie while she makes a bee line to the baking isle. Picking up the ingredients for her cake, flour, baking soda, chocolate, vanilla and few others. Julian decides to also pick up a few other items. Heading to the butcher, Julian looks at the display case and salivates at the assorted cuts of beef. Signalling to the butcher and selecting two sirloin rib eye steaks; Julian then sighs as she has to head back to the produce section. Picking up some mushrooms and spinach, she pauses as she spots something new and novel.<br />
“Fiddlehead greens,” Julian remarking as she examines the curiously shaped fern fronds.<br />
“Just fry them up with some butter and salt,” the same store employee she saw admonishing the prior vegetable toy couple; “they will go well with the mushrooms you got.”<br />
“Interesting,” Julian thinking about the dinner she was planning; “something new to try I guess.”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Back at home from her grocery trip, the anthro cougar fury hummed as she entered the kitchen with her purchases. Putting the cake ingredients away, Julian begins to fry up the steaks as she preps the mushrooms and spinach. Putting the steaks into the oven to finish cooking, she adds butter to the still hot pan and tosses the fiddleheads and starts fry them before tossing in the mushrooms. Putting them on a low heat, Julian opens up the fridge to pull out some radishes she bought earlier along with a vinaigrette. Mixing the two with the spinach to make a simple salad, then putting it back into the fridge.<br />
<br />
Julian goes back to her cook book and looks at the cake she is going to make later. A simple layer cake with frosting; Julian wants to mix it up. Planning to make one layer a rich chocolate while the other being a delicate vanilla sponge. Separated with a simple layer of frosting, Julian turns the page and smiles<br />
“Fondant icing,” Julian nodding as she puts down the book and checks on the steaks; “and a yin yang pattern is just the perfect. But that will have to wait,” Julian closing the cook book; nodding as she is happy with her decision. “Now where is Edward?”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
Edward Heartpaw was at the hospital visiting the happy couple as they rested between congratulatory visits. Having a chance to see the new cubs and chatting with his daughter who was also well along with her pregnancy; Edward was clearly having visions of his mate Julian filled with his seed and belly swollen with life. The fantasy was so vivid he started to grow an erection as he observed the many sleeping newborns.<br />
“Dad,” Allison poking her anthro fox fury father; “stow that prick. We are in a hospital.”<br />
“Oh,” Edward looking down to see himself already at half-mast. While nudity is acceptable in public, flagrant displays of one’s genitals is frowned upon in public settings. “I’m having urges of planting my seed in your mother,” Edward smiling; “all these cubs, and i want mine to be added to the nursery here.”<br />
“Give it time dad,” Allison hugging her father; “let’s head home and give Brittany and Jake some quiet time.”<br />
“Okay,” Edward nodding as he walks out with his daughter; placing a hand paw on her belly, trying to feel a kick or any movement.<br />
“He is sleeping,” Allison answering; “you missed the action earlier.”<br />
“You’re having a son,” Edward looking at his daughter with surprised happiness.<br />
“You can’t tell mom,” Allison responding; “I want it to be a surprise at the baby shower.”<br />
“I think I can keep that one,” Edward smiling at the knowledge that he will have a grandson in a few months.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
After the short yet quiet drive home, Edward watches as his daughter walks to the house next to his and Julian’s. Jimmy Proudhoof purchased the place from the bank back before the fury flu shut down the world and he and Allison have been living in it since. Having his daughter next door was a relief as she and Jimmy went about making a few modifications and tweeks to the interior. Wanting to have as much natural light, they got skylights installed in every bedroom and made the windows larger. This resulted in them upgrading the duct work to handle the extra cooling required in the summer and heat in the winter. They also installed a bidet in the master bathroom and expanded the shower by sacrificing space from the master closet; a room that no longer has a purpose as fury’s don’t have a use for clothing or a place to store it.<br />
<br />
Edward enters his home and instantly salivates at the smell of freshly cooked steaks wafting throughout the house.<br />
“Oooh that smells good,” Edward tossing his keys at the nearby bowl. Magically locking the door with a simple wave, he heads to the kitchen to see Julian waiting for him.<br />
“Late day at work,” Julian watching her husband as he grabs some plates; wanting to help with diner in some way.<br />
“I stopped at the hospital to see Dusk and Dawn,” Edward turning to look at his wife; “it got me thinking about us.”<br />
“Oh,” Julian taking the rib-eye steaks off of the pan after giving them a brown butter basting; placing the steaks on the plates along with the sautéed mushrooms and fiddleheads. Then getting the spinach and radish salad chilling in the fridge.<br />
“It made me think about us having another child,” Edward sitting at the table, looking at Julian; “it made me think about watching your belly get big with a cub growing in you.”<br />
“You want to be a father again,” Julian’s heart beat increasing; her pulse quickening as she felt her sex quiver with excitement.<br />
“Its not as if we haven’t been half trying already,” Edward cutting into the steak and taking a modest bite; admiring how it is at that perfect medium rare then taking a maw full of the mushrooms and fiddleheads.<br />
“These are different,” Edward finding the texture and taste of the fiddleheads enticing; “what are they?”<br />
“Fiddleheads,” Julian feeling flushed; “and what do you mean by half trying already?”<br />
<br />
Edward smiles as he puts down his cutlery and gets up to grab a drink. Selecting a beer from the fridge, he offers one to Julian who waves a hand paw in polite refusal.<br />
“We practically rut every night before bed,” Edward taking a sip as he sits back down; guiding his tail through the open back of the chair. “While you are taking your heat suppression pills,” Edward looking at Julian slyly; “it’s not as if you can’t not stop taking them and let nature take its course.”<br />
Julian exhaled heavily at her mate’s suggestion over diner; she was also having these yearnings after becoming a fury. Feeling herself reinvigorated, she felt as if her youth was restored and that she had a second chance at another child. “We should finish diner, if we want to go straight to dessert,” Julian giving Edward a lewd grin.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Julian Heartpaw was stunned at how fast Edward was at pinning her to the floor after supper was over. Feeling him on top of her as he mounted her and started probing her entrance with his rock hard rod. She moans as he spears her and begins to jackhammer her tunnel with wild animistic abandon. His hand paws gripping her abdomen as he feels his shaft moving in and out of her while thrusting his hips; his knot getting closer to her feline cookie.<br />
<br />
Julian moans as her breasts swing in time to the thrusting; her body instinctively shifting her hips to allow him deeper access. Gasping as she feels his knot stretching her to her limit. It was a feeling she still has yet to get use to as his thrusts now became short and furious.<br />
“I’m going to cum soon,” Edward growling as he pants.<br />
“Do it,” Julian moaning in return; “breed me!”<br />
“Arrrg,” Edward grunts as he bites Julian’s ear; making a final thrust as he explodes and feels the seed churning in his balls shoot through his vulpine cock and sprays Julian’s hungry womb.<br />
“oooooooooooooo,” Julian howling as her eyes roll up; her body orgasming as she feels the foreign shaft pumping baby batter into her. Julian’s body eagerly drinking up every drop as she shudders in orgasmic ecstasy.<br />
<br />
“No more heat suppression pills,” Edward enjoying pressing his fury body into his mate’s as he continues to unload his seed into her. “Let’s make a cub together.”<br />
“Yes,” Julian muttering as she waits for her lover’s knot to deflate; “and we do this at least twice a day. Mornings and nights.”<br />
“In the shower,” Edward nuzzling the cougar fury below; “over a table, in the garage. No place home is safe from my touch.”<br />
“Just not in the kitchen,” Julian adding; “let’s keep this area as a rut free zone.”<br />
“But this is the best kind of dessert to have,” Edward whispering as he playfully nibbles Julian’s ear.<br />
“No sex in the kitchen,” Julian responding; adding a growl to make her point clear, “This moment while enjoyable shall be a one off in this room.”<br />
“Spoil sport,” Edward guiding Julian to a spooning position as he waits for his knot to soften.<br />
“I need to bake a celebratory cake later,” Julian staring at the gap between to floor and the stove; seeing dirt under appliance, she makes a mental note to give the floors a good mopping tomorrow.</p>
