<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon’s tail eventually stopped growing, leaving his tail very long, but still strong and muscular. Unlike his initial dream, Damon was able to move thanks to the water around him carrying his weight easily.<br />
<br />
When he was done growing his tail, Damon was impressed. When he first had the dream of his tail growing, it terrified him. He was so used to the length of his tail being the way it was that seeing it grow freaked him out. But now seeing his tail as big as it was felt a bit... empowering. <br />
<br />
Charlotte was enchanted by this. Even though it’s not often explicitly spoken in the Merkingdom, the length of fish tails often serve as a visual signal that the long-tailed merperson is healthy and an ideal partner to breed with due to their strong genetics. Just like how humans have their subtle biological ways of defining healthy people by height, breast size, and facial features using genetics from evolution - merfolk have the same things as well.  <br />
<br />
Damon didn’t realize it, he grew up being a human after all, but he just made himself much more appealing to Charlotte than ever before. <br />
<br />
For all her life, Charlotte grew up with a beautiful body, causing her to feel isolated once her parents forced her to marry a merman. But now she found Damon with a handsome body she considers to match her own. For the first time in what felt like forever, she didn’t feel alone with her body, she finally felt like an equal with Damon.<br />
<br />
“So, how do I  look?”, Damon said as he picked up the end of his tail and flapped his tail fins, grinning. <br />
<br />
“You look… Amazing.”, Charlotte said with awe in her voice. <br />
<br />
She stroked her husband’s scales, they were a marvel to touch - especially since there were more of them thanks to Damon’s increased tail size. She made her way from the tips of her husband&#39;s tail fins to where his scales joined with his skin. Charlotte eagerly stroked and touched Damon’s waist, her mermaid tail beating against his. <br />
<br />
Damon absolutely loved the sensations of his incredibly smooth scales, moaning and cooing as his wife was tender and loving in stroking his entire lower body. His tail fins flapped and flapped as he started to feel… something. <br />
<br />
As a prince who grew up with older brothers and a strict mother, Damon never really had a chance to feel this… oddity within him. He never really got to ever experience what it was like to have such feelings for a girl at his age, but he was suddenly feeling this pleasure within him now, he was aroused. <br />
<br />
As he became more and more aroused, he could feel layers of scales at his groin move as they made way for something. Damon and Charlotte stopped to see that thing emerge from his crotch, it was his penis.<br />
<br />
It was long, hard, and covered in beautiful scales. Damon was shocked, he had never seen such an intimate part of himself changed into something like this before. His newly mermadic penis even had tiny soft fins and frills - looking almost nothing like the soft pink organ he used to have. <br />
<br />
Charlotte could see Damon’s face and comforted him, “It’s okay, Damon. It’s normal for merman to have something like this. Merfolk often have their sex organs covered by layers of scales in order to keep them hidden.”<br />
<br />
“Really? I had no idea...”, the prince said.<br />
<br />
Charlotte nodded. “Yup. It’s part of our anatomical design. When a merperson increasingly gets aroused, their privates push the protective scales more and more until they’re out and about, just like your little friend over here.” she said as poked and prodded Damon’s dick.<br />
<br />
Damon was fascinated and loved the touch of his dick by his wife&#39;s hands, but he still felt a bit embarrassed. “Oh man, sorry if I weirded you out for a bit by having my dick pop out like this.”<br />
<br />
Charlotte giggled, “As I said, it’s fine, Damon.”. The princess bowed her head and gave his penis a little kiss, causing Damon to blush, but smile in comfort. “In fact, my little… Flower is starting to get impatient herself.” Charlotte said as she looked away and blushed.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, Damon couldn’t understand what Charlotte meant until he saw movement from her crotch. Her groin started to have little sporadic movements as the protective scales on the area were starting to move and allow room for something.<br />
<br />
Charlotte closed her eyes and left a soft moan as her vagina finally revealed itself to Damon. <br />
<br />
Her damp womanhood glistened as Damon’s eyes looked at it with awe. It looked delicate and soft, yet tantalizing and appealing - just like Charlotte herself.<br />
<br />
When Charlotte opened her eyes, she looked to see her husband staring directly at her clitoris in wonder. She smiled.<br />
<br />
Throughout her life, Charlotte has always loved her body, including her lovely vagina. Many mermen have tried to claim her womanhood and own her body, but she always refused each and every single one… Except for Damon - the one merman who she truly loved and happily married. She was more than glad to give her heart, body, and soul to Damon, and was genuinely honored to have her dear husband be the one to take her virginity. <br />
<br />
No words were said, the couple knew what to do next once their privates were showed to each other. <br />
<br />
Damon’s mermadic penis penetrated Charlotte’s vagina, moans emerged from the two as waves of pleasure embraced the two married lovers. <br />
<br />
“Oohh. Y–Yes, Don’t stop, Damon. Please… please be my merman.” she whispered. <br />
<br />
“My pleasure”, Damon says as he grabs Charlotte’s shoulders and kisses her in the mouth. Charlotte moaned harder as her breasts pressed against Damon’s chest and Damon’s long tail wrapped around hers.<br />
<br />
Damon’s tail fins went inside Charlotte’s strawberry blonde hair and wiggled playfully, prompting Charlotte to laugh in pleasure. Damon, seeing the joy he gave to his wife, stroked and poked her belly, causing her to laugh even more.<br />
<br />
“Hahaha! Mmm. God yes, Damon! You’re perfect!”, Charlotte moaned as she smiled. <br />
<br />
Damon humped harder as he heard those words, he felt all powerful and ate up all of the compliments his beautiful wife gave him. <br />
<br />
It’s crazy how he went from a young hopeful human prince simply wanting peace between humans and merfolk to a powerful married merman having sex with the princess of the entire ocean. <br />
<br />
The feeling was awesome, everything Damon had hoped sex would be and so, so much more. The mermaid princess’ pussy was tight around his large and scaly shaft, and the instinctual thrusts of the hips combined with the gentle clenches from Charlotte’s vaginal muscles were sure to make Damon orgasm soon - but for now, he just wanted it to last just a little while longer. <br />
<br />
Damon ran his hand through Charlotte’s scales, rubbed his muscular tail against hers, brushed his hand through her hair, and finally grabbed her breasts. <br />
<br />
Charlotte felt like she was in heaven. The pleasure was almost overwhelming. She was once told by her mother growing up that she would one day feel like she could fly once Charlotte found a merman to love - and now she had truly understood what her mother meant by that. Charlotte’s eyes watered as she processed what has happened to her - after so many years of feeling alone, she had finally found the man of her dreams, and he was going to rule the entire ocean right beside her, all because he looked back at her at a marketplace. Love truly comes from the most unexpected of places. <br />
<br />
And with that, Damon allowed himself to climax, and for the first time, he felt something hot and sticky race up the length of his cock and into Charlotte’s vagina - officially taking his wife&#39;s virginity once and for all.<br />
<br />
The lovers shared a large moan of pure pleasure as they both fell on their sides of the bed and took a breath. Their respective private organs were eventually reclaimed by the protective scales before being neatly covered by the layers once again. <br />
<br />
Damon felt amazing, sex with a real mermaid princess! To think, he once thought merfolk were just myths when he first discovered their race in books. What a wild, yet poetic, chain of events it was for him. He looked at his wife in pride and gently brushed her hair.<br />
<br />
Charlotte looked back and smiled. It seemed surreal to her that she could find love with a merman who was born a part of the human race she once despised, but here he was -  right in bed with her and his ring on her finger. She was truly grateful for Damon for being at her side right when she needed someone the most in her life. The words that left her lips were of deep passion that proved to her husband that they were bound together forever. <br />
<br />
“I love you, Damon.”<br />
<br />
“I love you, Charlotte.”<br />
<br />
The married couple cuddled each other and kissed until their tired bodies sent them to a pleasant nap. <br />
<br />
Life was good.</p>
