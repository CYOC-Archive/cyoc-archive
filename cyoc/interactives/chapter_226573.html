<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David wrote &quot;Jason&#39;s grandfather was huge Korean bodybulder, but his grandmother was white and she hide the truth. The genes of his ancestor starts hitting him two weeks before his birthday. His weight will increase 25 pounds per day and his height will increase 1 inch per day until his 21 birthday. His penis will increase 1 inch a day, and his testicles will increase 1/2 an inch a day. If he will train with David his growth gonna be twice larger.&quot;<br />
When David was finished, the letters swirled on the page again. The next morning, Jason noticed his clothes were tight. His body felt odd, like his muscles were swollen. He thought that it was after effects of his gym session with David. This giant was lying naked and asleep next to him. Jason was about to wake up his lover in their standard way: licking and teasing David&#39;s enourmous dick. David opened one eye, smiled and pulled him close. &quot;How are you feeling little man?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Jason replied as David&#39;s hand stroked down Jason&#39;s side, &quot;a little sore from your workout.&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you notice any difference?&quot;<br />
Jason ran his hand through his hair and his hand felt larger, then his biceps were swollen, even his pecs felt fuller. David took his hand and gently felt his abs. Jason had always had great definition, but his abs were hard like steel under David&#39;s touch. David said  &quot;I believe we need to push you harder today, let&#39;s do a leg day&quot;<br />
Jason wasn&#39;t sure why David was pushing him, but he didn&#39;t question it. Jason thought he might need to focus harder today, but when he tried to put weight on his bar, the plates rattled. They weren&#39;t the standard weights for this station, David had brought out the plates for the station across from Jason&#39;s. &quot;Little man, we&#39;re working here,&quot; David said as he put another 25 on each end, bringing the bar total to 350 lbs. &quot;Today is all about building size.&quot;<br />
Jason didn&#39;t think he had that kind of strength, but he just did what David told him to do. After each set, David had him take a moment to feel his body. He was definitely getting bigger, bigger than he thought was possible. Shower and changing clothes. In the car David asked him to take a supper in his favorite Korean restaraunt. David was really into frying thin strips of pork and they dipped it into this sweet chile sauce. Jason agreed because he wanted to see David happy. In the restaraunt David ordered tons of food for them both. Jason felt hungry and didn&#39;t ask any questions, but he was really surprised how much he was able to eat. <br />
Next morning Jason woked up moaning. His body was hurting more than it should have, and it was the second morning in the row that his muscles were swollen and his clothes felt too tight. &quot;Fuck.&quot; he whispered. &quot;Why does every thing hurt so bad?&quot; David said, &quot;it&#39;s probably a delayed effect of your workout. But the good news is that your muscle growth spurt seems to have sped up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Muscle growth spurt? &quot; Jason said as he lifted the covers and saw a huge tent in the bedsheet. David smiled and kissed him and then took a small mirror from the nightstand drawer. He held the mirror above Jason&#39;s face, showing Jason how he looked. &quot;See all those changes.&quot; David said as he placed his hand on Jason&#39;s stomach,  David whispered &quot;you&#39;re gonna be such a huge fucking stud.&quot;<br />
&quot;I need to weight myself. Where is our scales?&quot; asked Jason. <br />
&quot;Oh, I damaged them. Let&#39;s do it after the workout today&quot; David replied. Jason thought it was strange. But then, the big stud decided not to waste more time. He got up to workout and had a long breakfast with David.<br />
After they both had their morning routines finished, David drove Jason to the gym. They both dressed for working out, but as usual Jason wore tight speedos. After all he loved teasing David as much as David loved the view. But the speedo didn&#39;t stay tight for too long. Jason couldn&#39;t help it and his cock got harder. His speedo looked like it was going to pop. He didn&#39;t notice his butt got bigger as well as his thighs. The bulge in the speedo was obscenely big, but Jason didn&#39;t care. David just loved it. &quot;We&#39;re gonna workout, but you&#39;re gonna have to get rid of the speedo, your big cock will just get in the way.&quot; he said with a huge grin on his face.<br />
At the gym David pushed him hard to train. He worked on chest and other pecs exercises. Jason&#39;s muscles felt so heavy and sore. But Jason was getting used to it. And then at the end of their session Jason noticed something odd. He wasn&#39;t as short as usual. When Jason looked at David and Steven he realized he was a little taller. But he didn&#39;t say anything, not even to David. He just looked down and felt his bigger feet and his thighs and butt were still sore. &quot;Why don&#39;t we go home to shower&quot; he heard David say.<br />
At the house they took their time showering. &quot;What&#39;s that, sir?&quot; asked Jason. David pointed at Jason&#39;s ass &quot;this? This is my finger little man, I think you need a stretching out today.&quot; Jason loved when David stretched him out, and he didn&#39;t want to disappoint. After they were cleaned up, they were making out on the bed. Jason totaly forgot about everything else in his life, as long as he could feel David&#39;s lips. &quot;You are the biggest and hottest guy ever&quot; he said to David. He pulled David&#39;s legs up so his feet were near his chest, then David spread his legs a little so he could look at Jason&#39;s gorgeous little body.<br />
&quot;You know you&#39;ve grown right?&quot; he asked Jason, while his huge fingers played with the hole in between his cheeks. Jason moaned in pleasure &quot;yes, yes I know... sir&quot; he panted, as David added the third finger &quot;You&#39;ve been working hard.&quot; &quot;Sir, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; &quot;I told you to take off your speedo, I think we have to buy new ones now.&quot; he replied as he entered the hole with the forth finger. Jason&#39;s eyes got wider, &quot;you are kidding right?&quot; he moaned. &quot;Nope&quot; said David. &quot;Why? Sir... you can see that my butt got bigger... and my thighs.&quot;<br />
David chuckled, &quot;It&#39;s not funny.&quot; said Jason with a sad expression &quot;I think the muscles got too big for my body.&quot; Jason wasn&#39;t wrong, the muscles he built over the last days got even more massive and he gained some weight, but not only his butt was bigger, but his whole body grew in proportion to the rest of him. Even his torso, his shoulders got bigger.<br />
He felt huge, he could easily bench 300 pounds, but that wasn&#39;t enough for his lover. David&#39;s cock penetrated deeper into Jason. Jason screamed with pleasure. His huge cock was deep inside the tight hole and they both were panting hard. David couldn&#39;t take it anymore &quot;I&#39;m cuming&quot; he said, while Jason&#39;s cock also erupted like a volcano, sending strings of white, thick cum on both of their bodies. They collapsed and just lied next to each other on the bed. David cuddled up and covered them with blanket. &quot;Good night my little man, sleep well.&quot; David said with a smile &quot;thank you sir...</p>
