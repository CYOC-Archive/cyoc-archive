<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the pieces in play and the game set in motion, you fade off into your ethereal plane to watch everything unfold that you just started. You were giddy with anticipation and incredibly eager to see how it all played out. Even the dark act of starting things down this path affected you, which you hadn&#39;t realized, as your godly form began to take on a dark and twisted visage. Now, all you did was stay with those two in their home, waiting and watching, sensing arousal in both of the males.<br />
<br />
With the gears going in both Duncan and Jake, both were eager to finally act upon their emotions and feelings after all of this time. It had been years for Jake... since he became sexually aware and active with solely himself, at the age of twelve to be specific, that Jake had a thing for men... including men like his dad... and even his dad. Then, just like earlier with God appearing before him and telling God the truth about how he saw his father&#39;s flaccid cock and it was pretty much game over for Jake. Since that very moment, Jake only had his eyes set on one man specifically... his father. He wanted to explore his father&#39;s body sexually with a great desire that seemed to be on the forefront of his mind anytime Duncan and Jake were together. Numerous times, too many to count, Jake had to adjust himself to keep his dad from noticing the erection that continuously wanted to show itself and give away his feelings to a man whom Jake had thought would never be within his reach. He didn&#39;t want to be just mates with his dad... no... he wanted to have the relationship remain as father and son, but being incestuous mates at the same time. Just thinking about it while he sat on the sofa, waiting for Duncan to walk through the door, made him as hard as a rock.<br />
<br />
Duncan only grinned to himself knowing that he was a few steps and moments from having the thing he wanted for so long. Duncan, however, wasn&#39;t as oblivious as Jake thought. He had seen the way his boy had looked at him. Duncan saw the need, the fervor and the hunger in the boy&#39;s eyes for his flesh, but never let Jake do it... even though Duncan desperately wanted to let his own flesh and blood have his way with him. He had written so many dark fantasies of becoming a werewolf, being intimate with his own kin and then corrupting them both becoming demonic creatures, forfeiting their eternal souls for pleasures of the flesh. Now, with the permission of God... even the ability and power to make those fantasies a reality... he was moments away from having exactly what he wanted. Duncan&#39;s face was plastered with a sinister grin thinking about his boy on his cock, suckling on it like a babe on its&#39; mother&#39;s teat, growing in different ways as he became more and more corrupt by the second. Duncan could feel his body reacting to the thoughts as his decently sized pecs seemed to plump up slightly while his nipples perked up, rubbing it against his policeman&#39;s uniform shirt, pleasuring him slightly as the sensitive skin was all the more teased. Duncan had to stifle a moan as his cock grew hard in his uniform&#39;s pants, brushing against fabric, only bringing him pleasure just like with his nipples. &quot;Fuck...&quot; Duncan moaned under his breath and stood at the door waiting for his body to calm down, thinking about anything other than what was just about to happen. &quot;Just calm down Duncan, you want the fun to between you and Jake... not with yourself as it had been so many times in the past... too many times to count.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Duncan willed himself to be in a normal state, he could feel his body yearning to be touched and played with, but he refrained even though it was somewhat painful to not give in and pleasure his flesh right then and there. The thing was, Duncan knew that he&#39;d get what he wanted for so long soon, so why do the pleasuring himself when his son would be doing it for him soon enough. Feeling calmed down, Duncan took in a deep breath and breathed out slowly while grasping the handle, turning it and opening the door which led directly into the living room where he could see Jake sitting on the sofa, watching something on the television. Hearing the door open, Jake&#39;s head turned and smiled at his father as dirty thoughts ran through the boy&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad! Glad you&#39;re home safe and sound! How was work?&quot; Jake said pleasantly as he got up and started walking over to him, wanting to plant a big hug on the older man.... but more to feel his father&#39;s body pressed up against his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh... pretty boring to be honest. Just did patrols all day, made a few appearances to calls, but nothing exciting like a chase or arresting a perp. How was your day at school Jake? Speaking of... how are you liking high school... have you found anyone of interest that you&#39;d want to date?&quot; Duncan asked, playing the role of the inquisitive father, while also wanting to know about things Jake didn&#39;t really ever talk about.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was school... pretty boring... just had class and all that. Considering that I&#39;ve been there for two years now and in my Junior year... I&#39;d have to say it really isn&#39;t all that bad. Nothing like shows on television made it out to be. As far as finding anyone to date... nah... no one in school.&quot; Jake answered truthfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... so you have someone in your sights, but they don&#39;t go to your school? So... is it a guy or a girl? What&#39;s his or her name?&quot; Duncan asked, prying the information from his son, knowing that he was too shy to ever come out and say it. It was something that came with time, being sure in one&#39;s self to just come out and say things like this... except in the case of underage incestual feelings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad...&quot; Jake whined, &quot;you know I don&#39;t like talking about these things. Why do you have to press it so much or so often?&quot; Jake replied, curious to know just what his father was up to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well... I was just wondering.&quot; Duncan said, smiling cheesily while raising his right arm and placing his right hand against the back of his head. &quot;I just want you to know you can always be honest with me, no matter what it is or what it is about. I love you son and I don&#39;t care if you are gay or straight. Hell... if you were gay, I could honestly say that the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake smiled as he got closer to his father and wrapped his arms around the bigger guy once their bodies were close enough to do so while enjoying touching him in his police officer uniform. &quot;D-dad...&quot; Jake said pausing, looking up to his father&#39;s eyes, &quot;you&#39;re telling me you are gay?&quot; He said quickly to end his astonished question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! Been gay my whole life. The one-night stand that I had with your mother those sixteen years ago or so was done in a drunken haze. Buddies got me so drunk I had no idea what I was doing or anything. Not too long after, she tells me she was pregnant with you and that you were my problem once you were born. I didn&#39;t care. I was happy and elated to know that I was going to be a dad... something I didn&#39;t think would ever actually happen because of my sexual orientation and never, did I ever consider you to be a &#39;problem&#39;. To me... you were a blessing!&quot; Duncan said in earnest as his eyes got all watery as his emotions began to run wild. &quot;So... are you gay Jake?&quot; Duncan made sure to ask, having a feeling he knew the answer all along, but just wanted to hear it from the boy&#39;s mouth so that they could both take their forbidden fantasy to the next level.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup...&quot; Jake answered trailing off as he felt the meat that brought him life, pressed up against his body, begin to swell and not only push against the confining fabric of his pants, but against his person in turn. &quot;... and it would seem a part of you is happy to hear that as well.&quot; Jake grinned as he cupped and stroked his father gingerly eliciting a manly moan out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck son... fuck yeah I am. You think you want to help your old man out with this... problem?&quot; He asked with a bit of a feral grin, feeling the dark energy within him to build and begin changing him from the inside.<br />
<br />
Without even saying a single word, Jake just continued his soft and gentle caresses of the confined swelling member as Duncan continued to moan. Knowing that it was his flesh and blood continued to fill him with dark energy, which in turn allowed him to continue to let go more and more, allowing his humanity to disappear and his newer animalistic and demonic self to come forth. Slowly Jake teased, feeling it grow even further, which planted a dark grin on his face as his father&#39;s emerging demonic energy was also effecting him. Jake couldn&#39;t help wanting to take it out and enjoy it, but at the same time he knew the timing wasn&#39;t right. He wanted his father to squirm; to moan out in the throes of blissful lust and then only then would he go further, only to increasingly intensify his father&#39;s lust.<br />
<br />
Under the clothe Jake could feel the turgid meat beg to at least be set free, feeling as though it wasn&#39;t going to be able to grow any more with being confined. It felt as though it had to be released to grow even bigger. All of this, however, was his father calling out to the boy to release him with his mind. Feeling obliged to obey, Jake grinned as he nuzzled against the bulge, sliding his smaller boyish hands against the bulging fabric and pulled down the zipper which allowed the engorged, yet contained, meat free to push out from the zipper hole. Jake grinned as he saw it... it was bigger than he remembered... or at least that&#39;s what he thought even though there was more to it than that. No... it was definitely bigger, but only slightly because of the dark energy within Duncan making it bigger, just by a bit, to satiate both his own fantasy and the known hunger his son had for thick cock. Duncan knew the truth about his son for a long time, especially since years ago he went to turn off the computer when Jake had fallen asleep one night and saw no only the saved images on the computer of coke can thick cock, but of the several websites people posted pics of their junk along with written fantasies involving thick meat. However, at the same time, what Duncan and Jake would become definitely came with much thicker junk than what either of them had currently. Placing his attention back upon his son, Duncan watched as Jake nuzzled it again... this time smearing a bit of wetness across his face from Duncan&#39;s continued and lengthened arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm... what&#39;s this?&quot; Duncan heard Jake moan in lustful curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I think you know exactly what that is Jake...&quot; Duncan replied with a wolfish grin.<br />
<br />
Jake only returned the grin, extending his tongue as far as he could from his open mouth and gave a very long lasting, sensual and erotic lick of the fluids and the meat. As soon as it touched his tongue Jake&#39;s eyes went wide as he not only felt that same demonic energy flow into him, but something immediately changed in him. He felt more dominant suddenly... more hungry for power... feeling as though he had a right to dominate his father and make him Jake&#39;s bitch. Though, at the same time, Jake immediately knew and remembered his place. He was the son of Duncan... the Alpha. Why the word &quot;Alpha&quot; sounded perfectly used, Jake did not know, but it remained all the same. &quot;Mmmmm... fuckin tasty Alpha...&quot; Jake moaned to his father as Duncan looked down again, noticing that just in that little bit... Jake&#39;s ears had taken on a slightly tipped look to it while his body not only looked slightly more built, but his body hair increased ever so slightly along with his face looking a tiny bit more rugged.<br />
<br />
Duncan just grinned and thought to himself, not realizing that his own body took on the same slight features, &quot;Looks like the wolf is going to make its appearance in you soon and our pack will begin to form just as our Lord wanted!&quot;</p>
