<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was finally going to get another turn. His hard-on was still driving him crazy. He had given up on winning the game. He was a bit put off by Jemima bringing a boy home. To make it worse he was the 15 year old work experience kid from work. If he had known this Miles kid had the hots for his beautiful daughter he would never have given him the job. Anyway he needed to get this game finished. He rolled a 5. It moved him to a space that said &#39;Libido&#39;. What sort of family game is this he thought. The voice said &#39;More or less?&quot; he looked at Miles and Jemima. &quot;Less&quot; he said then passed the dice on to Jemima. Little did he know he had just turned his own libido down to normal levels. Miles&#39;s libido was as high as ever.<br />
<br />
Jemima tossed a 1. She moved to the &#39;Wish&#39; square. She had sensed that Dad was a bit hostile towards Miles. She silently wished that her parents would like him, no make that love him, as if he was there own son.  Mum said &quot;Make a wish&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I already have&quot; Jemima replied<br />
<br />
Sara&#39;s turn was next. She needed a 4 to win. She had enjoyed the game. She had found Jemima&#39;s boyfriend a lovely young man. She wished she had second child, a boy like Miles. She still had time. She was only 35 she could still have another baby. Pity there would be such an age difference from Jemima. She should of had a second baby 10 years ago.  4 years age difference would be nice better than 15 which is what the difference would be if she got pregnant tonight. She must be fertile. She was feeling very randy. <br />
<br />
Anyway time to toss. She concentrated on the number 4 then threw the dice. It rolled over and finished on a four. &quot;I win!&quot; she yelled. She moved her piece 4 places. &quot;Wishes granted. I hope you enjoyed the game. Do you wish to return to as you started?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara looked around the table. Jemima was a lovely daughter. The way she had changed in to a pretty dress earlier to grant her wish had made her feel warm inside. Miles her 10 year old son was just coming out of his shell. She loved him deeply. She thought he was perfect.<br />
She looked at her husband Rick. He was very handsome. Pity she hadn&#39;t got a chance to make him a few years younger but she loved him anyway. She asked the family &quot;Do any of you wish to revert?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jemima said &quot;I wish this silly game had given me a boyfriend like I asked it for&quot; <br />
<br />
Miles just shrugged his shoulders. He vaguely remembered that things had started out differently but he couldn&#39;t specifically remember any of the changes. He was more interested in his penis. It was sticking up and had gone hard. To him it was an unfamiliar feeling.<br />
<br />
Sara looked to Rick. He could remember that his dick had gained an extra 3 inches. Even though his extreme erection from earlier had subsided he was very keen the keep that change. The thought of screwing his beautiful young wife tonight was getting him hard again. He said to Sara &quot;I&#39;m happy to stay as we are&quot;.<br />
<br />
Much to Ricks relief Sara&#39;s next words were directed to the game board. &quot;We are happy to stay as we are. Thank-you game&quot; She packed the pieces up. &quot;Time for bed kids. School tomorrow&quot;<br />
<br />
Jemima and Miles cleaned their teeth and went to their respective bedrooms. Miles had trouble falling asleep. It felt cold being in bed alone. He just didn&#39;t feel right. He lay in bed in the dark for what seemed like hours unable to get to sleep. Eventually he got out of bed and tiptoed down the hallway to his parents room. He passed his sisters room. He could here her bed rocking. What could she be doing?<br />
<br />
He got to his parents door and was about to enter. He wanted to get into bed with them and have a cuddle. He could vaguely recall sleeping in here having cuddles. It must have been when he was little. He could hear Mum and Dad still awake. Their bed was rocking as well. Mum was moaning. Somewhere in the back of his mind Miles knew what was happening. He turned around and returned to his cold lonely bed.</p>
