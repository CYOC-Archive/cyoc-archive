<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">No, that was completely impossible. Joe was same old Joe when he came in and those pics must have been some sort of new FaceApp or something that Joe was playing around with.  Jake just couldn’t accept that those pics were of his very straight, very thin, lanky, college-age brother.<br />
<br />
Looking further through his brother’s things for some sort of an explanation, Jake found a bag full of candies. He picked them up, took one out and looked at it. It looked like a brown breath mint or something.  He sniffed the bag, and detected a darker, but pleasant smell of cinnamon, cloves, and something else he couldn’t quite place.<br />
<br />
He popped one in his mouth as he carefully replaced his brother’s things. It tasted great - earthiness of cinnamon, cloves, a hint of something tobacco-like. The aftertaste was a bit sweet like honey with a slight hint of saltiness. He thought it was pretty unique, but really good. <br />
<br />
Jake heard a thud come from the bathroom, and figured Joe was probably coming back. He picked the phone back up, one more time, glancing at the strangers, astonished his brother wouldn’t have deleted the pictures. Placing the phone back, he absentmindedly scratched his chest through his shirt and closed up his brother’s things.  <br />
<br />
As he made his way back to his room, he noticed his legs feeling weird, almost like he had a heightened awareness of his legs against his athletic shorts as he walked. He didn’t really think anything more of it, as he entered his room and sat down on his bed.  <br />
<br />
He heard his Joe heavily step through the hallway to his own room followed by a door closing.  Jake picked up his math book, and started looking at his weekend’s homework, but his mind kept drifting back to Joe’s phone, and the hairy muscle men in the pictures.  His dick twitched at the thought. That took him by surprise.  He adjusted himself, and went back to his homework.<br />
<br />
He guessed those guys were ok. The more he thought about it, it would be kinda cool to have a big beard like that one day. Maybe big muscles. Not that big. Maybe that big. His dick twitched again, and started to chub up.  That was really strange.  He wasn’t gay, but he’d get hard at anything lately. He adjusted himself and put a hand up to his face, where he was greeted with a sandpaper like layer of scruff?<br />
<br />
“What the hell!?”, Jake jumped off his bed and ran over to his mirror.  The face looking back, was his, albeit covered in a massively thick and dark 5 o’clock shadow that rose high up on his cheekbones.<br />
<br />
He touched the foreign hair, and noticed his forearms were covered in equally dark, equally thick hair. And they appeared thicker? Like someone who lifted weights thicker. Like those hairy bodybuilders in Joe’s photos thicker. His dick perked up a bit more as the thought of looking like them passed through Jake’s mind. Scared at the weird, uncontrolled thoughts coming out of his own brain, Jake stepped back, and got the first good look at his morphing body.<br />
<br />
He filled out his shirt, almost to bursting.  Arms filled the sleeves, as he saw two massive pecs pressing against the Nike logo on the front, the shirt pulled so tight he could make out hair actually growing through the stretched fabric as he watched.  His chest hung so heavy, the bottom part of the swoop was lost to the overhang of his new muscle tits. His jaw (was this really _his_?), now more square and masculine under the developing beard, dropped as he noticed long dark hairs creeping over the collar of his increasingly comically small shirt.  He felt the tension of the fabric on his growing delts and lats as the sleeves started cutting into his massive arms.<br />
<br />
Panicking, Jake pulled at the waist of the shirt, in a futile effort to pull it off his widening torso, as he raised the hem, he saw a furry six-pack pushing out of his formerly thin teen stomach.  It looked like one of those bodybuilders he’d seen in magazines, except where their abs were smooth, the crevasses between the bricks of his core were accentuated by thick, soft hair. The shirt caught and stuck on his widening lats, and he could hear the seams under his arms ripping. In a last ditch effort, he used his newfound strength to rip the shirt off, his fur-covered, massive muscles erupting through the tattered fabric.   <br />
<br />
Jake heaved a breath, feeling his racing heart through his thick chest. Looking back in the mirror, he could finally take stock of what he was transforming into. He couldn’t believe what was happening to him. He was looking less like a guy almost 20 and more like “A totally fuckin’ hot muscle bear ready to rut!” the fleeting thought invaded his consciousness as he internally screamed his heterosexuality.  A wave of helplessness fell over him as he realized the truth in the description, though.  His pecs were already juicy with thick muscle. His pelt had spread, covering both massive pecs to his growing and widening shoulders.  As a meaty paw stroked the hair-covered bowling balls of shoulders, down to ham-sized, equally furry arms, Jake was completely paralyzed with fear. “Fuckin’ sexy,” the foreign thought raced through his fuzzy, thickening mind, reflecting his fuzzy, thickening body, and as his gaze and attention were refocused, he noticed an equally fuzzy, thickening cock, free from its fabric cage, engorging itself as he took in his changes. <br />
<br />
“What’s happenin’ to me!?,” the concerned young adult voice cried out, now tinged with a slowness and a hint of deepness that only comes through an excessive production of testosterone. <br />
<br />
Jake looked down, his bushing beard bristling against the plentiful forest of his darkening, ballooning pecs. He cupped his left pec with his right hand and was surprised to feel his bicep crammed against his right pec. He could feel the thick hair brush against the corded muscle of his developing arm as the follicles on chest continued to lengthen, a certain part of his mind equally tickled and excited about the metamorphosis. He moved his hand through the fur on his growing left pec over to his right as a pelt instantly spread down his torso straight to his cock, leaving his furred six pack-turned-slight muscle gut under two thick, heavy, pillows of a hairy, muscled chest in its wake. <br />
<br />
The last thing Jake, the former gangly, slightly nerdy student processed through his thickening brain was that his lower body had been equally furred and muscled, shredding his athletic shorts and boxers, exposing a now uncut 11 inch monster that the brute known as Jake looked quizzically at before it erupted in a massive stream of cum, knocking the muscle bear unconscious on his bed.</p>
