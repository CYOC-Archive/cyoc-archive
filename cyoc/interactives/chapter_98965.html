<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff met Elizabeth at the top of the stairs.  She looked at him expectantly, and he realized that she did not know where her room was supposed to be.  He looked down the hallway, and saw a door that he had never seen before at the end of the hallway, far from his room and the stairs. He pointed to the door, and Elizabeth nodded, and they both silently walked into the room.  The room was a deep red color, like the color of Elizabeth&#39;s fur.  The walls were almost completely covered in large pictures and posters of horses.  The horses were different breeds performing a variety of activities, like running or drinking from a stream.  He saw with some amusement that all of the horses were male.  It reminded Jeff of the boy-band pictures his sister Suzy had kept on her wall - before she became an anthromorphic horse-girl, that is.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth immediately went to the closet, and began to look through the clothes excitedly.  Jeff looked at a picture of their family, in small frame on her nightstand.  Elizabeth was now included in the picture, as part of the family, and he saw that his Dad&#39;s breed had changed to Shire, just liked Elizabeth.  <br />
<br />
So that&#39;s why Suzy looks bigger, thought Jeff.  The easiest way for reality to change was to make Elizabeth part of the family.  And if she is a Shire, then we all must be, too. He felt some compassion for his Mom.  How in the world did she have sex with a creature as large as his Dad, much less give birth to two of them.  He shuddered at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is so great.  I was a little worried about how my family was going to afford to pay for my clothes, but because of your gift, your family is rich.  I guess I mean, my family is rich, &quot; said Elizabeth with a giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about - clothes?  Aren&#39;t you going to miss your old parents? &quot; asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth sighed.  &quot;Yeah, I know I will.  I&#39;m also going to miss my horses.  They were practically part of my family. But I also know that my family would be eager to have another hand around the farm to help out, especially one who will work for free and has a nice strong body like mine, &quot; she said, flexing her large biceps.  &quot;I am going to miss my shoes, thought.  I can&#39;t find any in this closet.  It looks like I&#39;m going to be walking around barefoot - or &#39;barehoof &#39;, I should say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it?  That&#39;s the only thing that is bothering you about this?  The only thing you&#39;ll miss?&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, &quot; she said, smiling as she turned to look at Jeff, &quot;I am going to miss that nice cock of yours.  Now that we&#39;re brother and sister, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to have any more fun like we did before.  But there are lots of horse farms around here.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked away in disgust.  Elizabeth walked up to him, and began to push him out of the room.  &quot;Okay, little brother, time for you to go.  Give a girl some privacy, so she can pick out some clothes and get dressed. I&#39;ll meet you downstairs in a few minutes. &quot; Jeff walked down the hallway towards the stairs; he paused briefly by his door, contemplating entering his room and trying to work on the program.<br />
<br />
The door to Elizabeth&#39;s room popped open, and she stuck out her head.  &quot;And don&#39;t even think of messing with that machine.  It won&#39;t work anyway, not without this, &quot; she said holding the detached power cord in her hand.  Jeff glumly walked down the stairs, defeated.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jeff sat at the dinner table with his mother and his sister, Suzy.  He wasn&#39;t hungry, and just picked at his food. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter, dear?  Not feeling well, &quot; asked his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m fine.  Just not hungry, I guess, &quot; said Jeff.  His sister smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he&#39;s in love, &quot; said Suzy with a giggle. Jeff blushed, and his Mom shushed Suzy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is that it, Jeff?  Has some nice young girl at school caught your eye?  Or maybe a nice filly on one of the farms? &quot; said his Mom. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt sick. &quot;No, Mom, I&#39;m just not hungry.  Leave me alone, &quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you need to eat.  You&#39;ll need your energy tomorrow.  It&#39;s a school day.  And you have a lot of work to do after school, a lot of eager customers, &quot;  said his Mom.  His stomach lurched at the thought of another milking, and he lost what little remained of his appetite.  He was about to ask to be excused, when Elizabeth walked down the stairs and joined them. She wore a nice long sleeveless black dress, that stretched to her knees.  The neckline was low, and accentuated her ample breasts.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s about time you joined us, young lady.  What took you so long? Well, I guess it was worth the wait.  You look much better now, much more like the nice young lady  I know you are, &quot; said her new Mom.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth blushed, and did a small curtsey.  &quot;Thank you, mother, &quot; she said gratefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, young lady.  My, what manners!  That&#39;s more like it.  A little fancy for a family dinner, but then again, it is fun for us girls to get dressed up every now and then.&quot;  said her new mother, and Suzy giggled.  The three women began their girl talk, discussing clothes, gossip and boys, and Jeff felt left out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;May I be excused?&quot; he asked sullenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you may, &quot; said his mother.  &quot;But I expect you to eat a big breakfast tomorrow.  No excuses. We need you to be healthy.  Your whole family is counting on you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and started walking up the stairs.  &quot;Oh, Jeff, &quot; said Elizabeth, as he walked away.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t use that computer if I were you.  I made some change when I was trying to fix it, and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s ready for you to use yet.  Better wait till tomorrow, when I can help you with it and we can work on it together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff scowled.  &quot;What the hell did you do?  What did you do to my computer? &quot; yelled Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffrey, language! &quot; said his Mom.  &quot;Your sister is trying to fix your computer, and offering her time to help you, and this is how you show how grateful you are.  You should thank her right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for helping me with my computer, &quot; said Jeff through gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, little brother.  Always happy to help, &quot; she said with a smile, then resumed her girl talk with the other women.<br />
<br />
Jeff hurried up to his room to assess the damage Elizabeth had done to the machine, and hoped he could fix it before it was too late.</p>
