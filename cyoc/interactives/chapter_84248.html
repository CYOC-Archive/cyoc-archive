<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In almost no time at all, Dave had made up his mind.  But before he was ready to head outside, Dave wrote down:  <br />
<br />
‘I will have a large black thick overcoat that fits me well hanging off the hanger in this office.’  Looking up, Dave now saw exactly what he wanted to see.  Now he’d have some protection against the weather.  <br />
<br />
Slipping his notes into a locked drawer, he then placed the pen and a small notebook inside his leg-pouch, along with his cigarettes and lighter, and his access card as well.  Now he put on his coat, but left it open at the front for the time being, before leaving to head outside.  <br />
<br />
As he walked through the offices, he noticed Cassie already back at work, typing away something.  Well, at least her old work ethic was a thing of the past to him now.  <br />
<br />
Down the stairs one flight, and he slipped outside to a gust of wind that brought a chill to him.  <br />
<br />
“Damn.  Forgot about that.”  He grunted to himself as he pulled out the cigs and lighter, slipping them into one of his coat pockets before he buttoned it closed.  <br />
<br />
That was better, now that the chilling wind was sorted, he walked swiftly over to the shelter which was the only place in the Office Grounds where they were allowed to smoke.  He did noticed that his legs movements were a little restricted, but he supposed that with his leg-pouch still on, it was to be expected.  <br />
<br />
While he was enjoying his Malboro however, the pressure in his bladder returned, a bit stronger than before, and Dave knew he’d need to go soon.  That’s why once he was done with his cig and put it out, he immediately made to go back inside, and then straight to the nearest men’s room.  <br />
<br />
It didn’t look too different from before, other than having a bit more space between the urinals and larger cubicles, which Dave put to accommodating larger people now, like Joe and Richard.  In any case, once he was done and with his hands clean again, he returned his cigarettes and lighter to his pouch and left, deciding to leave his coat on and open for the time being.  <br />
<br />
On his way back though, he was stopped by Janet.  <br />
<br />
“Dave, a moment of your time please.”  She pointed to an empty meeting room with her free hand, the other one holding a folder.  <br />
<br />
Dave complied and once they were inside and certain of peace, she spoke.  <br />
<br />
“Now I know you’ve just been promoted, but this came through literally just a few minutes back, and needs to be dealt with before Monday.”  She handed him the heavy folder, which when Dave checked, contained a large number of financial records from their various offices and workplaces.  “So tell me now.  Can you do it?”  She asked him, with her arms folded beneath her bare boobs.  <br />
<br />
“I can.  It’ll mean taking the extra hour, and coming in on Sunday, but yes, I can do it.”  Dave replied, certain of the fact.  <br />
<br />
“And why not tomorrow?”  <br />
<br />
“I already have that day taken up, taking my girlfriend out.  But Sunday is free.”  he supplied the reason.  <br />
<br />
“Alright then, but make sure it’s done in time.  Once it’s finished, leave it in my office and I’ll deal with it on Monday.”  Janet agreed to it.  “I’ll have the rest of your schedule either cleared or transferred to make room for this.”  With that said, she turned to leave, her boobs swaying from the motion.  <br />
<br />
Once Dave was back in his own office, the time said 14:00, so the lunch hour had just ended.  Putting his coat up and out of the way, he sat down by his desk and looked over the work he’d just been handed.  There was a LOT of work to be done, and he supposed he’d better get right to it, starting with the main labs that were actually not too far away.  <br />
<br />
About two hours later, and Dave had worked through about a third of the reports, by his math, he worked out that if he did take the extra hour, he could end up only needing about half of Sunday to have these reports completed.  That certainly helped to bring a smile to his scaly face, though he’d still need to go to Ross to clear the paperwork needed to get himself in on the Sunday, and to get the keys needed for that.  <br />
<br />
Having been sitting for two hours straight, he needed to get up again, and stretch his limbs, his long forked tongue sliding out of his mouth as he sighed in relief as the stiffness was stretched away.  <br />
<br />
Taking the time to look outside his office, he looked at the ones he transformed with the pen’s power.  Amanda, Mikki, Nicole, Cassie, Joe, Jenny and Jodie, all working away quite happily, and everyone paying no notice to their lack of clothing or their anthropomorphic appearance.  <br />
<br />
He still had his reports to finish though, and the more he got done now, the less he’d have to do later.  But first, he left his office to speak with Jodie, who was busy working at her own workstation, her forked tongue flicking in and out periodically.  <br />
<br />
“Jodie?”  He asked once he was in front of her.  <br />
<br />
“Yes Dave?”  She looked up from her screen to face him.  <br />
<br />
“I will be working late today, but I can handle the task so you’re free to leave soon.”  <br />
<br />
“Okay then.  Thanks.”  She returned to her own work as Dave went back to his office, mentally preparing himself for the work he needed to do.  As he made his way further though it, his thoughts drifted to the Pen.  True, he could use it to make the work finished now, but having already said he’d be in on Sunday, that would’ve left him dealing with a potentially empty office with nothing to do.  No, it would be better to have some work to escape total boredom.  But he could do something with it right now to make a proper break from the work.  It was just a matter of what, exactly, he wanted to do.</p>
