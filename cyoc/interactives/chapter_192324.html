<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she finished her meal, the real Kate, now in Kerry&#39;s form, watched Lily and the older man dance. She guessed he must be her husband. She had not met him before but had heard a rumour that he was a tycoon of some kind. He was certainly wearing an expensive suit and Lily was adorned with jewels. Surely they couldn&#39;t all be diamonds?<br />
<br />
A new song started, a &#39;Swing style&#39; and Lily moved across and spoke in Kerry&#39;s ear. Next thing Kate saw was Tom stand up and help Kerry from her chair and the two of them followed Lily back to the dance floor. Kerry and Tom began to dance. Kate found it fascinating to watch her own body dance. Kerry was very graceful. Did Kate herself dance so elegantly? Or was it Kerry&#39;s natural grace showing through? Kerry and Michael had done dance classes that was probably why she was so good. In comparison Tom looked rather clutzy. <br />
<br />
Kate watched as Kerry whispered in Tom&#39;s ear. He stopped and Kerry positioned Tom&#39;s right hand below her shoulder and their left hands clasped. She then demonstrated some basic steps to him. Soon he grasped what she was demonstrating and the two began to sway and swing in unison. Kate was impressed. All of a sudden Tom didn&#39;t seem so clumsy.<br />
<br />
Kate felt like a voyeur watching the couple. She should not be jealous of Kerry dancing with Tom. Kerry was only doing what Kate had asked - pretend to be her. She just wished Kerry did not look so happy about it. The blonde woman was smiling and really seemed to be enjoying herself. Even Tom now had a big grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Kate&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by Michael &quot;Would you like to dance?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kate did want to dance but feared Michael would find her a let down as a partner. She declined and said &quot;I don&#39;t know how. I&#39;d embarrass you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense. Just follow my lead&quot; Michael clasped her hand and gently pulled her from her seat. Kate didn&#39;t object too hard. She did want to dance. The music was intoxicating and she had been tapping her feet. Besides Michael had also had dance lessons. He would perhaps cover her flaws. They moved to the dance floor. <br />
<br />
Michael positioned her left hand on his shoulder and she felt his hand on her back just below her shoulder blade. He clasped her right hand with his left and Kate realised they had adopted the same pose as Kerry and Tom. She also observed that many of the other dancers on the floor including Lily and her partner were also in the same pose.Kate stepped randomly to the music and swung her bum. <br />
<br />
Clearly Michael did not approve. He leaned in and said &quot;Watch my feet&quot; He demonstrated &quot;One step back, forward again then three steps to the side and back again. Try it. It&#39;s really simple&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate tried to emulate Michael. One step backwards then forward again to where she had started. She then shuffled her feet three steps to the right then three steps to the left. Michael smiled at her &quot;Yes! That&#39;s it! Now do it with me&quot; He re-took her into the pose and she tried to time her steps with his. It took a short while but soon she was stepping with him in time with the tempo of the music. His smile of delight gave Kate confidence.<br />
<br />
A new song started but Kate just kept doing the same basic steps. She watched Michael, like Kerry he seemed so elegant and she had to admit she found his movements very sexy. Somehow he manoeuvred her around the floor and she found herself dancing next to Tom and Kerry. Tom saw her and gave her a smile. Next thing she knew she was beside Lily, who was doing a more complex dance involving hand releases and lots of twirling. She was very good. Kate just stuck to the basic steps Michael had shown her.<br />
<br />
Before she knew it the band leader announced a 15 minute break. Kate realised she was exhausted but she couldn&#39;t help smiling. She had really enjoyed herself. Michael led her back to their table.<br />
<br />
Lily and her partner stopped Kerry and Tom on the dance floor. Kate saw Tom shaking the man&#39;s hand. She then saw Lily beckon to the other couple who had been sharing Lily&#39;s table. They came across and were introduced to Kerry and Tom as well. Michael had somehow purchased another drink for Kate. She accepted it. <br />
<br />
Kerry bought the other two couples back to the table and introduced Margie and Bill as well as Lily&#39;s husband, Evan to Kate and Michael. Of course she introduced Kate as &#39;Kerry&#39; as the ruse had to continue. The men got talking and Kate found herself chatting with Lily and Margie. Evidently Bill was Evan&#39;s business partner. Margie asked whether Kate worked and Kate had to reply that she was a receptionist (Kerry&#39;s job). Margie a tall blonde, who like Lily appeared to be in her late thirties told Kate she was a &#39;trophy wife&#39;. Evidently she was a retired model.<br />
<br />
Soon the band started up again and this time Kate was not reluctant at all when Michael took her hand and led her back to the dance floor.</p>
