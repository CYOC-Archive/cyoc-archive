<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey!  What the hell are you doing, Rudy?&quot; snapped Tony as he quickly shut the door behind him so that no one saw naked model body Rudy.<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, man&quot; said Rudy turning so that his might cock swung into Tony's view.  &quot;My-my Prada's just too tight.  I bent over to pick something up and burst my pants and shirt&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what you get for wearing that PeeWee Herman suit crap&quot; laughed Tony.  &quot;What are you doing wearing it anyway with that giant johnson?  Everybody knows only guys with tiny dicks wear Prada&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; said Rudy pulling on a shirt and pair of pants of Tony's &quot;I just thought maybe it'd be okay anyway&quot;  He gave Tony a pat on the ass.  &quot;I'll just shift the extra from the seat of your pants to the front&quot;  Tony smiled.<br />
<br />
Rudy eyed him very closely.  He wanted to kiss him right then, to press his new full model's lips to Tony's but he wasn't sure where he stood.  Tony had been made into a friend with the posthypnotic suggestion from his time as an ape but there were no guarantees of anything more.  But Rudy had thrown caution to the wind in getting Mark, Claire, Jack and Eric out of the way.  What the hell.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a belt loop and pulled Tony closer.<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Tony protested as Rudy pressed forward and parted his lips.  &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot;<br />
Rudy forced a laugh.  &quot;I'm kissing you, silly&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can tell&quot; said Tony pushing Rudy back with one hand.  &quot;What gives?&quot;<br />
&quot;What gives?!  You're a beautiful guy.  So am I.  Who else should we be with?&quot; Rudy chuckled and he rubbed his palm against the side of the fantastic arc of Tony's rear.  Tony shook his head and pushed back from Rudy and sat on his own bed.  His expression was befuddled.  <br />
&quot;I'm in . . love . . with Cl-cl . . &quot;<br />
Rudy smiled at his confusion although it surprised Rudy that Tony could remember anything of her.  The program was supposed to prevent that.  Rudy sat down next Tony, his side rubbing against Tony's.<br />
&quot;You're a beautiful guy, Tony.  Don't you think I'm handsome?&quot;<br />
Tony looked up from his confusion that looked away again in complete distraction.<br />
&quot;Sure, you're handsome, but I . . what the hell's the matter with me?&quot;  Tony pressed his hands to his head.<br />
&quot;Cl-cl-Claire!  Claire!  Her, her name is Claire!&quot; he said panting with the effort it had taken.  An undeterred Rudy pressed his lips to the velvety soft skin of Tony's neck.  Tony pushed him away.  &quot;Hey man!  I love Claire!  I-I don't want your affection.  I-&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony leaned back on his pillow.  &quot;What the hell's the matter with me?  I feel like my head's split in half.  There's Claire and-and there isn't.  There's there's Mark and there's . . Mary?  What the . . ?&quot;<br />
In his desperation, Tony swung his right arm out to one side and his hand came down on his small clock radio.  Music started playing and Tony snapped to attention, sitting upright.  His confusion was completely gone.<br />
&quot;Wait!  I love Claire.  Mark is my brother.  Jack is my friend and so is Eric.  Why the hell was I thinking that Claire and Jack and Eric don't exist and that Mark is a girl?&quot;<br />
A nervous Rudy tried to play along.  &quot;Who's Mark?  You don't have a brother Mark.  You have a sister Mary.  She's at the ballet right now&quot;<br />
&quot;No.  Mark is my brother.  This-this must be a chronivac thing.  Where is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Where's the chromo-vac?  The what?&quot;<br />
Tony jumped up from the bed to look under the desk.  Rudy panicked.  He thought of running from the room but froze by the door.  He inadvertantly rested one hand on the clock radio and turned off the music.  Tony, crouched on the floor, immediately looked perplexed again.  <br />
<br />
Rudy looked down at his hand on the clock radio.  Hmmm.  I told him to keep thinking of the hurdy gurdy music.  So . . when other music is playing he doesn't still hear the music that keeps him under my control.  Tony got up from the floor.  <br />
&quot;I-I've got to leave to pick Mary up at the ballet school in an hour or so but you can hang around till then&quot; he offered uncertainly.<br />
&quot;Sure&quot; said Rudy.  He didn't try to kiss Tony again.  He just silently ogled Tony from across the room while Tony read and ogled his gorgeous new blond self in the mirror.  When Tony went off to pick up 'Mary', Rudy left with the chronivac to deal with one of the soccer team/drama club bi guys.  Trevor, a chestnut brown long haired boy who spent most of the day conspicuously setting his lustrous locks behind one or the other ear over and over had been Rudy's biggest enemy in the group.  Rudy's best friend Billy had set up a three way call with Trevor in which Trevor had giggled about a whisper campaign of nasty remarks about Rudy that he'd been conducting.  <br />
<br />
Rudy knew how proud Trevor was of his hair and his slender figure.  He stopped outside his house and scanned.  The chronivac found Trevor in the upstairs bedroom, not surprisingly on the phone.  Rudy went to the extended option menus to get things exactly as he wanted then hit enter.  Splayed out on his belly on his platform bed, Trevor felt an odd sensation at his sides and rear.  He patted himself as he continued to listen on the phone.  He abruptly hung up after a few brusque words and rushed to the mirror.  He'd suddenly sprouted two doughy love handles and, patting his rear, a big fat caboose.  His Prada was uncomfortably tight.  But the shriek that Rudy heard from outside the house and caused him to walk away smiling was Trevor's reaction to seeing his pronounced widow's peak and deeply receding hairline.<br />
<br />
At the ballet school, Mark's emotions careened back and forth from shock to anger to humiliation.  &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; he wondered as he was lifted by his deliciously feminine hips and carried across the floor by first one boy then another, their hands disappearing in Mark's tutu.  &quot;I'm supposed to be the one carrying girls!  How can this be happening?&quot;  The only consolation to Mark was that the other three boys in the ballet class had no interest in him or any other girl.  They might have their hands at his female hips, but they only had interest in boys like Mark.  Mark knew the girls' parts well enough to dance passably as a ballerina and enough the toe shoe steps weren't that hard after getting used to it.  <br />
<br />
Mark was relieved to see Tony finally arrive to pick him up.  He looked for some kind of sign that Tony realized something was wrong.  But Tony just looked slightly off, slightly confused.  Mark's anger and shock was just too much to be subtle, though.  As they drove off, Mark turned to Tony.<br />
&quot;Does anything about me seem odd, Tony&quot; Mark asked in his female soprano.<br />
&quot;Um, I'm not sure&quot;<br />
&quot;Tony!  I'm not supposed to be a girl!  I'm a boy!  A boy trapped in a girl's body somehow!&quot;<br />
Tony just sputtered.  Mark felt like crying and couldn't bear the silence.  He turned on the radio.<br />
&quot;Oh my god.  You're right&quot; whispered Tony.</p>
