<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For once, your demon self felt true happiness.  You couldn&#39;t pinpoint why exactly before, but you felt somewhat empty inside since you were freed from your imprisonment.  Now, with Marino, you felt that emptiness fill in.  You had more of a meaning in life.  Speaking of Marino, he was laying on his bed, acquainting himself with his new life of luxury.  Meanwhile, you were watching the news in your living room, when you noticed something rather interesting.  &quot;In other news, a house in Pasadena was destroyed in a seemingly unprovoked explosion.  Earlier in the night, people around this neighborhood were complaining about screams and other loud noises.  Further investigation showed that the house belonged to ISIS sympathizer Ali Fuswani.  No bodies have been discovered in the wreckage.  It is speculated that the bodies were blown to bits by the violent explosion.  However, nothing can explain one eyewitness report.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Pierre.  Mrs. Agnes McClardy states that she saw an ominous figure in the house that night.  We have an interview with her right now.&quot;  The other anchor said.  The scene on the TV changed to show the neighborhood you got your breakfast in.  In the center of the screen was an older looking woman.  Somehow, you could see her soul through the TV.  It was pure white and good.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you were woken up by whatever was happening in that house, correct?&quot;  The interviewer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  This neighborhood has never had any situations like this.&quot;  Agnes started.  &quot;I&#39;ve always been curious about that house.  There always seemed to be people going there, but nobody around was ever invited.  This has always been a pretty friendly neighborhood.  Bust last night, it was weird.  I was woken up by a gunshot, and I was terrified.  I looked out the window to see what was going on, but I couldn&#39;t see anything on the street.  However, I saw something in the window across the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You lived across the street from Ali, right?&quot;  The interviewer clarified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  Through the window, I saw a bunch of people in the room looking scared.  Then, I saw what I could only describe in my nightmares.&quot;  She tried to continue, but became petrified with fear.  &quot;It was terrifying.  I can&#39;t even explain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, if it&#39;s not too much to ask, try.&quot;  The interviewer asked, trying to help the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  She said, trying to calm down.  &quot;I saw a large figure in the house.  It was in all black.  The only other things I could make out were glowing red eyes and black wings.  It looked demonic.  I thought I was still dreaming, but it was too real.  What I saw next was one of the men exploding, and that was it.  The window got covered, and I couldn&#39;t see anything.  I was praying to God for it not to come across the street.  I was so scared.  I looked out the window again, and I saw the house again.  It looked rather normal, until it exploded.  This was not a normal explosion that you see in movies though.  There was a brief flash of red, and then the whole house blew up in a red explosion.  It didn&#39;t look fiery either.  It looked as though it exploded from pure energy.  At this point, I was cowering on my floor, asking God why something like this would be happening here, and praying that it won&#39;t happen to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Agnes.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine.  Back to you Pierre and Audrey.&quot;  The interviewer said, finishing the interview.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, judging by Agnes&#39;s account, there must have been something at the house punishing the terrorist.&quot;  Pierre started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully she was just hallucinating, because that interview gave me goosebumps.&quot;  Audrey laughed nervously.  You immediately turned off the TV and started thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, guess I have to be a bit more careful now.&quot;  You thought.  &quot;I just people will forget about this for a while.&quot;  To take your mind off almost getting caught, you went to your kitchen to make some food.  You were feeling food hungry.  As opposed to soul hungry.  You decided to make yourself a sandwich.  You put your slices of bread into the toaster, and telekinetically opened the fridge to get the deli meats out.  The turkey, cheese, salami and mayo all floated out of the fridge and moved next to you.  You smiled, remembering how much you loved having powers like these.  Once the bread finished toasting, you prepared your sandwich and ate it.  It didn&#39;t taste nearly as good as a fresh soul, but it still satisfied your appetite and desires.<br />
<br />
You sat back down on the couch and grabbed one of your demonic books, disguised as The Catcher In The Rye.  As soon as you opened the book, you sensed a soul approaching.  It was just Marino.  No cause for alarm.  &quot;Hey Marino.  How do you like the house?&quot;  You asked with a big smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it Dad.  This is everything I&#39;ve always wanted and more!&quot;  He replied happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I have a bit of a plan today.&quot;  You started.  &quot;So, as you might know, I used to be Ruler of Hell and overseer of all of the damned souls there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and you were good friends with King Tharin.  You told me this earlier.&quot;  He interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was planning to visit my good friend today and show him my son.&quot;  You explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.  You want me to meet King Tharin?&quot;  Marino said, dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  If it&#39;s going to be a legal adoption rather than a kidnapping, I&#39;m going to need some legal backing.  Right?&quot;  You laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not even sure the last time I was in Falrenkar.&quot;  Marino wondered aloud.  &quot;I&#39;ve never been able to go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what you have me for!&quot;  You laughed as your right hand started to glow black.  You reached it into the air and waved it counterclockwise, making a black arch in mid air.  As soon as you were finished, the arch rained black energy downward, creating a black door with a brass knob.  &quot;After you son.&quot;  Marino opened the door, and was greeted to a forest.  you immediately followed and walked into the same forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we?&quot;  Marino asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tharin&#39;s island.  Just outside the gate in.&quot;  You explained.  &quot;Follow me.&quot;  You flew up and to the gate.  Two different demons were standing guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halt, who goes there?&quot;  One guard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lord Ral Gadnar, and guest.&quot;  You said.  &quot;Just open the gates already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes My Lord!&quot;  The demons opened the gates quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because I don&#39;t rule anything anymore doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have my Lord status.&quot;  You smiled to Marino.  &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;  The two of you walked into the castle, down the long corridor, and eventually into the throne room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ral!  Long time no see!&quot;  Tharin yelled, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been one day.&quot;  You laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;  Tharin laughed.  &quot;What brings you here today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well last night, I was out getting a soul when I ran in to this kid.&quot;  You started, motioning Marino to come closer.  &quot;At first, he was not happy that I got the soul he was trailing.  Within a couple of minutes, I unofficially adopted him as my son.  That&#39;s the long and short of it.  Considering our friendship, I thought it would make sense for him to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense to me.&quot;  Tharin responded.  &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marino Hadlet.  I&#39;m also a purger.&quot;  Marino answered nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marino, there&#39;s no reason to be nervous.&quot;  You assured him.  &quot;He&#39;s a close friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Dad.  I get nervous around people of authority.&quot;  Marino said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense!&quot;  Tharin boomed.  &quot;Don&#39;t think of me as King Tharin, considering who you&#39;re calling Dad.  Think of me more as Uncle Tharin.&quot;  Marino&#39;s demon heart fluttered with that realization.  &quot;Also, considering circumstances, I think you might be in for a name change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Marino asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re the son of Lord Ral Gadnar.  Wouldn&#39;t you want your name to reflect that distinction?&quot;  Tharin suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot;  Marino paused, shocked.  &quot;I-I-If Dad is okay with it.&quot;  He finished with a stutter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m more than okay with it.&quot;  You smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;From this moment onward, Marino Hadlet will be known to all as Lord Marino Gadnar.&quot;  Tharin said officially.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s official.  I&#39;m your son!&quot;  Marino smiled happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here!&quot;  You yelled.  Marino ran to you and gave you a huge hug.  Tharin joined in.  &quot;Tharin, I think you just made this little demon very happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not little!&quot;  Marino yelled, laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are compared to me!&quot;  You laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just really tall!&quot;  Marino continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Already bickering like a family.  That didn&#39;t take long.&quot;  Tharin laughed.  At this point, everyone was laughing, having a gay old time.  At one point, Marino started crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you crying Marino?&quot;  You asked, genuinely concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today has just been wild.  24 hours ago, I was a nobody demon struggling to find souls to eat.  Now, I&#39;m the son of the most powerful demon ever, I&#39;m a Lord, and the King of Demons told me to refer to him as my uncle.  It&#39;s just been a lot.&quot;  Marino explained.  &quot;That and I&#39;m hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So am I.  Let&#39;s find some souls.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;See ya Tharin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Ral.  Bye Marino.  See you soon!&quot;  Tharin yelled as you walked out of the castle.  Once you got outside of the gate, your right hand glowed black again.  You made a clockwise arch in the air, and a door appeared.  You went through, and ended up back in your house.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Son.  I&#39;ll give you 10 minutes to get ready.  Then, we&#39;re going soul hunting.&quot;  You told Marino.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it Dad.  I&#39;ll be down in 8.&quot;  Marino said excitedly.  &quot;I&#39;ll finally get to see you get a soul.&quot;  You watched as he hurried up to his room.  You just smiled as you picked up the book you were going to read before and started reading it.</p>
