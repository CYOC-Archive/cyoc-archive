<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun fell across his face, Jake slowly opened his eyes. Coming up foggily from his dreams, he shifted on his side. His fuckbuddy Marcus was still sleeping. He felt his monster cock engorged with blood and he leaned over and kissed Marcus on the mouth. Marcus opened his eyes and a kind of happiness stole over his face as he looked at Jake--a reaction Jake was well used to. After all, he was a seriously beautiful guy. If he was taller or in better shape he could easily model. Heck, if he bothered to try he could probably work in Hollywood. He had the sort of face that captivates people as they walk down the street. A smile from Jake opened almost any doors in his way. His smile charmed all the boys into his bed and then his huge cock did the rest.<br />
<br />
Marcus returned the kiss fervently and Jake ran his hands all over Marcus' body. Before long, Jake had turned Marcus over and was fucking him wildly, Marcus moaning in ecstasy as Jake pummelled in and out of him without mercy. They came together, both yelling.<br />
<br />
In the after glow, Marcus sighed. &quot;You are so beautiful, I could never get tired of waking up next to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake, on the other hand, was ready to start his day. Marcus was just a fuck buddy and nothing more although Jake was well aware that Marcus had a big crush on him. He didn't blame Marcus though, with a face like this who could resist? He made some excuses and pretty soon Marcus was gotten rid of, only satisfied after Jake promised to come out to the club later (actually he was always there Saturday nights--he had to see Trent).<br />
<br />
After admiring himself in the mirror for a while Jake went about his day. He didn't have much of an apartment since he didn't make a whole lot of money at the low level magazine job he had and he spent a lot of money on personal care products and clothes. He had to keep up with the trends. Truth be told, he was very vain and spent most of his time thinking about himself. At least the temp agency had gotten him a steady job at this stupid gay magazine place--although all the boys were so studious anyway.<br />
<br />
Jake made a point to be at the club every Saturday lately. He'd been making eye contact with that porn star, Trent Everett for weeks now. He had the biggest crush on him but he just hadn't built up the courage to talk to him yet. Trent was a bit taller than him and in way better shape and Jake was scared that Trent would reject him for his body, which he always masked with trendy clothes.<br />
<br />
At the club, after many, many drinks, Jake's friends (he was kind of the star of his group) finally goaded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight's the night man! You have to go dance with him, he's been looking at you all night!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, come on! Marcus isn't even around so he won't get jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus had gone to the bathroom so it was a good time to disappear. Bolstered by the drink in him, Jake took a deep breath and confidently walked towards Trent.<br />
<br />
Trent was dancing with the blonde boy who he always came to the club with--the blonde boy was really cute and all but he was no Trent. Jake decided to use the &quot;make him jealous&quot; strategy. He began dancing with the blonde boy who easily complied, obviously captivated by Jake's stunning good looks. On face alone Jake was even better looking than Trent, by a mile, and he knew it. The blonde boy was easy pickings but Jake's real goal was Trent. Sure enough, Trent moved in and began dancing with them. The three danced together for a while and finally Jake turned around and focused his attentions on Trent. The blonde boy, disappointed, drifted off to the side to watch. Jake could feel his huge cock stirring in his pants--god, he was always horny! Apparently Trent could feel it too because he began grinding in on Jake, encouraging him. The room got hotter and Trent pulled off his shirt revealing his glorious muscled hard body. After a few more minutes Trent turned around and whispered into Jake's ear, &quot;Take off your shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take off your shirt. Here.&quot; Trent grabbed Jake's shirt and Jake reluctantly let him pull it off. Jake noted the inevitable fall of Trent's face--this beautiful guy had a body like this? Trent danced with him a little longer but it was over as soon as the shirt came off. Eventually Trent danced off, leaving Jake alone. Jake felt a hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry man, he likes muscle. I thought he wouldn't go for you because you were kinda skinny and short but he liked your face. Too bad. You are really good looking though. I'm Paul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Paul, nice to meet you,&quot; Jake said distractedly. They made small talk for a little while longer but Paul quickly sensed that Jake had a one track mind and went to find Trent.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night was a drunken blur. Suddenly he found himself at home, on his couch, on the phone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back again, Mr. Brown? Still unsatisfied?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake moaned. &quot;Yes, yes! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still willing to pay the price?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything! Make me good enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then the deal is done!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the man hung up and Jake passed out.</p>
