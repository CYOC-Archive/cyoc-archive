<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ever since she became aware Lucy and her friends now had control of the Chronivac, and could do whatever they wanted, including potentially mucking with her profile, Jennifer had become stuck in a dilemma. On one hand, there was no problem with her seeing herself as who she was, Jennifer Grace, and knowing how with ease she was able to assume this was who she was. Yet, at the same time, who she used to be, Jeff, older brother of Lucy, made themselves known, and she could feel him, almost as if he was sitting just outside her vision, waiting to step forward.<br />
<br />
She knew this was who she&#39;d been, was, yet was confused on the whole matter, much in the same way she struggled to understand her connection to the Chronivac. Grasping it had something to do with Felicity and something the other girl had either wanted to do or suggested, Jennifer couldn&#39;t make sense of which, if either. Going along with everything around her, as being a girl who&#39;d moved recently to town and had made friend with another girl, then was introduced to the girl&#39;s other friends, made sense. And yet, a part of her was having seconds thoughts about the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Alone in the bathroom, having excused herself from the group as they watched a movie whilst waiting for the food ordered to be delivered, Jennifer stood with her skirt grasped in one hand and pulled up. Staring at the cotton shorts sewn under the skirt, knowing they were more like a pair of boxers or boy-shorts, though, she wasn&#39;t sure which, knowing she had no underwear on underneath, as the garment could be worn with or without panties, the gusset in the shorts proof, she looked at her flat front and thought about what the soft cotton was pressing into between her legs. Thinking about this, what she&#39;d said to Felicity some time ago, how she didn&#39;t want to be stuck as a girl, she ran her free hand over the front of the shorts, tugged briefly on the leg sections of the shorts, which rode high, then slipped her hand between her legs.<br />
<br />
Cotton fabric separating her hand from her girl parts, she pushed upward, even as a voice told her what she was doing wasn’t appropriate. Not caring at the moment about lessons she’d learned on how it was naughty for a girl to touch herself down there, unless she was bathing or using the toilet, Jennifer pressed her palm into her flat groin and after a bit of adjustment, two fingers into her vulva. Feeling the crotch portion of the short pressing harder, tighter, against her privates, confirming she was indeed a girl, she hoped this would be enough to banish again the part of her which was Jeff, and she could go back to the blissful ignorance of not being aware, except for a thin sliver in her mind, which was almost like a long-forgotten dream.<br />
<br />
This not working, she considered pulling one of the leg openings to the side and exposing fully her vulva. Huffing instead, “Dammit,” she instead took her hand off her crotch, let go of her skirt, grasp the hemline and pulled it forward.<br />
<br />
With a clear view down her front, she peered at the smooth, flat skin. The part of her still Jeff was upset there wasn&#39;t anything there, whilst the part of her who was Jennifer was glad she wasn&#39;t seeing any icky boy parts. Suddenly aware of how she&#39;d thought of the cock and balls she&#39;d had when she&#39;d still been Jeff, she pushed down on garment until it was lowered enough to display her to about the point her legs started, as well as show the faint hint of the cleft indicating where her genitals were, and stepping over to the toilet, she raised the lid, turned, pushed the garment the rest of the way down, sat down and released her bladder as her mind insisted she&#39;d done countless times since she&#39;d been potty trained. Finishing by wiping and patting herself dry, Jennifer didn&#39;t stand right away, and instead peered down at her crotch as the second thoughts she&#39;d been experiencing crept back into her mind.<br />
<br />
Not sure what she ought to do, wanting to talk to Felicity, but unsure how to go about doing so, and if the other girl would understand fully what she was feeling and talking about, Jennifer sighed. Standing, she was about to pulled her skirt shorts back up, but stopped when she saw the full-body mirror hung on the wall. Stepping in front of it, she studied her long hair, the top she had on, especially how short the sleeves were, which ended in a sort of lacy crimp, the almost lace-like heart shape cut in the top, up by the neckline, then dropped her eyes to her groin. Holding her legs firmly together, she stared at the pale, pinkish-white skin, lifted her shirt, peered at her unassuming body, took note on how her nipples were so small and pale they were almost invisible, then released her hold on her shirt and pulled up the bottom half of her outfit. Adjusting it so it was pressing against her privates in a comfortable way, she muttered, &quot;Do I want to stick it out until Sunday, like I think was planned? Or should I try and turn myself back now and leave Felicity, or whoever she was before, to remain so until Sunday?&quot;<br />
<br />
Having no answer, she stepped over the sink and proceeded to wash her hands. After she&#39;d done this, and as she dried her hand, she looked at her reflection, and the part of her which was Jennifer Grace took full control as she thought she was, as she&#39;d been told by her mommy, an aunt, and her grandmama, a pretty girl. Feeling conflicted about this, as a part of her which was Jeff insisted she wasn&#39;t supposed to be a pretty girl, she exited the bathroom. Standing in the hall, listening to the movie playing in the living room, still having second thoughts as the part of her which was Jeff insisted this was Felicity&#39;s plan and the other girl was welcome to, but she, Jennifer, ought to revert back to being who she actually was, she wondered what she should do. After a bit, she believed she had an answer on what to do.</p>
