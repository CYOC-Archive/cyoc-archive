<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I woke early the next morning. 1st order for the day was a visit to the bathroom. My period did not appear to have eased. After a shower and putting on some of Sarah&#39;s work clothes, in this case another black skirt and a mauve blouse with the dealerships logo on the pocket, I gave Rod a ring.<br />
I explained what had happened last night and he agreed that he did want Sarah to move in. He suggested I collect together all of Sarah&#39;s jewellery, anything else that looked valuable and then fill the car with clothes. I would have time to drop off a load on the way to work.<br />
I then went down to the kitchen where &#39;Mum&#39; and &#39;Dad&#39; were sipping coffee over the daily papers and explained my plans whilst I prepared breakfast. <br />
&#39;Dad&#39; got up &quot;I&#39;ll fetch you some bags and boxes&quot; and wandered out to his shed. <br />
By the time I had eaten he was back and together we went up to Sarah&#39;s room. Whilst I lay the boxes on the bed he examined to door. &quot;I&#39;ll  put a lock on here this morning. You gather what you want, I&#39;ll see if Jenna&#39;s awake&quot; then wandered off down to Jenna&#39;s room.<br />
I started with Sarah&#39;s jewellery carefully placing the items into a small solid looking box. Anything loose I put in a plastic bag first. Next I emptied out Sarah&#39;s underwear drawers. I must admit my hands lingered when emptying a second drawer filled with particularly silky and lacy items. The old Zach was still in there somewhere. As I took the first load out to the car I noticed &#39;Dad&#39; talking through a closed door to Jenna. <br />
Sarah&#39;s car wasn&#39;t big so I calculated I could fit only one more box and then some loose clothes on top. Anything else could wait for the weekend. I filled that box with shoes and necessities out of Sarah&#39;s section in bathroom. I filled the rest of the available car space with loose clothing from the wardrobe. I made sure to collect anything that looked expensive. My estimate was that I had removed 50% of what was there. The rest could be left to the real Sarah over the weekend.<br />
Satisfied with what I had achieved a I went into the kitchen to say farewell to &#39;Mum&#39; and &#39;Dad&#39;. On approach I could hear Jenna was with them. Voices were slightly raised. As I entered but before I could say anything Jenna saw me, glared daggers and screeched &quot;Dobbing bitch! I&#39;ll get you for this&quot; Luckily &#39;Dad&#39; was between us and was able to restrain her as she came at me.<br />
&quot;You should go&quot; he said <br />
&#39;Mum&#39; came and ushered me to the door &quot;She doesn&#39;t mean it, she will calm down. Best you go now. Give me a ring tonight&quot; She gave me a quick hug and closed the door behind me.<br />
<br />
...........<br />
It was 8am by the time I pulled into Rod&#39;s driveway. His car was still there. I needed to be at work by 8.30 so with Rod&#39;s help we quickly ferried the clothing and boxes into the spare bedroom. &quot;You can sort things out tonight&quot; <br />
Biddy was all excited to see me but was disappointed when I didn&#39;t stop to play. He had a sad look on his face when he got locked in the back yard &quot;I&#39;ll make it up to you with a walk tonight Biddy&quot; I said as I ruffled his head.<br />
<br />
...........<br />
It was a tick after 8.30 when I entered the dealership. Marlene gave her watch a glance as I entered, but gave me a smile and said &quot;It&#39;s just you and me this morning  Karen has been seconded to help set up our display at the motor show&quot;<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s around today&quot; <br />
&quot;Only Mitch, Daniel and the workshop boys. The boss is in this morning as well. Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll keep an eye on Mitch&quot; Daniel worked in the office and appeared to be some sort of accountant, I had met him yesterday, he had seemed very shy. The &quot;Boss&quot; I assumed was Mr Penberthy, after all the business was called &quot;Penberthy&#39;s Mazda&quot;  I had not met him.<br />
I was looking after the front desk this morning which mostly involved answering the phones and greeting costumers. It was very quiet, Marlene explained that if anyone was intent on looking at cars this week they would be more likely to visit the car show which opened on Friday and ran for the weekend. They could compare all the brands together at the one location.  <br />
There was one middle aged couple who came in at around 10am to take a Mazda 6 for a test drive. they were very friendly and chatty with me and asked how my parents were. I gathered they were family friends but I had no idea who they were. I tried to bluff my way through the conversation and was actually relieved when Mitch showed up and took them off my hands.<br />
Not long afterwards a smartly dressed young man came who looked about my age. He paused once in the door and was looking over the showroom.  I knew to let customers wander around before approaching them, so left him as he inspected the display cars. I gave him several minutes then approached and introduced myself as Sarah.<br />
&quot;Hello Sarah, I believe we have met before. I don&#39;t forget a pretty face&quot; he saw the engagement ring on my finger &quot;That&#39;s a pity&quot; he said gesturing towards the ring &quot;I see you are off the market&quot;<br />
&quot;May I help you Sir?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just looking. Are none of the salesman here?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mitch is out on a test drive&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I might have to help out until he returns&quot;<br />
I was puzzled not knowing what he meant &quot;Feel free to look around sir&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you Sarah&quot; <br />
I returned to the desk to answer a ringing phone.<br />
It was a customer enquiring about servicing their vehicle, while I was transferring the call to the workshop. I noticed the customer had opened the &quot;Staff only&quot; door and wandered through to the back offices. I finished the transfer and hurried after him.<br />
I was about to call out &quot;Sir&quot; as I opened to door but stopped as I saw the man shaking hands with Daniel and being approached by Marlene. Marlene greeted him with &quot;Good morning Alan. I hope you find things satisfactory&quot;<br />
It dawned on me that this was &#39;the Boss&#39;. I had almost made a fool of myself. I closed the door and returned to the desk. I tried to appear very diligent for the rest of the morning.<br />
At lunch time Alan left giving me a cheery goodbye. Daniel asked whether anyone needed anything from the takeaway store so I gave him cash to purchase me a salad roll. I ate my lunch with Daniel and Marlene in the staff lunchroom from where we had a view of the showroom, so I could still greet customers and answer the phone.<br />
Over lunch Marlene asked if I was doing anything on Friday evening<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so&quot; I replied, not knowing what the real Sarah might have arranged. <br />
&quot;Well if you do you will have to cancel. Alan would like you and myself to attend the Motor Show cocktails and dinner evening. I know you were disappointed that Karen got to go last year and you missed&quot; <br />
Ohh I thought. I&#39;ll be swapped back by then. And if Sarah had wanted to go last year &quot;Ok, sounds good&quot; I replied &quot;Can I bring Rod?&quot;<br />
&quot;You know it&#39;s staff only. Surely he will allow you off the leash for one night&quot;<br />
&quot;Uhh OK&quot; Sarah&#39;s problem not mine.<br />
At around 3pm Karen returned with Bill and Steven, two of the salesmen. They were happy with the way the stall at the show venue was progressing and would start moving cars into position tomorrow.<br />
When I mentioned the invitation to the cocktail evening, Karen was enthused &quot;Oh you will love it, everyone looks so fancy. You should wear that Silver dress we found at &#39;Shazzam&#39;s&quot; (A dress shop in town) <br />
&quot;The one with the sequins?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes that&#39;s the one, Have you worn it yet? Did you wear it at the engagement party?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ahh no. I wore the crimson dress I had worn to the Gala ball last month&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh you must wear the silver dress&quot; she turned to Marlene &quot;We bought it last Thursday night. Sarah looks sensational in it&quot;<br />
I didn&#39;t want to tell them that Jenna had worn the dress and that it was possibly ruined.<br />
&quot;Oh Sarah, before I forget, we are in need of a wing defence on the netball team tomorrow night. Do you think you could fill in again?&quot;<br />
Feeling trapped I could only say &quot;Sure&quot; after all I fancied myself as a good basketballer. Surely netball couldn&#39;t be too difficult.<br />
&quot;Good. 7.30 tomorrow night. I&#39;ll let the other girls know&quot;<br />
Shortly after it was 5 o&#39;clock and time to go</p>
