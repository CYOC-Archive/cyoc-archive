<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Later when you have arrived at the mansion you get back to your room only to find in the bathroom a decanter filled with a black oily liquid and a private note from Doctor Thule.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have felt after today that we have been spending too much of my precious time considering what do do with you. At present I have several fine offering which would be excellent long term placements. These being with major zoos about the country or possible private collections abroad. In either case it is time we begin your transfer of species. The decanter before you has in it a liquid which after it is drunk will cause your human skin to thicken. In a short span of time what you will have for skin will be animal hide, thicker, heavy with blood veins for better body warth during cold times. Later we shall change the coloring, be it black which is common or another color based on the final chosen form.&quot; he wrote and now its up to you.<br />
<br />
A glass sets nearby and popping off the cork in the decanter the room fills with a pungent odor simular to those you've smell about the different animal barns.<br />
<br />
One glass full you look at it for a moment and then down it in two big gulps. Instantly you note the oily film coating your mouth and throat. Although the taste in like a creme soda you know it has radical properties which will change you.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later the decanter sets by your bedside empty. You've downed it making the way for your first changes from human to an animal. As the call to come down for dinner is chimed your feelings are mixed about eating anything. <br />
<br />
The voices out in the hallway are of those six choosen people thinking their to become nudist satyrs and live free on some private island. As if you might tell them the truth told by Doc Thule, it might blurt out at dinner. You decide to remain in your room and lay there thinking about all you saw today.<br />
<br />
Its almost eleven when you get up still feeling uneasy about what you have started. The inner desire to be near somebody wanting your company sends you sneaking out the bedroom and into the night.<br />
<br />
Zig zagging the security men you make your way back to the cattle barn . Inside there is a dull light allowing you enough to see where your walking. Slowly you walk down the center isle till just outside Allen's corral. <br />
<br />
Allen, the big red Angus bull you saw earlier in the day stands watching you walk his way. You kneel just outside his corral fence and begin to talk to him wondering if he is as bright as what Justin was back in the zoo.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHO'S THERE?&quot; booms the voice of Allen's caretaker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I came back for a visit!&quot; you say aloud directing the man to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh its you, alright then but I need to warn you about something. As with all the cattle their body fluids have an ability to infect people, it makes them change into Red Angus cows. You saw me as I was infected and in time will be one of Allen's cow lovers. His urine, maunre, and saliva are lightly infectious, but the mucus coming out his nose can change you over night. So beware his snoty nose that it not touch your skin!&quot; warns the caretaker of Allen's special ability.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's so friendly!&quot; you remark as the big bull comes to be at your side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, he's friendly now, away from his cows. If you be near him when some cow be in heat his human and rational self is burried by feelings of instinct and procreation. Then he is total animal and nothing but animal!&quot; the caretaker tells you.<br />
<br />
He's so...compasionate like he wants my company and a friendship.&quot; you suggest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen Bing was his name when he came visiting one fine summer's day. A forgien exchange student was he at the Wild Rockies Field Institute. He interview with the Doc but showed up here about half way through the summer. Since then his taste in companionship has been mostly cows. I've watched him from the first as he cried himself to sleep many a night in that same corral. Yet by day his hormones needed to be satisfied and he was busy making the herd pregnant. Those accured instincts they do wear down one's intellect over time! Allen will have been here nineteen months now and I'd say his present mental powers are equal to a ten year old kid.&quot; explains the caretaker of Allen's history and plight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, a college educated student made into this and then degraded so to be little but s third grade level mentality!&quot; you mutter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh he knows you are human and who I am as well as the Doc. Now he hates the Doc and tries to hurt him whenever he comes near Allen's corral. So I know he remembers what he was and does know that he's a bull. I saw him that first day a well built guy weighing about 170 and not an once of fat on him. Then when he came here is body weight was close to 600 pounds. He has increased muscle and bone during the past year and now stands a mature Red Angus at 1100 pounds of pure beefy muscle.&quot; as the caretaker fills you in on Allen's history.<br />
<br />
Allen bellows out his hot breath you can feel from a few feet away. His head pokes through the steel fence and you begin to pet his locks up top.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he likes this!&quot; you state as Allen is breathing slow and making moaning sounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe but from where I'm at he's getting erect from your sensual touching.&quot; says the caretaker as you bend down to check Allen out.<br />
<br />
Just then two security men bust into the barn as Doctor Thule is close behind. You stand up as the caretaker steps away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was worried you'd try to escape!&quot; says the Doctor as his men come to stand either side of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a deal and I will in time accept what comes!&quot; you say to the Doctor.<br />
<br />
He eyes you for a moment and then looks down into Allen's corral. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thinking about Justin and Marge, if you feeling as Allen would make a good companion we might find use for another sound Red Angus bull.&quot; suggested the Doc.<br />
<br />
You look at Allen who by now has a ragging hard on the end jabbed into the dirt of his corral. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure yet even if he does look quite neat and nice. One has to get used to the idea of becoming a lower form of life before accepting what you offer.&quot; said you.<br />
<br />
An arm held by each security man your led out the barn and back to your room. Once there the doctor is about to bid you good night when you ask, &quot;Heard any word on what you have done with that volunteer I met on the plane coming here? Jefferys, his name was Louis J.Jefferys I believe.&quot; you ask wondering if the guy made it into his Rabbit hutch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its late, oh but why not humor me a little more, I'll tell you where he is now.&quot; says the Doc as he walks into your room a sits into one of the easy chairs.<br />
<br />
The two security men walk out the room but you know they are just outside the door. Doc Thule sighs and begins to tell of Louis J. Jeffery.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was brought here under the usual false pretense of becoming something of his own fantasy. If I want a rabbit one need only inject any bunny and they grow bigger almost overnight. The real trick to all this is that one can grow a person into an animal form that be larger than what that person was to begin with. Now like Allen Bing, he was grown from human to bovine and then made to mature as a complete Red Angus bull. The street whore grew into equine form and as a simple change we encoded her serums to make a sex change as well. Now florence is a special matter as for her and friends the actual body is increased for size but skull, legs, and arms must be downsized. We accomplish this by adding a virus which actually feeds on the person's bone and muscle tissue while the Reformation Process serums begin the real transition from human to animal. In short they become goats and as the skull shrinks down so also does the memory capacity. Inside six months of change and sexaul fondling there won't be a complete human thought left in their heads.&quot; explains Doctor as he smiles with telling of his venture.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust your getting a lot to restart that line of Austrailian Mountain Goats?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Doctor Thule smiles, &quot;One million each, and maybe more if someone wanders onto the island. I have serum canisters posted everywhere and they will find them being then infected a was Florence and friends. If luck be with me I might find such funding a regular in the future!&quot; says Doctor happily.<br />
<br />
He gets up and walks to the door, points at the security men and shakes his index finger as not to try and leave your room.</p>
