<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An all consuming darkness with no end.<br />
<br />
Kalil had been here many times before, for he was the only thing that often existed within the blackness. Wild messy blue hair which framed his face served to contrast the green garb he wore.<br />
<br />
There was no light to be found in this void. Neither ground nor sky existed, yet still the youth found himself fraught with intrigue at his surroundings--as he had each time this odd dream appeared to him. As with every time it began.<br />
<br />
But it would not last--the intrigue and tranquility crumbling away as a low monotonous rumbling of the darkened space around him took the place of its former silence--and his eyes rose upwards in awe as a towering shape formed from nothingness appeared before him.<br />
<br />
The silhouette was clear despite the greater expanse of blackness. Large and imposing, eyes blazing with forgotten power that made his skin--his very soul shiver as he stood in its shadow. Nothing more than an ant in its view, perhaps.<br />
<br />
A pair of large leathery wings fanned out from behind the beast, large talons digging into the nonexistent ground while its head lowered before him--maw parted in a bid to speak, only no sound came.<br />
<br />
No matter how hard he tried to strain, the youth could never make out the being&#39;s words. It had been the same as long as he could recall.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes, head lowering as he withheld a frustrated sigh. The creature&#39;s gaze remained fixed on him, but still--he could not hear it.<br />
<br />
Yet then… he heard something. A foreign sound. Something which pierced the soundless void and caused his eyes to snap open and widen upon observing the visage before him cloaked in flame, whilst more rose to surround him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awaken…&quot;<br />
<br />
A faint voice trickled from the burning beast&#39;s maw--body already reduced to nothing more than a pile of ash as the flames around them roared in unquenchable hunger.<br />
<br />
The blue-haired youth raised his hands as the flames billowed, yet still he could hear the distant voice. It carried with it a power greater than any he had known.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awaken… awaken… awaken…&quot;<br />
<br />
The eyes which glimmered with power flickered, and soon they were all that remained as the shadow of the beast was consumed by the flames--the single word repeated akin to a mantra, one which tainted his very being as he too, was swallowed by the flames…<br />
<br />
&quot;A...waken…&quot; <br />
<br />
The voice faded, and the roaring was all that remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awaken, child! If you do not, you will perish!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalil&#39;s eyes shot open, a gasp escaping him as he felt himself be shaken roughly--not even a second to gather his bearings as the face of an elderly woman came into view of his tired gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;G-Grandma?&quot; He asked, his voice groggy.<br />
<br />
He coughed, and a scent most unfit for a house wafted into his nostrils--and the uncharacteristic warmth which caused his skin to burn was made clear as a bright orange glow made itself known from all corners of his vision. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s... the house on fire?&quot; He wheezed, snapped free of his delay as the elderly woman practically pulled him from his bed and the scent of ash filled his lungs. &quot;W-What&#39;s... going on?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no time! We cannot stay here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait--what about Kayda...?&quot; He grunted as he followed his hurrying grandmother out of the burning ruins of his room--the warmth from the heat causing his hair and night clothes to stick to his skin. &quot;Where&#39;s my sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Helping the rest of the village!&quot; His grandmother shouted, undaunted by age as she beckoned him down the stairs of their home. &quot;Now hurry, into the sanctuary!  Our magic is warding the flames, so we&#39;ll be safe there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Go! We have to move fast--before the fire spreads!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalil nodded uncertainty, quickly trekking down the stairs as his grandmother followed behind him. Though he knew not to underestimate his sister&#39;s and the elder&#39;s magic, the dread in his chest kept rising with each step he descended. Only as he reached the final step and entered into the safety of the stone-walled sanctuary did he feel some semblance of relief--though the panic remained as he glimpsed nearly the whole of the village cramped inside--and from the still-open doors leading outside, the burning sky over his home.<br />
<br />
In a bid for answers, Kalil scanned the room before his eyes landed on an elderly, almost ancient man clad in a green robe decorated with silver markings--the leader of their forested home. Thankfully, it appeared the elder seemed to notice him as he immediately made his way towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elder what&#39;s happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A fire, as you can tell. We don&#39;t know what quite started it, but the forest isn&#39;t helping matters…&quot; The elder frowned, a grim look crossing his face. &quot;This was no accident…&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalil felt the pit in his stomach deepen, though before he could voice another question, he found his attention drawn to the sanctuary entrance as a young woman clad in verdant robes similar to the elder entered into view--long locks of blue hair framing her face, which bore an unreadable expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kayda!&quot; He shouted in joy, practically stumbling towards his older sibling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay, Kalil.&quot; She smiled as he neared, though she returned her focus to the greater crowd, and the weariness of her expression became evident. <br />
<br />
&quot;A-Are you okay?&quot; He asked hesitantly, noticing the air of unease his sister gave off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, don&#39;t worry about me.&quot; She whispered, not returning his gaze.<br />
<br />
Only then did Kalil realize the panicked chattering between the villagers had ceased, undoubtedly waiting for what his sister had to report, and so he hesitantly relented to join the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Demons are outside our village and its forest, arriving from the north. They caused this fire.&quot; Kayda announced after a period of silence, and her voice lowered. &quot;The outside of our village is completely surrounded. What they intend is clear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kayda&#39;s gaze drifted to Kalil, as if she were questioning whether or not to tell him. &quot;They intend to kill us all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The seal... has broken?&quot; The elder of their tribe gasped, and his face seemed to pale--causing the panicked murmurs to resurface with twice the intensity amongst the gathering of villagers.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Demon King has returned?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What can we do to fight them off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all doomed!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They fear us still, even with the knowledge our clan&#39;s power has waned?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should fight back then!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough, all of you!&quot; Kayda cried, bringing the sanctuary to silence; taking a deep breath before addressing the crowd once more. &quot;I know of the pride our clan holds--but such a reckless course of action will only guarantee your demise! If you all choose to fight, it will end in our complete annihilation.&quot; Her voice shook as she finished, and her eyes fixated on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you have us do then?!&quot; An elderly woman screeched, dissatisfied with her answer. &quot;Would you have us stand here to be consumed by the flames instead? Escape is our only course of action!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t listen to that hag!&quot; A young man piped up, stepping forth and halting before the clan&#39;s heiress with determination burning in his eyes; turning back to face the crowd as he pumped his fist. &quot;They want a fight, we&#39;ll give &#39;em one! Even if we lost that sacred power, we still have magic! They won&#39;t know what hit &#39;em!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalil found himself nodding at the man&#39;s words, and he glanced hopefully to his sister. Her face, however, showed no such keenness for battle.<br />
<br />
For her decision had already been made...</p>
