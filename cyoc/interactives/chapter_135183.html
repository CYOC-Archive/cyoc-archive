<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Chronology note: It is Tuesday evening, November 3, 2015 to everyone in our Andersons episode at the moment while the <i>Moon Lake Tad</i>episodes covering the debate are on Friday, November 6.—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, can you make it?&quot; Liz Brookshire asked.<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s for Peter, definitely,&quot; promised the werelioness she was talking to on the other end of her phone call. &quot;But how come I haven&#39;t heard a word about this before now?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Gloria,&quot; lied Liz. &quot;Stubborn male pride? Do you really think any male lion, let alone the werelion Prince of Moon Lake, would admit publicly that a normal human female has tricked him into proposing?&quot;<br />
&quot;But Peter Talbot and that blonde haired woman he&#39;s been seen with around campus look so happy together,&quot; Gloria said, referring to Peter&#39;s fiance Karen Yuletide and Moon Lake College.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s an act,&quot; protested Liz. &quot;Peter wouldn&#39;t tell me why he&#39;s marrying her, only that it would be a loveless marriage and that she doesn&#39;t know the first thing about being a werelioness, let alone a werelioness Princess and the future Queen of the Moon Lake lions.&quot;<br />
<i>But I do,</i> Liz thought to herself, as she looked at herself in the mirror of her bedroom at home, admiring the sleek curves and stripes of her fursona. <i>Peter should be marrying me, and I&#39;m going to make sure he realizes that one way or another.</i><br />
&quot;So Peter wants you to secretly gather up a bunch of us lionesses and set this woman straight on the facts of life concerning werelions?&quot; <br />
&quot;That&#39;s what he asked me to do during class today,&quot; Liz lied to Gloria. &quot;If you can join my little... intervention group, then we&#39;ll have 4, counting myself.&quot; <i>Although I don&#39;t dare show my face, let alone have Karen suspect I&#39;ve got anything to do with this.</i><br />
&quot;So, if I do this, what do we do?&quot; wondered Gloria.<br />
&quot;Nothing physical. We certainly don&#39;t want to harm the normal, let alone run the risk of accidentally turning her into a werelioness,&quot; said Liz, recalling Peter&#39;s warning that Karen Yuletide was not to be harmed, or else she&#39;d have to answer to his father Leon, the werelion King of Moon Lake. &quot;Just talk to her. Let this woman know what life as a werelioness would be like from first hand experience. You especially want to play up the negative aspects, like having to share your man with others. Stuff like that.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Liz. I happen to like sharing. Especially when there&#39;s more than just me and Kevin on the scene, if you know what I mean,&quot; said Gloria, thinking some very sexy thoughts.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; agreed Liz, with a smile on her face. &quot;But normal humans can be such prudes about the more enjoyable aspects of life. Besides, most of them freak out when they discover the one they&#39;re dating is cheating on them, let alone that their spouse has strayed during marriage. Can you imagine how it would be for Peter the first time he wants to be with someone else, let alone another lioness, other than her?&quot;<br />
Liz didn&#39;t know where Gloria was right now, only that she had to call her cellphone to reach the lady. There was silence on the other end of the call before Gloria finally said, &quot;Yeah. Okay. I&#39;m in. When and where?&quot;<br />
&quot;She usually has lunch by herself in the campus food court between 12:30 and 1 weekdays. I figured once she&#39;s gotten her meal and picked her spot, we&#39;d just sit down at her table and have a polite, but explicit conversation concerning the facts of werelioness life that will make her change her mind.&quot; <i>Then she&#39;ll dump Peter and he&#39;ll finally be all MINE!</i><br />
&quot;Okay. I have a class at 1 tomorrow that I shouldn&#39;t miss, but for Peter I&#39;m in,&quot; promised Gloria.<br />
&quot;Good. We&#39;ll meet at the north entrance of the food court at noon tomorrow to make final arrangements. See you then,&quot; said Liz, before hanging up.<br />
<i>Three should be enough. Don&#39;t want too large a group that would attract any unwanted attention. After all, I&#39;m running too much risk as it is if any of this gets back to Peter, let alone his father. But Peter Talbot is mine, and one thing Karen Yuletide is going to find out the hard way is that a werelioness protects what&#39;s HERS!</i><br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The object of Liz Brookshire&#39;s jealously and hatred was sitting in the empty dorm room she used to share with Jenny Harper, now the married Jenny Jenkins, doing her homework when there was a knock on the door.<br />
After rising from her desk and looking through the peephole, Karen Yuletide opened the door and smiled at her visitor.<br />
&quot;Hello Peter,&quot; she said happily, before giving him a quick kiss. &quot;Not that I ain&#39;t glad to see you, but why am I seeing you tonight?&quot;<br />
&quot;My 6 pm Civics class got cancelled. Something about the instructor not being able to make it,&quot; explained Peter, while lovingly wrapping his arms around his fiance. &quot;So I was just wondering if you&#39;d like to join me for a quick dinner and a movie at the Student Union.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need a specific reason to be with you,&quot; she said, snuggling up against him, &quot;but what&#39;s playing?&quot;<br />
&quot;A collection of Three Stooges shorts for a brief retrospective on their career. Depending upon how long we hang out together afterward, you should be back in plenty of time to finish your work,&quot; explained Peter, eyeing the texts on her desk. &quot;Can you join me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Soitenly!&quot; exclaimed Karen, trying to do her best attempt at a Curly Howard imitation. &quot;Just let me grab my purse and we&#39;ll get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Spencer Lawson began to moan.<br />
She felt something cold against her furry forehead. The fact that she was laying on the bed in her room wasn&#39;t lost on the hybrid werewolf-cat-panthress as she turned and saw her mother sitting next to her.<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;You fainted,&quot; explained Maggie Lawson. &quot;Here. It&#39;s just a couple of aspirin,&quot; she added, handing her daughter the medicine and a glass of water. &quot;Drink slowly.&quot;<br />
Spencer took the offering from her mom, then raised her head enough to comply.<br />
When finished, she handed the glass back to her mother and laid back down again.<br />
&quot;The last thing I recall was you saying I was in heat,&quot; said Spencer.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; began Maggie, sitting the glass down before turning to look at her daughter. &quot;You know the expression about having an itch that needs scratching?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
&quot;At times, guys get extremely randy and need to have sex. For female weres, depending upon the species, we go into heat and can&#39;t wait to be fucked,&quot; she said, putting it bluntly.<br />
&quot;That was what I was trying to do when you caught me playing with...&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll talk about you borrowing my things without permission later young lady,&quot; promised Maggie, thinking about the dildo Spencer was using that belonged to her. &quot;This is more important right now. Normally, all a female were has to do is find a willing partner and have fun.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve tried that already,&quot; answered Spencer, thinking about Eric Anderson. &quot;Not sure how it&#39;s going to turn out with him yet though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well good. Your father and I want you to make friends, let alone fully experience what it&#39;s like to be a were. We had to guard our secret so closely when he was active in the military and around the world with regular humans.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. Whether we&#39;re scarce or they intentionally stayed hidden, we didn&#39;t meet too many other weres during dad&#39;s career,&quot; recalled Spencer.<br />
&quot;Sad, but true,&quot; agreed her mom. &quot;I don&#39;t have the answer for that one. Most weres rejoice in finding others of our kind, but we don&#39;t go actively looking for them, let alone reveal ourselves to normal human beings.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. But what do I do about my... problem?&quot; asked her daughter. &quot;As pleasant as it was at first, I certainly wasn&#39;t getting any satisfaction, no matter how erotic my thoughts were.&quot;<br />
&quot;I bet. Unfortunately, that&#39;s your dad and my fault.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Spencer in disbelief.<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t intentional,&quot; quickly replied her mother. &quot;In a mixed species marriage like ours, any child usually favors the gender of whatever the corresponding parent is.&quot;<br />
&quot;A son would take after the father, the daughter the mother,&quot; realized Spencer. &quot;Okay. I get that. So...?&quot;<br />
&quot;In your case, you wound up with the best... and worst of both worlds. Your father&#39;s lupine werewolf heritage as well as my mixed werecat and werepanthress legacy.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think I turned out all right, so far.&quot;<br />
&quot;You have, and we love you very much,&quot; said Maggie Lawson, while hugging her daughter.<br />
Breaking the hug, she added, &quot;Unfortunately, we&#39;ve discovered the hard way that when you go into heat, you have the wolf, cat, and panthress all fighting for sexual satisfaction at the same time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Triple the need. Triple the longing and desire, which explains why I&#39;ve come on too strong to the boy I was interested in at times,&quot; realized Spencer. &quot;But hey, does this mean triple the sex too?&quot; she asked hopefully.<br />
&quot;Not quite young lady. Just that you need an actual partner and can&#39;t do it yourself, so to speak. Anyway, your dad&#39;s out looking for someone for you to spend the night with right now. No luck yet that I&#39;m aware of, but since part of your werecat nature is being bi, he does have more room to work with. But once you do scratch that itch, you&#39;re good till next month.&quot;<br />
&quot;So that does mean I do get to have sex tonight, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes young lady,&quot; said Maggie, running her fingers through Spencer&#39;s furry head. &quot;You just stay on your were birth control pills though. We certainly don&#39;t want any grand kids, kits, cubs, or whatever out of wedlock. You&#39;re too young to be a mother anyway. I didn&#39;t have you until I was almost 60,&quot; she added, since the average were&#39;s lifespan was roughly 400 years, barring unfortunate accidents or fatal disease.<br />
&quot;You know I&#39;m planning to graduate both high school and college before I even start thinking about having kids,&quot; Spencer reminded her. &quot;But who is going to be my lucky partner for tonight? I&#39;m starting to get that unsettled feeling again,&quot; she said, as a paw slowly started to drift down her body.<br />
&quot;I—&quot;<br />
and then Maggie Lawson&#39;s cellphone began to ring.</p>
