<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Johnny looked over at his big brother and smiled, &quot;Whats the matter Ryan? You don't like being the little brother or something? Come on now its not so bad RyRy Im here to protect you!&quot; Johnny said in a sarcastic almost evil tone, Ryan was still very much a twenty year old in his head and he resented and hated the thought of him being treated like a child, or even defended by this abomination of his once younger brother. &quot;Fowock Woo, Jawannwe!&quot; Ryan said, trying deseperatly to sound adult again, but it was no use. he heard what he sounded like, and even he thought he sounded like a toddler trying to swear. he was so humiliated and ashamed at himself, clenched his tiny hands into fist and pounded the floor in anger and frustration.
<br />

<br />
  Eric was in the basement of the old house had found the old electric breaker to the house and  flipped the main breaker bar. All the lights that were in the on position, with bulbs that still worked, came on though out the entire house, Eric was surprized, he did'nt think there was still electricity coming into the house, let alone that it would work at all, he was just fucking around with the damb thing. he smiled and looked around the basement, it was full of bullshit he thought.Mostly old shit that was hopelessly rotting and covered in dust and his most hated of all things cobb webs. That meant spiders! And he hated spiders! It also stank of mildew and moss, he just wanted to go back the way he came. Eric saw a mirror and couldnt help but look at himself in it. He was a handsome specimen of a man, if he had to say so himself, he thought. He did look like a younger version of Bradd Pitt and he knew it, he stoped admirering himself and headed back up the stairs from the basement, he had heard Mumbled yells coming from up stairs and was curious to find out who was talking, he could have sworn he had heard what sounded like a small kids voice. He wasent sure but now that he had the lights on at leist he could see where he was going to find out what it was. 
<br />

<br />
  Eric was a pretty strong guy himself and he wasent frightened easly but this place just gave him the creeps, He tryed to pretend he wasent afraid , but he was, and it showed. He took each step with caution as he went up the stairs, trying to be quiet as he went but with each step that his muscular 6'2&quot; 190Lbs body took the stairs creeked loudly, Eric winced with each step he took, and every creek the stairs made as he did it. Eric finally got to the top. It was just in time to hear the last of the two brothers conversation. He did'nt know it was Johnny and Ryan who were talking. But he could almost make out what they were saying, and he did here Ryans name being used in the conversation. Eric tryed to open the big basement door silently, but it creeked really loudly as it slid open, it sounded like an animal being tortured. He gitted his perfectly white teeth and cringed as it happened. 'Damb' he thought as he slipped though the opening,'I know someone heard that! He whispered to himself. Eric looked around the room that he came into and saw it was the kitchen of the old mansion, it wasent lit but there was enough light comming from the hallway to know it was one, and a dirty one at that. There were dishes still in the sink, but they were totally covered by cobb webs and the old food remains had all but fossilized to the utensils still there.
<br />

<br />
 Eric snuck out of the room and headed for the long hallway where he heard the voices coming from. Once there he peeked around the corner into the long dimmly lit hallway and tryed to figure out which room the voices were coming from. The lights from the rooms that were lit was brighter then the halls light and he saw only three rooms light penetrating the halls floor and walls, he could hear a mans voice he did'nt reconize coming from the second room and he heard what sounded like a small childs voice too. He crept slowly towards the voices, he wished desperatly that Ryan or Mike was with him right now! They were the three amigos, the tough guys of the group. Hell he thought he wouldnt mind if he had little Johnny with him right now, at leist he wouldnt be alone! And right now he felt very much alone. 
<br />

<br />
  Upstairs Mike and Sei were walking around in the dark feeling the walls and freaking out when they ran into cobwebs as they went. Then suddenly the lights came on! &quot;GOD DAMB IT! Fuck that scared the hell out of me!&quot; Mike said angerly as the lights suddenly flashed on here and there. Sei seemed to feel the same way as the two young men looked around the dimly lit hallway. Mike was the oldest and the biggest of the five guys who came into the mansion, he was 6'2&quot; like Ryan was, but he weighed more at 240 Lbs, only not all of his was toned muscle, he was muscular enough but he did have a slight gut going for him. He was still handsome though and never seemed to have a problem getting girls his rugged good looks were an eye catcher where ever he went, and his job as a construction worker helped keep him in good shape dispite his familys natural tendency towards obiesity. He hated his gut and fought mother natures wimb as best as he could. Sie was the only real minority the group of guys to be concidered in the &quot;Ring!&quot; as they called it, he was a very good looking guy. His family came from India, and he had that natural tan that came with decent. his dark thick hair and thick mustash were always trimmed just right and he was quite the ladys man as well. His good looking body did.nt hurt his chances either, he was 6' even and very well built he kept his 185Lbs of weight, fat free and all toned muscle, his dilegent workouts had given him a body that rivaled most international models bodys, and he like the rest was of his group of aduts that came into the mansion, was abit on the conceided side.
<br />

<br />
 They would all soon pay for their arogance and concite towards others. Johnny had come into his own! And with the mind of an eleven year old at that! His imagination was the key to the changes he could inflict on others only he did'nt know it yet, but he would soon figure it out.</p>
