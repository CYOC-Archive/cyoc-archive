<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily decided to adjust his memories to fit in with his new body.<br />
In a moment, he felt himself more comfortable in this body. He realised the younger boy beside him was Miles, a year below. They had bonded over their love of games and Minecraft specifically. Eliot suddenly remembered a life of playing games; Emily had played games before, but not to the extent Eliot apparently had. What had started as two friends joining a server together after school became playing MOBAs, Dark Souls and other such games. He realised Miles was talking about a new Rocket League-style game he had feigned interest in a few weeks ago to placate Miles&#39;s interest in it. Eliot found it funny that knowing what Miles was talking about was why he had changed his memory. Still, it turned out he really didn&#39;t know very much about it at all.<br />
After listening to Miles excitedly talk about the lore for the rest of the ride, they made it to school; Eliot decided to slip into a bathroom before form to get a look at himself properly. <br />
He had just walked into the boys&#39; toilets when he realised he had done it without realising it. This memory rewriting was a lot more encompassing than he realised. What else would he naturally do that he wouldn&#39;t have before? He wondered before making it to the mirror.<br />
He headed to an under-used bathroom for peace while looking at himself for the first time.<br />
The first thing he noticed was how more defined his features were, his cheekbones, his jawline, the bump in his throat, and that he still looked like himself, just as if he had a slightly wider face. He also noticed he had some facial hair, a few hairs across his chin and jaw and then a bit of fuzz on his lip. This filled Eliot with pride, which he found odd. As a girl, he would have never wanted to have facial hair, let alone to feel proud about it. But now he felt almost boastful about it. He thought about the other boys in his form and year. Not all of them can grow facial hair. He remembered he was one of the first who had a visible moustache, and the morning he came in with it shaved for the first time was a subtle sense of pride and manhood. Eliot thought this was probably what it felt like when he had breasts, but when he tried to think about what it felt like having to wear a bra and how it felt when he started showing, he couldn&#39;t quite remember, like it was a step removed from him.<br />
He looked again at his throat and Adam&#39;s apple, once more making him feel older and more mature. He said &#39;Hello&#39; and felt his vocal cords resonate with a richness and bass he could never have reached before. He released a joyous &#39;Ha&#39;, which echoed in the empty bathroom and felt powerful. More powerful than he had ever felt as a girl. Not that he wanted to use his newfound masculinity against people; it was just something he was now more aware of. His height, voice, facial hair, and slightly defined muscles. Eliot thought back to times when he felt intimidated by the boys he now looked, how they&#39;d lean over him or pressure him for dates or his number... and even when walking back from a friend&#39;s house in the dark and having a man walk close behind him for a few streets too many... He needs to make sure not to do that to anyone. <br />
He flexed his muscles for a moment and saw a tuft of hair poking out from his armpits; he pulled back his sleeve to show the amount of hair he now had there and the more prominent trail along his arms. As a girl, he always shaved his armpits, but now he realised how bizarre that thought was; he didn&#39;t have time for that, and besides, it&#39;s not exactly a statement for men to have body hair. It just meant you were more grown up; all men have it, right? <br />
This made him wonder about hair on the rest of his body, something he would&#39;ve been very self-conscious of as Emily but not at all as Eliot. He lifted his shirt to see a smattering along his naval that led down to his new organ. He didn&#39;t want to strip at school, so he quickly peaked below. Beyond the hair, he saw it and realised it felt normal. He&#39;d had it all his life, and today was no different. He remembered memories of being hit in the groin and the pain it caused and then of his first time exploring it. He thought to his female self again and once again came across that degree of separation between himself now and who he was at the start of the morning. It was there, and his memories were there, but he couldn&#39;t quite remember how it felt to be in that body. <br />
He was looking down towards his hairy legs and thinking how much he liked them and his newfound height when the bell rang, and he realised he had to get to form.<br />
He took one last look at himself and headed out.</p>
