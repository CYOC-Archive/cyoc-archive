<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Vect was a little on edge from the previous night&#39;s dream. He prayed that it wasn&#39;t going to come true. He decided to spend the day helping set up some of the pavilions for the travelers that had come with the caravan that hoped to sell some wares to the students and masters at the camp. The next few days were fairly active as the joining ceremony drew closer. Then it came to the night before Sara&#39;s birthday. All the camp was asleep in their bunks and it was quiet. Sara tried to slip out quietly but Vect stopped her. He had been waiting for her to try to leave and insisted he be there with her. &quot;It makes sense for me to be there. I was last time, and who else is going to keep you from waking the whole camp.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? That&#39;s the only reason,&quot; Sara asked as she crossed her arms.<br />
&quot;Yes, would there be any other reason,&quot; Vect lied. <br />
Sara raised an eyebrow, &quot;ok let&#39;s go, I don&#39;t know exactly how much time I&#39;ve got.&quot; She grabbed his hand and practically dragged him along.<br />
After reaching a hill about a quarter of a mile away from the camp the 2 sat down.<br />
&quot;They&#39;re beautiful tonight, aren&#39;t they?&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?,&quot; asked Vect.<br />
&quot;The stars,&quot; she answered as she looked up at the sky.&quot;<br />
Vect looked up to see the vast array of twinkling lights in the black knight sky. No moon was present but the sheer number of stars gave plenty of light. He couldn&#39;t help but start to get a little uncomfortable as he remembered his nightmare. He tried to look for differences when trying to force the memory away failed. &#39;Let&#39;s see, there was a moon, and the camp was nowhere to be found, and she&#39;s wearing a long dress and cloth wraps around her breasts instead of a loincloth, and its-&#39;<br />
&quot;Can I ask you something Vect? And please answer truthfully.&quot;<br />
He paused before nodding.<br />
&quot;Do I scare you?&quot;<br />
&#39;What?&#39; &quot;No no of course not. You&#39;re my friend why would you get an idea like that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;ve been avoiding me these last few days. Vect, I&#39;m scared of what might happen to me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t been....,&quot; he paused for a bit, &quot;ok I have been avoiding you. But it&#39;s not because I&#39;m scared of you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then why?&quot;<br />
&quot;I had a dream about you and me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? Was it hot,&quot; Sara asked as she leaned in close, her curiosity grabbed. She was actually starting to feel a little warm herself.<br />
Vect leaned back, his face beginning to turn red from embarrassment. &quot;I uh....&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on we&#39;ve seen each other naked plenty of times, how could this be any different?&quot;<br />
&quot;Seeing one naked and actually fucking are 2 entirely different things,&quot; he blurted out and immediately realized what he said.<br />
The heat Sara was feeling was rising further. &quot;So there was naughty things happening. Tell me what happened,&quot; she demanded, her short tail waving behind her excitedly.<br />
&quot;Can we just drop it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Come on tell me,&quot; Sara&#39;s face was mere inches from Vect&#39;s. The heat radiating from her.<br />
&quot;Ok! You wanna know what happened,&quot; he snapped as his uneasiness got the better of him. &quot;You held me down, raped me and then tore me apart with a 6 foot cock!&quot;<br />
Sara backed away, the heat flooding her face as it turned red. She covered her face with both hands to cover herself. &quot;Vect I&#39;m so sorry. No wonder you&#39;ve been avoiding me.&quot; She turned away.<br />
Vect placed one hand on her shoulder to turn her around to face him. As she turned he quickly leaned in and kissed her full on the lips. Shocked at first Sara did nothing, but then began to kiss him back. Her heartrate increasing as their tongues intertwined. As they backed off from each other, Vect opened his eyes and saw the redness of Sara&#39;s face begin to spread to the rest of her.<br />
&quot;Its ok Sara. I didn&#39;t want to tell anyone, but it felt good to tell someone. Besides you look great in red,&quot; he added holding up her hand as spots of red spread out to cover any part of her skin. The bright red shade reminded Vect a little of the roses that grew in his family&#39;s garden.<br />
Sara watched as her skin was completely turned bright red. <br />
She did admit to herself, it did have a kind of allure to it. She smiled at her new skin tone and just in time to show Vect her lengthening canines as they resembled fangs. <br />
Vect watched as Sara&#39;s lips took on a rich purple hue standing out vividly from her red skin and white fangs. Sara looked longingly at Vect, &quot;I need your help. I want you, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready.&quot;<br />
She motioned to the tent in her dress front. A small wet spot could be seen by Vect&#39;s superior eyesight. Her member throbbed beneath the fabric as if to beckon Vect closer. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll help, but please don&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;<br />
Sara nodded as she fondled her breasts, the titflesh starting to strain against the wrappings. &#39;What in the 9 hells am I doing? Am I really about to go down on her dick? Gods I&#39;ll never be able to live it down.&#39; Elves already get teased about looking so effeminate and as some humans put it &#39;faggy&#39;. It wasn&#39;t their fault that they never grew facial or body hair and tended to be more slender built than humans and dwarves. Vect breathed in as Sara undid the belt holding her dress up and let it drop to the ground. The member had worked it&#39;s way free of her underwear and stood proudly at 6&quot; in the night air. The head had taken on a purple colour like her lips while the shaft was red like the rest of her, but it still looked like a normal human penis. The balls were still contained in the fabric as it hugged the swollen sack. Thick veins could be seen underneath the skin as Vect pulled the fabric down to Sara&#39;s ankles, the middle soaking wet from her vaginal juices. Sara&#39;s short tail swung lazily behind her. Vect slowly got on his knees and steeled himself for what he was about to do, &#39;it&#39;s for Sara, she is....precious to you. You wanna help her and this is what she needs.&#39; &quot;Just let me know before you cum, ok?&quot; Sara nodded.<br />
Vect slowly opened his mouth and pushed forward, letting the head push open his lips slowly wider as it entered his mouth. Sara let out a gasp, &quot;Vect that feels amazing,&quot; she began to let her tongue hang out of her mouth and felt it lengthen to double its previous length and develop a fork tip. Vect pulled out and then pushed in a little deeper. 2&quot; then 3&quot; entered his mouth, he felt the member throbbing inside him. Without thinking about it,   Vect began to use his tongue to lick and wrap around the shaft as he moved his head back and forth in opposition to Sara&#39;s bucking hips. Sara began to grunt in time to her hip movements. Her tail began to lengthen and thicken drastically as she bucked. In a wave her tail would add a few inches to its length and width, starting at the base and continuing to the tip, each wave pushing the tail tip further from her rounded rear. It didn&#39;t stop growing until it reached 72&quot; long and 8&quot; at the base. The tail swung powerfully behind her, not as dexterous as it used to be, but she guessed she could cause some serious damage if she used it as a weapon. Vect continued to pleasure her, eyes widened as he felt the member push deeper and wider as he went. &#39;Oh gods please don&#39;t come true.&#39; Vect pulled out some to keep from choking on her dick. Further it pushed out until it finally stopped at 8&quot; long and 2 3/4&quot; thick.&quot; Vect cut his eyes up when he heard a tearing of fabric. Sara had used her claws to cut away the wrappings on her breasts, letting them bounce free, they had definitely gotten bigger, at least a cup size or 2 or 3. From between her breasts, vect saw her horns had lengthened and curved more, looking like a ram&#39;s horns. Sara had placed one hand on Vect&#39;s shoulder. Away from view, a pair of bulges began to push out from her back, contained by a thin layer of skin. Her legs thickened up with muscle but had a feminine look as well. As she neared climax the bulges pushed out further. Just before she could say anything about her reaching liftoff, she gasped as the bulges gave way bloodlessly revealing her red wings with black coloured membranes and she reflexively pulled her hand towards her, and Vect along with it. Vect felt Sara&#39;s hand yank him forward, causing him to deep throat her entire member. It was a miracle he didn&#39;t vomit.  Said deep throating pushed Sara over the edge and she let her entire load loose down Vect&#39;s throat. &#39;Gods dammit Sara!&#39; Vect felt his throat get pumped full of Sara&#39;s load for the next minute. Out of desperation for fear of choking, Vect slapped Sara&#39;s ass with all his strength, causing her to look down and realize what she did. She quickly let go of his shoulder and pushed him away. Vect lay on his hands and knees as he tried to catch his breath. He felt her spunk in his belly, seeing it had pushed out slightly from the amount he had drank. &quot;A little warning would.....oh never mind,&quot; he corrected once he saw her large 16&#39; wingspan she had grown. What surprised Vect was the tightening in his pants. &#39;Did I seriously get turned on? What is wrong with me? Wait this feels different from an erection,&#39; Vect thought to himself. He stood up and began to unlace his pants. <br />
&quot;Vect what are you....oh my.....&quot;<br />
Vect dropped his pants and underwear to see the source of his discomfort. He looked in wide eyed shock as his belly shrunk back to normal and his dick and balls expand. Sara liked what she was seeing, &quot;my turn baby,&quot; before Vect could protest, Sara began to use her long tongue to stroke his length. Soon it began to grow to it&#39;s full size of 12&quot; long and 3&quot; wide. Sara began to return the favor to Vect with gusto using her long tongue to full effect. In no time, Vect felt himself about to cum. &quot;Sara I&#39;m gonna...gonna...,&quot; Sara pushed all the way to the hilt and let him return the favor from earlier. &quot;Oh gods, I&#39;m so sorry. That was a lot. Now I know how it felt,&quot; Sara coughed.<br />
&quot;You really didn&#39;t have to do that.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right, but I owed you. How did it feel?&quot;<br />
&quot;It felt better than anything I ever felt before.&quot;<br />
Sara flexed her large bat like wings as her tail flexed behind her. She placed both hands on her hips. &quot;Let&#39;s head back and find some clothes for us, I don&#39;t think these will work anymore.&quot; Her thick legs would help her achieve takeoff and landing easily. <br />
The 2 walked back to camp, holding each other&#39;s hand as they descended the hill.</p>
