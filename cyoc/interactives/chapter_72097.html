<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff read through the message and couldn’t believe that he might change the world into anything they please.  He doesn’t know what to decide on though.  He can turn anyone in the world into sexy big breasted girls, a world filled with anthro animals, robots, mermaids, just about anything!  His options were limitless!  As he was thinking on what he’s going to do, something just hit him.  If he wanted to change the world, he would want to change the world in his own way.  And he knows what he’s going to do.<br />
<br />
See, all Jeff watch all the time is anime.  He always loves anime, ever since he was a little kid.  He use to watch shows like Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Yo, Bayblade, and all other kid like anime shows.  He even watches anime adaptation of American shows such as Teen Titans, Totally Spies, and even Avatar.  At late night, he would start to watch adult like animes on Adult Swim and record most of it on his DVR to see what he had miss while he was asleep.  Being that he is older, he understood what adult anime is like.  Mostly violent, it has little sex, nudity, and girls that have big boobs.  Guess he knows what adult anime means.<br />
<br />
But looking into all of the anime shows, he always wondered what it would be like if he was in an anime like world.  Going through many adventures and many types of dangers, exploring the world he had always dream of, even spending time with women with big breasts.  That would’ve been so much better then the life he always have.  Everyday going to the same school, the same family, the same activities, the same life; it’s just plain boring.  He wanted a life where each day is as exciting as the next.  With his dream of living in a world that is anime like and with the Chronivac in his possession, it might give him the life he really wants.<br />
<br />
Looking at his options, he finds it to be very simple.  There was a big box that says what the world you envision would be like followed by a few simple decisions like the duration of the transformation, awareness of the your change, and when will it end.  But the main text box is the one he has to be careful of.  One little slip up would ultimately cost him some serious trouble.  Looking into the text box, he begins to ponder on what he would write about.  After thinking this through, he came up with a good decision and pressed his hands on the keyboard.  He started to type…<br />
<br />
‘If I want to change the world to whatever I need, I want it to be an anime world.  Not like a specific anime show or a genre of anime, but a world where every type, genre, and show all merge into one big world.  No matter where you go, every city, country, it’s always anime.  Everyone around the world would change into an anime character based on the traits or fantasies they have.  For example, if the person is an animal lover, then he or she is a pokemon trainer.  If the person were learning karate, then he or she would become a skilled fighter.  If someone has erotic or sexual fantasies, then that person would become buxom anime girl whether they are male or female.  If there were children between the ages of 5 and newborn, they would become chibi versions of themselves.  The list goes on and on.  What makes this better is that everything they will do will be normal for them.  Whether they are piloting mechs, having ariel fights, battling with Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Yo cards, or feeling horny, it will all be natural for them.  Finally, every house, building, or city would look like a different type of anime genre whether it is all futuristic, horror, Futu schools, or erotic.  The same goes with cars, trees, and other variety of inanimate objects.  That’s what I want to change the world.’<br />
<br />
After typing the whole thing, he began to reread it to see if he had made any mistake.  Looking through all of it, he nodded and knew he was ready.  He just needs to take care of a few things.  He looked at the other options that he needed to do.<br />
<br />
The fist thing he checked the duration of the transformation.  He knows that he can make the changes go on or either a minute of a full year.  Rubbing his chin, he wondered what how long would he make the change.  He doesn’t want to do it too quick or too slow; he just wants to do it just right.  Thinking this through, Jeff decided to make the change five minutes that way he can see the transformation of himself and the room around him.<br />
<br />
The next option is the awareness option.  That would mean that he, or everyone around the world would be aware of the changes or not.  He wants to be aware of the changes but not everyone else because if that happens it would be a major panic across the globe.  So he decided to type down, ‘I will be aware of the changes and no one else.’<br />
<br />
The last thing he had to check is when the day of change would finish.  Meaning when he would let this new world end for him.  It can range from a day to a lifetime.  Now this is a very difficult choice for him.  He wants to live in an anime world but he doesn’t know how long he wants it to be.  Leaving it forever could be a good option, but he won’t know if he would like it or not.  So just to be on the safe side, he decided to let this last for a day.  That way if he doesn’t like it, the day will end and everything would be back to normal.<br />
<br />
He looked through the stuff all over again to see if he wants to make some last minute decisions.  After looking through the stuff, he nodded and knew what to do next.  He moved the mouse pointer to the ‘Start’ icon and clicked on it.  The moment he did that, a window appeared and said, ‘Thanks for your decision.  The transformation will start immediately.  Enjoy your new world.’  Below it is a time counter that says five minutes and it was counting down.  Jeff felt excited about it as he waited for the changes to begin.  When the countdown started, he felt a tingle in his body.  He knew it is actually starting and went to the mirror to see for himself.  What he saw is amazing.<br />
<br />
Looking on, he noticed that his body was growing a little bit and it appears to be gaining some muscles.  He knew that he was a little lackey and started to work out bit by bit.  But now this is a whole different story.  Now he looked like he was in a medium build, not to bulky, strong enough of a teenager.  He could even see his clothes changing along with his body.  His shirt expanded and the color faded to while with a hard cloth texture.  It then started to open up in the middle and wrapped around his body, making it look like a rope of some kind.  His jeans puffed up as well and looked baggy, changing color and texture to the same as his shirt.  A black belt appeared around him and tied itself up tight, fitting his new clothes.  His shoes and socks disappeared, leaving him completely barefooted, which made Jeff feel a little uncomfortable but let it slide.  Then other things appeared on his attire as well.  Patches appeared on his shoulders and across his chest his Japanese markings and a karate logo.  Jeff looked at all of it and realized what the clothes really were.  He was wearing a karate uniform that looked really professional.  <br />
<br />
Looking on, he remembered something.  Last year, he enrolled into a karate class just to learn to defend himself.  Now with the changes happening around him, it made him into a real third degree black belt, something Japanese karate masters have.  It’s making his dream come true.  But all this was only the beginning.  The real changes are about to begin.<br />
<br />
Looking into the mirror, he noticed that something strange happened.  Looking into the mirror, he saw his face was looking more animated.  His eyes started to look really big and very wide.  His nose started to shrink and looked like it was almost disappeared.  But oddly enough, he was still breathing.  His lips were completely vanished, leaving nothing but a mouth.  He looked at the rest of his body and noticed that it was animated too.  Looking more cartoonish then real life actually.  When the changes are done, he looked exactly like an anime teenager.<br />
<br />
Looking back, he also saw that his room changed.  He still has the desk, computer, and a TV with him, though it looked a little differently, but everything else has changed.  His bed was replaced with a mattress like bed on the floor with a blanket on it, something Japanese people used to sleep.  The room itself looked like a little dojo complete with a mat like floor, a punching back on the side, a few weights to lift his arms, and a wooden pole with sticks around it to do quick punches and blocks.  With the timer finished counting down, Jeff knew that the changes were all done.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked around and couldn’t believe that the Chronivac actually did all that.  He was now living in an anime like world.  He looked down at himself and turned his hand, realizing that it was his real hand.  Tightening his fist, he wondered if he could pull some sweet moves.  So he started to practice and found out it was real natural to him.  Once, his practice was a little sloppy, but now it was completely different.  He was doing flips, spins, and punches with the greatest of ease and he didn’t slip up one bit.  When he finished, he smiled widely and liked this change.  “Hmm…” he said to himself, “Maybe this won’t be bad at all.”<br />
<br />
As he was enjoying himself, he heard his mother’s voice, only a little younger.  “Jeff!  Lunch is ready!  Come down here!”  Jeff blinked a couple of times and was surprised by the sound of her voice.  So he turned to the door and responded, “Okay mom!  I’m coming!”  He hurried to the door and slides it out, realizing that it was a Japanese tradition.  As he headed downstairs, he wondered what other changes took place.</p>
