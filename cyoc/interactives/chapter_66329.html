<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jefferson stared at the two very muscular eight-year-old boys. Their bodies had been transformed into the epitome of muscular growth. What was left of their clothing was turned into form fitting workout gear that hugged every part of their muscular &quot;little&quot; bodies. The toy trucks and cars were changed into miniature set weights and the sand box was turned into an outdoor workout area.  <br />
<br />
Beside the workout area, where the two overly muscular grade schoolers were working out, sat the mother of the twins. She was mending their torn clothing that they keep out growing. &quot;Timmy and Jimmy don't forget to practice your posing routines. You’re the preshow entertainment at the Olympia tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy.&quot; The two said in unison. <br />
<br />
The two boys proceeded to go into their posing routine before taking off their outer workout gear. It was a stereophonic ripping sound coming from the workout area that got their mothers attention. When she looked back at her &quot;little men&quot; all she saw were two nearly naked twin boys dressed in only a matching pair royal blue posing trunks. &quot;Sorry Mommy.&quot; All she could do was smile as she went back to her sewing knowing that she had now more to do.<br />
<br />
Just twenty feet away the play area stood Ty, Jake and Jefferson.  Jefferson had just witness the transformation of two boys into miniature versions of two heavy weight bodybuilders. He had seen transformation of gifs on the internet before but they looked like cartoons compared to the real thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not possible.&quot; Jefferson said disbelief.  &quot;It goes against all the laws of evolution. Their just kids but they look like full grown adult bodybuilders compared to the other kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I never studied law.&quot; Ty said replied lightly jabbing Jake with his elbow. <br />
<br />
&quot;But they don't look like adults  . . . yet.&quot; Jake motions to Ty to take a closer look. &quot;Ty, I think you forgot something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D’oh!&quot; Ty slaps his own forehead. &quot;That's the most important part, the package.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back over at the kiddy workout area the two boys began to get a funny feeling between their legs. The tiny nonexistent bulges in their posers began to grow bigger and bigger. As quickly as it started their bulges stopped growing. In place of the normal size cock belonging to an eight-year-old, each boy now had one belonging to an eighteen-year-old male. All the added testosterone that was now being produced their larger package would soon had an effect on their &quot;little&quot; bodies.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;There, now that everyone has the complete package what do you think?&quot; Ty asked Jefferson.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I think they look like two freaks with all that bulging muscle.&quot; Jefferson said looking Ty straight in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may say that you think they look like freaks but your body is sending a different message.&quot; Jake said to Jefferson. Then he whispered into Jefferson's ear. &quot;You might want to 'calm down' a little too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about I'm not . . .&quot; <br />
<br />
It took Jefferson a second to get the innuendos that Ty and Jake were throwing his way. It took him even longer to figure out that the two eight-year-olds weren't only ones that grew, that is until he tried to check out his own package. When he looked down there was something blocking his view, it was his own bare chest. He tried to reached up and touch his chest but something was blocking his arms. He raised his own arm up from the sides and saw that they had grown too. Frantically he checked out the rest of his now larger body. Just like the two eight-year-olds he had grown just as big, right down to the large bulge in his royal blue posing trunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done, I like a freak.&quot; Jefferson said in a panic. &quot;I don't want all these muscles. I just want to be a normal looking teenager. How can I be normal with a dick this big?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look as normal as everyone else here.&quot; Jake tells Jefferson.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What about the two muscle kids over there?&quot; Jefferson said as he points back to the two muscle boys without looking.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I see are a bunch of teenagers working out at the new workout area that the city built for us.&quot; Ty said. <br />
 <br />
What Jefferson didn't see when his back was turned was the changes that Ty had set into motion. The two muscular eight-year-olds had grown ten years older. Their bodies had grown to six feet in height and gained a hundred and fifty pounds of vascular muscle. Their larger workout area was now populated by several of the guys that Ty had changed earlier.  Ty had even seen fit to change their workout attire to the same royal blue posers. All their muscular teen bodies were a glow with sweat from their workouts.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I thought that . . . I mean . . .  what happened to . . .  ?&quot; Jefferson couldn't remember what he was going to say. His mind was askew with conflicting thoughts. He remembers waking up this morning as a small fourteen-year-old boy. But how is that possible, he was never that small. He was always big for his age like everyone else in here in school. No he doesn't go to school here he is home schooled. He has lived a very sheltered life because of his . . . his  . . . his wanting to be bigger.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jefferson . . .&quot; Ty said snapping his fingers in front of Jefferson's face. &quot;Are you going to stand around all day or are we going to work out?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;After all you can't get muscle like these just by wishing for them.&quot; Jake said going into a double biceps pose.<br />
<br />
The three teens head for the workout area and joined Tim and Jim, the new instructors for the workout area. Ty and Jake peeled off their outer layer of clothing revealing royal blue posers, which happened to be the same color of the schools bodybuilder team.</p>
