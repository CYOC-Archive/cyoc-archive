<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex snarls, bringing his head close to Eli&#39;s. He must learn to love the pack, and accept all that comes with it. The werewolf licks the hunter&#39;s cheek, rubbing his fur against the human&#39;s smooth skin. Waiting for him to calm down and accept his fate, which slowly happens. Eli stops fighting the wolves, no longer trying to free himself from Alex&#39;s grip. Just staying still for the beast that&#39;s currently pinning him, Alex giving an appreciatory growl as he lines up his sheath with the man’s ass. Red tip already poking in as Eli grunts, but reacts no further.<br />
<br />
The sensations Eli begins to feel are unlike anything he has felt before. He has experienced a man&#39;s cock in his ass. But to feel one enter and grow brings an entire new sensation. The lupine dick small to start, barely filling the human, until it balloons by the second. Stretching Eli as it grows and pushes against his insides. Locked past his rim with no hope of being pulled out. The two are bound, and the pack erupts into triumphant howls.  The alpha and his companion smirking, finally they&#39;ve got their vengeance on this damn hunter. He&#39;s going to be part of the pack. A special member in fact, one to make up for all his days hunting them or scaring them away from their prey. <br />
<br />
Alex starts to pound into Eli. It starts with a single hard slam to gauge his reaction. Forcing his cock further in, and squishing the humans body against the grassy floor. The hunter strong enough to hold back a pained gasp, tensing his hands as the werewolf repeats the action. Alex&#39;s head still near Eli&#39;s, as he once more snuggles against the man. The humans head turning to see the werewolf that&#39;s pressing against him. Looking into his emerald eyes, as he starts to return the affectionate gesture.<br />
<br />
The pace of Alex&#39;s thrusts slowly increases as the two rub against each other. The werewolf&#39;s larger body slamming into the smaller hunter underneath him. Eli is by no means a weak man, but compared to the werewolf he is a twig. Half the size of the brutish beast that&#39;s laying into him. Enduring the rough fucking as Alex works even harder. Letting his need to breed and spread take over entirely. The monster no longer thinking, just shoving his dick in and out of the human’s ass.<br />
<br />
Eli feels the curse of lycanthropy reaching for him. His nails growing sharper to claws, his body sprouting fur. He was infected the moment Alex planted his dick inside him, and their sex has only accelerated the curse. The turning wolf grunting and growling under the barrage of the stronger male. Kept in his place under the bigger wolf. Not able to struggle free, not wanting to struggle free. The rising instincts in the new packmate telling him that this is his place, to take the cocks of the pack’s warriors.<br />
<br />
As the fur continues to claim Eli, his body starts to shrink. His hunters physique, meaty and broad, diminishing to a much thinner build. Going from showy muscles to barely any visible muscle at all. Smooth and tight torso, unimpressive yet still long arms, sturdy yet thin legs. The hunter thankful that he is at least staying the same height, Alex not needing to move at all to continue his bestial breeding of the new packmate. <br />
<br />
As Alex continues to slam into him. Eli&#39;s rear end begins resizing, making space for Alex&#39;s enflamed knot. No longer tightly pressing against him, but instead fitting like it&#39;s supposed to. Still rubbing against him, but not stretching him beyond his capabilities. A satisfied yelp escaping Eli&#39;s forming muzzle, head pressing forward and ears rising to points. Tail growing and squishing against the stronger wolfs bulky body. Fur claiming his entire form as it is hidden in an endless sea of black hairs.<br />
<br />
A tingling sensation greets the former hunter’s groin. Cock previously rutting against grass, now hidden in a furry sheath. Tip poking against the dirt, emerging in full as his own knot enflames. Locked between his furred chest and the forest floor, moving along with his body whenever Alex does a hard thrust into him. Helping him slowly find his own release, as the bigger wolf is unrelenetless in his movements.<br />
<br />
The new wolf digs his claws into the dirt, paw pads resting against the grass as he lets his packmate finish inside him. Alex slamming in one last time, holding tightly onto his friend’s hips as he empties himself, then rolls onto his side. Taking Eli along with him, as the newer werewolf&#39;s cock dribbles out its own load onto the grass. The two men still bound by the stronger wolfs knot, and still embracing one another. <br />
<br />
Alex holds onto the smaller wolf, Eli resting his head against his packmates strong body. The two having hurried breaths, tongues lolling from their mouth as they enjoy the aftermath of a good fuck. The rest of the pack gathering, giving the same treatment to Eli as they did to Alex. Running up to him. Embracing him. Kissing him. He is the runt of the pack, the younger inexperienced wolf that&#39;s more useful in bed than on their runs. But he is still their family, and they love him the same. <br />
<br />
The alpha watches from the distance, satisfied to see his enemy&#39;s downfall. The hunter that gave him so much trouble reduced to a weaker wolf in the pack. While the puny human he tried to protect grew into a strong huntsman. He smirks, then joins in the celebration. Welcoming the newest wolf, then howling to signal another hunt for the night. Eli and Alex responding to their alpha&#39;s command, the humans they once were not even a distant memory, as they move to all fours and race off into the woods.</p>
