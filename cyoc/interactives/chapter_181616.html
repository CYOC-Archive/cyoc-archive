<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday morning was late. Janette finally stirred from a beam of sunlight around eleven in the morning. She was in a pleasant mood and her body felt even better. It’s not every weekend you spend with the girl of your dreams and figure out your sexuality.<br />
<br />
Friday night had filled with a beautiful date and her first time making love with another girl. She’d been nervous and unskilled but Maria had taken charge and shown her the ropes. By Saturday night Janette had been doing a pretty good job pleasuring Maria.<br />
<br />
Saturday had seen more delicious and exotic food, she’d been shown all Maria’s architecture designs and just seeing the results of the girl’s passions had set her heart ablaze. They’d listened to some beautiful music, gone out to another restaurant, and Janette had tried on some of Maria’s clothes.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm,” she smiled, pulling the blankets around her but finding they were a little less soft and a little smellier maybe. “If today turns out like the rest of the weekend I may just have to marry you.”<br />
<br />
Her response was snoring, loud obnoxious and masculine snoring. She opened her eyes and felt horror creep into her body. Maria’s room was gone.<br />
<br />
The beautiful dresses were no more, the collection of Spanish music had vanished, and worst of all her sweet Mexican beauty had turned back into Mason.<br />
<br />
The architecture drawings had vanished, the room was a lot less clean, and all those beautiful flowers and cacti had just evaporated. She sat up, wrapped in blandly coloured bedsheets and felt a sense of gripping loss in her heart. She wanted to cry, her love was gone.<br />
<br />
Mason was disturbed by her awakening and he smiled as he cracked an eye open, staring lustfully at her naked body.<br />
<br />
“Hey beautiful,” he flirted, his manly hand touching her shoulder but not creating an electric spark of glee that Maria had. The bedsheets tented and he smiled. “Who’s ready for another round.”<br />
<br />
“Another round?” She asked before he sat up and leaned over, kissing her on the lips.<br />
<br />
Nothing, she suddenly felt nothing. She’d just been kissed by the boy she’d drooled over for three years and she just felt loss. It didn’t get better from there. She’d dreamed of riding Mason’s cock for years but the second d it was inside her she didn’t really feel much. She wanted to lay on Maria’s soft breasts, run her tongue inside her womanly folds, and feel her soft lips pressing onto her own. She didn’t like Mason’s meat inside her vagina, she didn’t like it or the taste of his seed in her mouth, and when it was up her butt she mostly felt pain. She didn’t like cuddling with him in the afterglow, he was too big and not curvy enough. He just felt wrong.<br />
<br />
She wanted to cry, depression eating at her as she sat at Mason’s kitchen table, mourning her gorgeous desert flower, gone once Mason finished digesting her potion. There was so much she wanted to tell her, experience with her, and learn from her.<br />
<br />
“I need comfort food,” she sniffled before ordering a bag of tacos from a cheap Mexican place. She couldn’t remember the names of any of the good ones and that made her cry as she chewed on her comfort food. It tasted horrible, she wanted the real stuff, she wanted to be with Maria.<br />
<br />
“As sweet, tacos,” Mason announced after he’d left the shower. She wanted to scream at him to go away, and she hated him even more when he took a bite of one of her tacos and said it was good. No it wasn’t, Maria would have hated it. He was an idiot and she just wanted him to go away.<br />
<br />
He stood before her all happy, unwrapping a second taco, but the second he took a bite of his second one he recoiled as if it tasted bad. Janette cried into her knees, completely oblivious as Mason shrunk a little, his height falling to that of Maria’s. his hair sprouted down his back in beautiful wavy curls and turned cocoa, his skin took on a tanned tone and his face lost his Asian features. Big breasts swelled from his chest, his hips flared out, and his equipment reversed itself into that of a woman. His shirt and pants merged together and formed into a beautiful white dress with floral patterns on it, and he shook his head.<br />
<br />
The room changed, messes cleaning up, plants popping into existence, and architecture designs appearing on a drafting table and in sketchbooks on her desk. Her clothes turned into those she’d brought from home, and her voice turned accented and completely disgusted.<br />
<br />
“You call that a taco!” She complained. “This is an insult to my country’s cuisine. My mother would have the head of any chef who thought this was any good.”<br />
<br />
Janette sat up straight and turned around, finding Mason gone and replaced with Maria, his apartment transformed into hers.<br />
<br />
“Maria!” Janette squeed before rushing up to the girl and embracing her in a tight hug. She cried tears of joy while Maria patted her on the back I. Confusion. “Why did you change back?!”<br />
<br />
“Change... back?” Maria asked in confusion before Janette noticed the taco.<br />
<br />
“Mexican food! You transform when you eat Mexican food!” She exclaimed in giddy excitement.<br />
<br />
“This is not Mexican food!” Maria ranted while waving the half eaten taco around. “I will show you real Mexican food. By the time I’m done with you you won’t be able to stand anything else.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes! Please! Let’s eat it every night so you never change back,” Janette exclaimed while feeling her heart flutter.<br />
<br />
“What has gotten into you?” Maria asked before Janette took the taco from her hands and threw it in the trash, planting her lips on Maria’s and pressing their bodies close.<br />
<br />
“I love you,” Janette whispered before the kissing got more intense, too intense, Janette couldn’t take it anymore and stripped Maria’s clothes off, pushing her back on the couch and beginning to push her fingers in and out of her girl’s body. Maria got flustered and started moaning and saying things in Spanish, but that only made Janette hornier and made her fingerbang her girl harder.<br />
<br />
When Maria came Janette eagerly lapped up her juices, kissing the folds of her lower lips and toying with her clit using her tongue. Maria was sweaty and blushing by the time she was done. Then it was Janette’s turn and Maria played with her large breasts with a big smile, kneading them around, massaging them until they felt numb and pleasurable, and toying with the nipples using her tongue.<br />
<br />
It was so much better than with Mason, Janette was biting her lip and moaning, loving the feel of rubbing Maria’s soft womanly rear end, and gasping whenever she reached a climax and let out a squirt of love juices. She felt good, it didn’t hurt or fail to satisfy her, and when she cuddled with Maria afterwards she felt so warm and comfortable. She was happy and after the blushes faded and they felt ready to move again she slipped into one of Maria’s outfits feeling in love with the fabric and design.<br />
<br />
“Ready for some real Mexican cuisine?” Maria asked once they were all dressed up and done their makeup.<br />
<br />
“Any time,” Janette sighed before taking Maria’s hand and walking out the door with her.</p>
