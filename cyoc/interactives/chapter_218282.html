<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff clenched his fists and felt tears welling up in his eyes.<br />
Frustration and fear clouded his mind and he felt like he wanted to scream.<br />
<br />
So much had happened in such a short time. He had gone from being a completely ordinary teenage boy to the victim of an involuntary sexual reassignment surgery all within a week. And it was all the fault of some impossible magical shop that seemed to disappear just as suddenly as it had arrived.<br />
<br />
It was all too much. His entire body began to tremble. Whether it was fear or rage, Jeff wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
Just then, Jeff remembered he still had the magic stone. Maybe it could fix his problems, even if the chance was minute. Anything was better than this. Without thinking about it, he climbed off his bed and went to retrieve the last piece of his power. The Magic Stone.<br />
<br />
When he returned to his room he sat upon his bed and opened the cardboard box, nervously fumbling the stone out of its tissue paper wrapping. Clenching it in a hard fist, he suddenly felt the familiar but still harsh feeling of being swept into a new reality.<br />
<br />
Jeff found himself standing in a professional looking room, staring at a young Latino receptionist behind a marble counter. Guadalajara plastic surgery center, the signs behind the young man read. “Señor Paul, you’re here for masculinizing gender affirming surgery, yes?” Jeff was still in a daze. “Hola, Señor? Are you okay?” The young man asked after a few seconds. He gestured toward the sofa before sitting himself down across from the visibly confused man.<br />
<br />
“Umm…Yeah I guess so,” Jeff stammered, not entirely understanding. “It’s okay, it can be a lot. But remember you’re taking this step for you, to become the man you know you are. Think of how well you did last time, for down there.” He gestured at Jeff’s crotch. “We just have to finish the job.” Jeff noticed the bulge in his pants, was this really it?? He quickly excused himself to the restroom to examine his new situation. “Hurry back, alright señor? Your appointment is in 20 minutes and I need to get you prepped. Doctor is waiting.”<br />
<br />
Jeff quickly pulled down his pants. Underwear too. Looking up at him was still a now familiar feeling opening. A silicone penis filled out his bulge. Jeff was confused. Pulling out his wallet he looked at the ID card. A strong masculine face with blonde hair an a beard looked back at him. Michael Paul, gender: F, birthday 4 June, 1989, height 5’5”, weight 180lbs. Jeff pulled off his shirt, he knew his chest felt odd, around his barreling masculine features he was wearing a binder. He was in the body of a short, stocky, trans-man! <br />
<br />
His groin was now going to be as it should be, he thought. Why else would he be here? Jeff sat down on the toilet and allowed himself a moment of self-examination.<br />
<br />
Jeff would never have chosen this particular transformation, but he couldn’t argue with the fact that he would have a penis again. Whatever changes this guy had in mind we’re certain going in the right direction. The receptionist said they were finishing the job? <br />
<br />
“Señor? It’s time.” Jeff, now Michael, heard from outside. As he exited the restroom, he saw the doctor waiting patiently. Dr. Lopez seemed friendly enough, it was probably just his overly chipper demeanor, just how everyone acts when treating a client. Jeff changed into a gown and was wheeled into the pre-op room. “Everything is going to be okay, we’ll get you fixed up…” the doctor reassured him as he drifted off.<br />
<br />
When Jeff awoke, it was dark outside. He couldn’t tell though because his face was bandaged. He tried to move but was unable to. He could feel the casts around his skull, chest, feet and hands. This operation was obviously more than a simple ftm bottom surgery. No, Michael wanted  more extensive modifications, and Jeff would have to witness them.<br />
<br />
So far he hadn’t been able to fully understand the full scope of what the procedure entailed. His memory slowly faded.<br />
<br />
Days passed. At least he assumed they had, he lost track of time. There were no windows or clocks in his field of view, but he could count the number of times the nurse came in to change his feeding bag. <br />
<br />
On what he felt was day four, the surgeon returned. Today he would get his bandages removed. They told him his (well Michael’s) husband was here to visit.  Just another happy customer, the doctor thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Sitting up a little, Jeff took note of his body. His chest was the first thing to have the bandages removed. He didn’t know what to think about the massive pectoral implants that now adorned his frame. Further down, Jeff noticed a line of four little nipples, each coming from one of his new 8-pack abs. His belly button was gone, just a little scar remained.<br />
<br />
Next, his extensively changed legs were revealed. Huge implants now covered the tops of both of his thighs, as well as his calves. New muscular shins rose out of those substantial quads. Both legs ended in new size 13 feet, each of which had permanently implanted black rubber soles that would keep him firmly planted while he walked on concrete floors. The black rubber met his skin on the back of his toes, where his toenails once were.<br />
<br />
His arms were changed in a similar way, but no less intense. Gone were the skinny fingers, replaced by short, thick ones, sprouting out from a thick rubbery palm. The hand itself was now incredibly powerful, something about it was incredibly masculine, though mechanical. His forearms bulged with muscles to control his new digits. Powerful shoulders connected his thick biceps to his barrel chest.<br />
<br />
With so much new muscle, the old man had disappeared entirely. His skin felt odd all over, the doctor explained that the bovine follicle grafts he had requested were taking well and his new body hair would be sprouting soon.<br />
<br />
Turning to look down, Jeff couldn’t help but let out a sigh of awe. Now it made sense why his (Michael’s) stomach stuck out like that. As for Jeff’s face, yes, it still looked pretty much the same, however the process had changed things drastically. Jeffrey Johnson’s skull now carried two big horns on either side.<br />
<br />
The only part that wasn’t changed was his pussy. Merely adapted to his new form, his groin still carried his fat hairy pussy lips and little clit.</p>
