<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richelle:<br />
<br />
I was up earlier than I usually was on a school day. I was nervous at the prospect of going to a new school. I wondered how much the students had been changed by aliens. How many would still look human? I would have to wait until I got there to find out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you up Richelle!?!&quot; Mom asked through my door. &quot;I saw your light on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, I'm up Mom!&quot; I said. &quot;You can come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom came in and looked around. I had cleaned my room a bit after we got back from getting me new clothes. I had boxed up all my old clothes and actually put away my new clothes. &quot;I'm going to miss the old you&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and me both&quot; I said. &quot;I would like to change back but this isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I get to see a naked girl just about anytime I want now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm curious about something since you kind of brought it up&quot; Mom said. &quot;Are you straight?&quot;<br />
<br />
That question took me back a bit. Of course I was straight and Mom knew that. Then I thought about it a little bit. I was a girl now and I didn't know if I was attracted to guys now or not. How would my body react? I thought about a girl I really liked. Usually when I thought about her my heart would start skipping beats. This time I didn't feel anything. &quot;I think that I'm still straight&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well just be careful what boys you fall for&quot; Mom said. &quot;I don't want to get a call saying that your boyfriend killed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a boyfriend Mom&quot; I said blushing a bit. &quot;Besides, I can take care of myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll find that you are weaker than boys&quot; Mom said. &quot;It's just the way things are. Girls are naturally weaker in general.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're forgetting that I have some abilities now&quot; I said. &quot;I can take care of myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you can&quot; Mom said smiling. &quot;You better get ready as long as you're up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; I said as she left and closed the door. I had taken a shower last night so I didn't need to worry about that. I got dressed in a matching pair of pink lace panties and bra. I chose a light pink tee shirt and a pleated denim skirt. I chose a pair of plain white ankle socks. I looked in a full length mirror that we had bought yesterday. I had to admit that I was a good looking girl. I picked up my hair brush that we had also bought yesterday and brushed my hair. I still couldn't believe that I was a girl now but it was slowly starting to sink in. I put on my shoes, grabbed my<br />
purse, and went to the dining room for breakfast.<br />
<br />
After breakfast I was waiting for Friday to show up. I was getting a little nervous waiting. What if he was joking about the new school? What if he was joking about being able to change everyone's memories?<br />
<br />
A car pulled up and Friday got out. I looked at Mom and said &quot;I'll see you after school. I'll let you know if I decide to stay at the school or come home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok honey&quot; Mom said.<br />
<br />
I left my house and got into the car. I noticed that Nash was in the front passenger seat and that gave me pause. Seeing me Friday said &quot;Don't worry about Agent Nash. He won't do anything. He is on probation right now. An incident like yesterday will land him a desk job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that puts me at ease&quot; I said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad&quot; Friday said. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not.<br />
<br />
We picked up Stephanie on the way. She had the same reaction that I did. Nash didn't so much as glance at her. Come to think of it, he didn't glance at me either. It took an hour to get to our new school.<br />
<br />
As we pulled up we could see that the school looked like an ordinary school if that school was a mansion. It was huge. From the outside though you'd never guess that this school housed students who were transformed by aliens. It looked like it was composed of brick but something told me that there was more to it. Friday and Nash got out of the car and we did the same. They led us inside and I concentrated on memorizing every detail as I may need to teleport. The entrance had columns that were made of marble. The ceiling was about forty feet high and there was a balcony about half way up. I saw a girl up there with flaming hair literally, her hair was fire. I wondered how she slept at night. We went down a long hall that was<br />
interspersed with doors. Behind some of them we could hear classes being taught. Most were the regular type of classes you'd see in any school but there were some that were different. Behind one I was able to hear some of a lecture about the responsible use of powers. Evidently Stephanie and I weren't the only ones that had powers. Finally we come to one door and Friday and Nash went in. We followed them into the school's office.<br />
<br />
Friday approached a secretary and said &quot;We brought the new students.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; the secretary said. I saw a plaque that said 'Doris Fuller'. &quot;You can leave them here and I'll make sure that they speak with the Headmistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure that they know the rules of this school&quot; Nash said with a dark tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't need to tell me how to do my job Agent&quot; Miss Fuller said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm just warning you that they could be a problem&quot; Nash said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's enough Agent Nash!&quot; Friday said. &quot;They know how to do their job. Don't forget that you are on probation.&quot; The redness that came to Nash's face at these words told me that Friday had intentionally let that slip.<br />
<br />
Nash just turned around and stalked off. I was getting a bad feeling about this. Friday turned to us and said &quot;You two listen to the professors here. They're good at their jobs. I'll stop by later to see how you're doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he turned to leave I grabbed his arm and said &quot;Be careful of Nash. I think you dressing him down here might have been too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Friday smiled and said &quot;Thank you for your concern. I can assure you that I can handle him. This isn't the first time he's been put on probation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes me feel so much better&quot; I said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be careful&quot; Friday said seriously. That just made me even more worried.<br />
<br />
I let go of Friday's arm and he walked out. We were told to sit down so we did. We were sitting there for fifteen minutes before we were led into the Headmistress's office. It was a rather large room with several portraits around it. I guessed that these were past Headmasters and Headmistresses. At the far end was a woman who appeared to be in her mid thirties sitting behind a desk.<br />
<br />
The woman looked up at us and said &quot;Please, sit down you two.&quot; After we had sat down she said &quot;Now I understand that you wish to enroll here. Now I have your names as Stephanie Harriette Thornwall and Richelle Marie O'Toole. Is that correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Stephanie said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; the woman said. &quot;If you haven't figured it out by now I am the Headmistress here. You may call me Headmistress or Professor McDoohan. While you are here you will call the professors sir, ma'am, or professor. The secretaries are also professors and teach. We don't have a uniform here. We allow you to dress how you want as long as it's within reason. You can wear items that have a political bent. It can even be religious. Now Miss O'Toole, Miss Thornwall, one<br />
of our students will show you around today. Her name is Angelica Jones. She should be coming in any second now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Professor McDoohan finished speaking the door opened and in walked the girl I had seen earlier. I had read Marvel Comics before and I thought that Angelica had been transformed based on the Angelica Jones, AKA Fire Star, from the comic books. I may have to ask later. The sound of Professor McDoohan speaking turned me back around. &quot;Miss Jones will show you the school and the dorms&quot; she said. &quot;You are dismissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie and I rose and followed Angelica out. Before we got too far she said &quot;Before you ask, aliens did this to me. They found one of my brothers comic books and came up with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Based on Angelica Jones&quot; I said. &quot;Otherwise known as Fire Star.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Angelica said. &quot;I have her powers but the aliens decided that it would be funny to give me flames for hair. When I go out in public I have to wear a special wig. I even have to wear a special cap to bed and even then the bedding and bed need to be special. This is the only place that has what I need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don't have much of a choice&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;At least they didn't change your gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is that&quot; Angelica said. &quot;I take it that you were a guy before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both were&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll fit in here then&quot; Angelica said. &quot;A lot of the students here were the opposite gender before. At first they have trouble adjusting but they soon get used to it. The new guys have just as much trouble adjusting as the new girls. I'll show you the dorms first. Then we'll head to lunch. I'll continue the tour of the school after lunch. The last thing will be the school nursery and the school doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;They have a nursery here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they do&quot; Angelica said. &quot;Understand that sometimes the aliens impregnate people. It isn't only the girls they impregnate either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a scary thought&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
Presently we came to the dorm rooms. Angelica opened one up to show us. &quot;This one is my room&quot; she said. &quot;As you can see we can pretty much decorate how we want within reason. This is a single occupancy room. We do have double occupancy which are a bit bigger than this. Each room comes with a microwave, small fridge, and small freezer. Perfect for those late night snacks. We can leave campus whenever we<br />
want. So going out for pizza is easy though we don't have pizza delivered. Oh! I almost forgot. Each room also has an internet connection. Now, the baths here are dual sex. Any questions so far?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None so far&quot; I said as I looked at Angelica's room. It was bigger than most hotel rooms. Angelica had several posters on the wall. A few of them were of Halle Berry as Storm from the X-Men movies. She had some Insane Clown Posse posters. There was one poster that was out of place. That one was a poster of Rainbow Bright. &quot;Wait. I do have a question. What's with the Rainbow Bright poster? It just seems out of place in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My little sister loved Rainbow Bright&quot; Angelica said. &quot;I have this poster up to remind me of the good times we had. She used bug me to watch it with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Stephanie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was hit by a drunk driver two years ago&quot; Angelica said. &quot;She's been in a coma since then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Angelica said. &quot;The worst part is that I can't go see her. I can't take the chance that I'll ignite the oxygen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's rough&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;I can't imagine what you're going through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be driving you crazy&quot; I said. &quot;I know that it would drive me crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fortunately my mom calls me and I can at least talk to her&quot; Angelica said. &quot;We're hoping that she'll come out of it soon. If she does she'll be so surprised at my current state. The aliens transformed me the night my sister was hit so she's never seen me like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope that she does come out of her coma&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same goes for me&quot; Stephanie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Angelica said. &quot;Now it's about time for lunch. We can go down to the cafeteria now.&quot;<br />
<br />
We went down to the cafeteria and just made it to be toward the front of the line. They had a vast array of food that we could eat. I picked out a couple soft shell tacos, cherry jello, a chocolate chip cookie, a banana, and a grape juice. Stephanie basically had the same thing. Angelica seemed to be in a depressed mood since she got a lot of chocolate. As we ate I looked around and noticed that there were a wide variety of transformations here. There were those that had been shrunk down to doll size, grown to eleven foot tall,<br />
turned into anthros of every imaginable animal past and present, given extra limbs, skin turned different colors, of course changed gender, and other things. I even saw one girl that looked like a winged demon. Our transformations didn't seem so odd now.<br />
<br />
After lunch Angelica continued our tour. We saw an empty class room. It seemed small and Angelica said the classes are usually small to give the students a chance to learn. The auditorium was huge. It could easily seat thirty thousand people. The next stop was the nursery. It was big but not as big as I thought it would be. I thought about being pregnant. What would my child look like if the aliens did impregnate me? Would they be coming back for it like<br />
I've heard so many times before? Angelica explained that a few students helped out in the nursery. Finally we went to the school doctor. Angelica explained that it was equipped to handle just about anything.<br />
<br />
A Dr. Meyer saw me. She was in her early forties and really nice. She had me take off my clothes and examined me. I was relieved when she said that I was still a virgin but she wanted to do a pregnancy test anyway. I didn't think that it was necessary but I went along with it. After about a half hour Dr. Meyer told me the results.<br />
<br />
The pregnancy test was...</p>
