<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noelle went to her P.E. class after lunch.  She&#39;d actually forgotten she was a girl now until she got there, and saw Miss Conners helping Coach Ryder, who oversaw all the girl&#39;s sports teams.  Noelle felt very self-conscious as she entered the girl&#39;s locker room.  She tried not to look at any of the girls changing (yeah, she was curious, but it just didn&#39;t feel right- especially after some of the judgment calls she&#39;d made already today).  The weight of what the ring&#39;s power really meant had struck her- nobody should have power like this, and yet, she did.<br />
<br />
Should she really use it for such petty reasons?  Shouldn&#39;t she be thinking about using it to help people?  Something her dad used to say when he was alive came to her.  &#39;Just because you can do a thing doesn&#39;t mean you should.&#39;<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s locker room was laid out the same way as the boy&#39;s, but in reverse.  She was confused about which locker was hers, so regardless of her feelings, she was forced to use the ring, by wishing she knew which locker was hers quietly under her breath.  She idly wondered who would have used that locker back when she was a guy, but decided she didn&#39;t need to know that badly.<br />
<br />
She changed into her gym clothes quickly, then heard an argument break out on the other side of the locker room.  Curious, she looked over, and saw Cassidy about ready to murder Michelle Roth.  Michelle&#39;s family had a lot of money, and she was a very entitled girl who never quite learned how to check her privilege.  She was one of Ashley&#39;s rivals.  Rumor had it that Michelle had gotten plastic surgery- and she certainly seemed to have model-quality looks.  For the first time, Noelle was struck by how many attractive girls went to her school.<br />
<br />
Certainly, there were normal looking girls, but the percentage of pretty ones seemed unusually high.  She wasn&#39;t sure why that struck her as odd, but she couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that this was important for some reason.<br />
<br />
Anyways, apparently Michelle had seen Cassidy kissing Brianna, and had decided to make an issue of it.  &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have to dress in the same locker room as a lesbian!  It&#39;s disgusting!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now just yesterday, Cassidy would have been the perfect girl for Michelle to pick on.  But thanks to Ashley&#39;s influence and Noelle&#39;s wish, she was now the wrong girl to mess with.  &quot;Hey at least I can get a date without having to throw money around, unlike you!  I mean, would Greg care about a bitch like you if it wasn&#39;t for your boob job, and the fact that your dad is his dad&#39;s boss?  Then again, I guess I should pity you- I look twice as good as you without even trying!&quot;<br />
<br />
Which, to be fair, she did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, freak, you&#39;re nothing but poor trash anyways.  The only reason anyone talks to you is because Ashley took pity on you- and now that she&#39;s nothing, what does that make you?  And seriously, kissing Brianna?  Doesn&#39;t that make you a pedophile?  She&#39;s nothing but a spoiled brat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle winced as Cassidy slugged Michelle right in the jaw, sending the rich girl to the floor.  &quot;You shut your damn mouth, Michelle, or all your daddy&#39;s money won&#39;t be able to fix what I&#39;ll do to your face!&quot;<br />
<br />
About then, Coach Ryder blew her whistle.  &quot;Ok, break it up, break it up, what&#39;s going on here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This perverted bitch tried to rape me!  I want her expelled!  I&#39;m going to sue this school!&quot;  Michelle screamed from her position on the floor.<br />
<br />
Noelle realized she could probably make good on that threat.  &quot;I wish time would stop for everyone but me and Ashley.&quot;  And once again, the world was in greyscale.  Her phone rang a few seconds later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Ashley, I guess I should have warned you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noelle, what&#39;s going on?&quot;  Ashley sounded concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you were here.&quot;  And with a soft *bamf* noise, she was.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, that&#39;s freaky.  Holy shit, what is going on?&quot;  Ashley, Noelle noticed, had a bruise on her jaw that wasn&#39;t there before.<br />
<br />
Deciding to let that go for now, Noelle explained the situation.  &quot;I want to do something to keep Cassidy from being expelled, but I don&#39;t trust myself.  This ring...the things it can let me do...I&#39;m scared, Ash.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley hugged Noelle tight.  &quot;Hey, as long as you&#39;re worried, that means you&#39;re not out of control.  But let me tell you what I think.  The ring found you.  Out of everybody in the world, you were the one to find it.  So if anyone is meant to have this power, maybe you&#39;re the best choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should just wish...&quot;  Ashley reached up and put her fingers over Noelle&#39;s lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop right there.  Now, come over here.&quot;  She led Noelle closer to the bench that ran between the row of lockers.  She hopped up on the bench (not for the first time, Noelle was impressed by how nimble Ashley was) and, now that she was eye level, Ashley threw her arms around Noelle&#39;s neck and kissed her.<br />
<br />
And what a kiss!  If Noelle wore glasses, she&#39;d be sure that they would be fogged over.  &quot;Ashley...&quot;  She didn&#39;t know how to put what she was feeling into words, but they were strong emotions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, baby.  I feel the same way.  You look really good in gym clothes.&quot;  She smiled softly.  &quot;It&#39;s been a long day for you, so tell you what, let&#39;s fix this, then get out of here.  Take the rest of the day off.  It&#39;s about time we went on our first date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle nodded.  &quot;Ok.  What do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s my fault that Cassidy outed herself and Bri.  I don&#39;t want to try and put that genie back in the bottle, so now we&#39;re looking at damage control.  Does Michelle actually have any friends, or just people she&#39;s bought?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle blinked.  &quot;I hope that&#39;s a rhetorical question, because how the heck would I know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, baby.  You&#39;ve been on the outside for years.  You know whose fake and who isn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...I thought you were fake.&quot;  Noelle mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you were right.  Come on, I want your insight here.&quot;  It was kind of neat being eye level with Ashley, and she could tell that Ash really wanted to hear what Noelle had to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andy Carter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Andrea?  You&#39;re sure?&quot;  Ashley seemed surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s almost always nearby, and remember when someone spray painted &#39;RICH $LUT&#39; on Michelle&#39;s locker?  Andrea was the one comforting her when she lost her shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley looked very guilty.  &quot;I did that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured.  You and Michelle hate each other with the intensity of a thousand dying stars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting turn of phrase there, baby, but apt.  Still, I feel guilty about that now.  What do you see in a little bitch like me anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle leaned in to kiss Ashley, and she reciprocated eagerly.  &quot;I don&#39;t know, you&#39;re smart, charismatic, beautiful, feisty, unbelievably cute, and an amazing kisser.  Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right, I could do better.&quot;<br />
<br />
That earned Noelle a punch in the arm (it stung a bit- either Ashley was really strong, even at her current height, or Noelle wasn&#39;t as tough as a girl as she&#39;d been as Noah).  &quot;Jerk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, I&#39;m agreeing with you?&quot;  Noelle smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t agreed with me since the 5th grade, don&#39;t start now.  Now tell me how cute I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You made Brianna into the avatar of cuteness itself, and I think you&#39;re still cuter.  Especially when you smile.&quot;  That earned Noelle another soft smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you&#39;re forgiven.  Anyways, I guess you&#39;re right, Andrea wouldn&#39;t hang around with Michelle because of her money, her family is loaded too, she just doesn&#39;t make a big deal out of it.&quot;  It was true, Andrea&#39;s mom was an authoress who&#39;d written several New York Times best sellers.  &quot;Ok, so, would you say that Andrea loves Michelle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I don&#39;t know, maybe?  What are you suggesting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welll..if someone saw Michelle kissing Andrea, that&#39;d suck the wind out of her sails.&quot;  Ashley noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.  Yeah, but that feels a bit dirty.  Michelle probably deserves that, but does Andrea?&quot;  Noelle frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  Let me put it to you this way.  I&#39;d trade away being popular forever in a heartbeat as long as you said you loved me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle put her arms around Ashley.  &quot;Not much of a trade, you&#39;re not exactly all that popular now.&quot;  And then, before she could say anything, Noelle kissed her softly.  &quot;Not to mention, I do love you.  A lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley&#39;s eyes glistened with tears.  &quot;Noelle...that makes me so happy.&quot;  They kissed some more, there in that moment of frozen time in the girl&#39;s locker room.<br />
<br />
When they finally pulled apart, Noelle couldn&#39;t help but comment on that.  &quot;If you&#39;re happy, why are you crying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Idiot.  It&#39;s a girl thing.  Just wait until it happens to you.&quot;  She smiled, even as she sniffled cutely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s something we need to talk about, but ok.  So I&#39;ll wish that Andrea and Michelle love each other, and that, say, they kissed earlier today when they thought no one was watching.  And then I&#39;ll say I saw them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley gave Noelle an odd look, but then nodded.  &quot;Yeah.  It&#39;ll probably do them both a ton of good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, here goes.  I wish that Andrea and Michelle share a profound and deep love for each other, and that they have just started a relationship.  I wish that Andrea confessed her feelings to Michelle very recently, and that Michelle reciprocates these feelings.  I wish that Andrea and Michelle were kissing earlier today by the old south lockers when they thought no one was around- and it was one hell of a makeout session.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, steamy.  Now I want pictures.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Be good, Ash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle laughed.  &quot;Ok, I wish Ashley was invisible to everyone but me.  I wish that no one will notice that Ashley has left her classroom, and that all of her things are back in her locker.&quot;  As Noelle made the wish, suddenly Ashley was completely naked.  &quot;Oh shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley looked down at herself and laughed.  &quot;Dummy!  Well, it&#39;s a good thing only you can see me, huh?&quot;  Her nipples hardened in the cool air of the locker room.  &quot;I&#39;m going to stand by the vent, its chilly in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could wish your clothes back on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing doing.  This has been a fantasy of mine for a long time, being able to walk around naked if I wanted to.  And I want to, especially if my girlfriend can see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle felt giddy again, but just nodded.  &quot;Ok, I wish time would start again!&quot;<br />
<br />
As time began to move, Noelle saw a very strange look come over Michelle&#39;s face.  Then she blushed- a mixture of arousal and shame, if Noelle had to guess.  At this point Noelle spoke up, just before the Coach could separate everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Michelle, that would kind of make you a hypocrite, since I saw you and Andy making out earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could hear a pin drop.  All the girls turned to look at Noelle, and Michelle looked like she wished she would shrink away to nothing (which gave Noelle some ideas, but she ignored that for now).  Then the girls turned to look at Michelle (having decided Noelle was a trusted source of unbiased information).<br />
<br />
Michelle got up, looked around, and fled the room, running right past Coach Ryder, tears in her eyes.  Noelle saw Miss Conners pull Michelle into a hug and get her out of there.  Noelle couldn&#39;t have planned that better if she tried...<br />
<br />
Coach Ryder was still looking to send Cassidy to the principal&#39;s office, but before she could, the metalhead girl leaned in to whisper to Noelle.  &quot;You&#39;re alright, Bishop.  I owe you one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle just gave her a thumbs up.  Then she was forced to tell the tale of Andy and Michelle a couple of times.  It wasn&#39;t easy, since Ash seemed bound and determined to use her newfound invisibility to distract the hell out of Noelle, so finally.  &quot;I wish Ashley and I were on a warm, sunny beach with clear skies and clean blue water, where no one can bother us, and that nobody will notice we left school early.&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that, Noelle was momentarily blinded by bright sunlight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!  It&#39;s so warm!&quot;  Ashley was looking around at the majestic white sand beach they found themselves on.  A few palm trees provided shade, and the water was very inviting.  &quot;Let&#39;s go for a swim!&quot;  Naked as a newborn, she plunged into the cool water.<br />
<br />
Noelle laughed, and got undressed as well, joining her.  They frolicked and played in the water for some time, until they found themselves in each other&#39;s arms.  Noelle lifted her tiny girlfriend up and took her to the beach, where a blanket, towels, a beach umbrella, and a picnic basket soon appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noelle.  I want to have sex with you, right here.&quot;  Ashley smiled at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want that too, but there&#39;s something I have to say first.&quot;  Noelle set her down, and then sat next to her on the blanket, wrapping a towel around the tiny girl.  &quot;I do love you.  I mean that.  But I feel like those feelings have only come out because I&#39;m a girl now.  I know that&#39;s strange, but I feel about you so much stronger now.  I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d feel if I went back to being a guy, and I don&#39;t really want to, because you make me really happy.  But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fair to you- you told me that while you&#39;d fooled around with girls, you&#39;re not a lesbian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Serious talking.  Listen, baby.  I love you.  I do.  With all my heart.  Male, female- if you said you wanted to be a centaur, I&#39;d think it was weird, but I&#39;d be ok with it.&quot;  A centaur?  That was random.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but being ok with it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s what you want.&quot;  Noelle pressed the issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you!  That&#39;s all I want!  You.  Nothing else matters!&quot;  She was crying again.<br />
<br />
Noelle pulled the girl into her arms and kissed her wet hair.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t like making you cry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It goes with the territory...you&#39;re a girl now, and our emotions are complicated sometimes.  But look, I&#39;ve been noticing changes as well.  Like, girls are more attractive to me now.  I&#39;m ready to admit I&#39;m probably bi, I just never had strong feelings about a girl before.  So no, this isn&#39;t a problem.  At all.  I&#39;m happy to have you as a girlfriend.  If you decide you want to be a boy again, I&#39;ll be happy to have you as a boyfriend.  Though, if I&#39;m being honest...I think you&#39;re hotter as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle blinked.  &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were cute before, baby, but now, yeah, you make me feel weak in the knees.  I want you bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then, you have me.  But uh, I should warn you, I&#39;ve never had sex with a girl before, so you might have to take the lead here.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggled.  &quot;I kind of figured.  It&#39;s ok.  I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re a natural.  But uh, I want you to do one thing first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shrink me more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Noelle couldn&#39;t believe her ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we&#39;ve established you got a thing for short girls.  Plus, well, it turns me on, being smaller than you.  I never knew this was a kink for me, but it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.  Then how small...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck, I don&#39;t know...what would be weird for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle thought about that.  &quot;I honestly have no idea.  I wish you were 3 feet tall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley&#39;s eyes widened as she began to dwindle in Noelle&#39;s arms.  She quickly became toddler-sized, and Noelle held the diminutive girl in his lap.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, I&#39;m practically a baby!&quot;  Her voice had become higher pitched, and her features seemed somehow more delicate and flawless.  She looked up at Noelle.  &quot;Your tits are huge now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle laughed and lay back on the blanket.  Ashley scrambled up to straddle Noelle, perched just below her breasts.  With a grin, she began to caress them with her tiny hands.  &quot;This is going to be interesting.  Challenge accepted!&quot;<br />
<br />
They stayed on beach all night, and Noelle wished for a fire to keep them warm.  It was a good night.<br />
<br />
Next time!</p>
