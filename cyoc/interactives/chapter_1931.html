<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan walked into a dark room and felt his way around, everything seemed to be covered in a thick layer of dust, and cobb webbs were everywhere, he could barly make out the room. But he knew it was a bedroom because every time the lightning struck it illuminated the room around him, it was done in the old victorian style, with a big four poster bed in the center of the large room. Ryan saw a dresser with a candelabra on it, it had four old used candels still in it. So headed over to it to light it and go find the rest of the group. Ryan got to the candelabra and got out his lighter and lit the used candels. The smell of burnt cobwebs filled the air, and the room lit up with a dim but visable light.
<br />

<br />
 Ryan was looking around the cobweb covered room when he heard his younger brother Johnny moaning loudly as if he were in some great pain. Ryan quickly started to head for the door to go and help his, to him nuinance little brother, he was always getting into trouble and it seemed like Ryan was constantly either defending him from would be bullys or hepling him with something he couldnt do himself. It was his job as the bigger older brother to do it, and he took his role a little to seriously at times. Johnny sort of resented his big brother when he did it. 
<br />

<br />
 Ryan felt a weird tingle going through his body as he got closer to the big old style door, it was the tall kind that old houses all had, it loomed almost eight feet high. Ryan thought it dawrfed him when he first opened it, but now that it was lit by the dim candels lights it seemed to be even taller. Ryan felt the tingling in his body getting stronger and stronger with every step he took, then he felt the distict feeling of vertigo, as if he was falling, everything in the room was growing including the four walls and the big bed next to him. Ryan stoped and reached down with his musculare arm and put his hand down on the dusty bed coverings to steady himself.
<br />

<br />
 He felt strangly weak for some reason, the candelabra seemed to be getting heavyer as he stood there. He felt like he was burning up and sweat was pouring from his underarms,he felt he had to get his tee shirt off. Ryan put the candelabra down on the night table and took off his tee shirt, he turned round and saw his own reflection in a large mirror and was startled by it, he thought someone else was in the room with him, it did'nt look like him, the guy in the reflection was smaller and, less musculare then he was, but it was him it moved when he did. something was defently wrong with him.
<br />

<br />
 Soon it felt like every bit of his body hair was tingling including his pupic hair, it all itched like crazy and he reached down and stuck his hand into his jeans to scratch his ball hairs, as he did it he felt that the waist line of his once tight fitting jeans seemed to be roomyer, and they looked loose on him, he could easly scratch his balls without to much presure given to his hand by the waist line of his jeans. He pulled his hand out of his pants and rubbed his face he felt his tingling mustash and goatee and scratched them, the hair seemed to be softer and less dense, and his goatee felt more like peach fuzz then the coarse thick hairs of a beard. Ryan could feel his jeans riding down his thighs and he reached down to pull them back up, he knew something was deffenetly happening to him now and he ran towards the mirror to get a closer look at himself, his shoes threatened to come off his feet as he went, he had to hold up the jeans so wouldnt fall. He was freaking out bad the whole room seemed to be growing all around him. Ryan was just about to the mirror when the lights to the house came on, it starteled Ryan at first then he figured that Eric, who had gone down the basement stairs must have thrown the breaker switch to the houses lights and the power must have still been on. Ryan had let go of his jeans the minute the lights had come on, and they slid down his thighs with ease, they were barly hanging around his thighs. Ryan could see himself clearly now in the mirror and just staired in shock at what he saw. 
<br />

<br />
  He was defently shorter, his jeans looked two or three sizes to big for his body, which now looked less muscular and younger as well, his mustash was barly peach fuzz and his once powerful thick pecs were smaller looking and devoid of the thick coat of hair they once had. Ryan watched as the last remaining bit of his chests hairs pulled into his thinning chest and disapeared, he then saw his remaining muscles start to get smaller and smaller as he seemed to go back in time physically, his now hairless face showed his astonishment as his mouth droped open and his now hugh jeans slid down his thinner legs carrying his once tight breifs with them. Ryan watched in awe as the pupic hair dissapeared from his groin, he grabbed at his still large penis and held it tightly, and watched in horror as his sizeable manly cock shrank down in size. he screamed and his voice cracked to prepubesent tone. as it went farther down in size to that of a 8 year olds! &quot;NOOOO!! GOD WHATS HAPPENING TO ME&quot; the now kid sized Ryan said in a childs panicy voice. 
<br />

<br />
 Ryan felt everything stop and he just stood there frozen in fear and shock he now had the body of an eight year olds, and it was a weak one at that. He pulled his jeans up and they came up past his now small nipples and the legs were still folded in a layers above shoes that were way to big for him now. Ryan eyes started to tear up as he tryed desperatly to walk in his now incombering clothes, he stepped out of his over sized shoes and his socks came off his now frail tiny feet, he let go of his jeans and stepped back wards and triped in the waist line of his jeans and fell flat on his now frail skinny little kids ass. He put his hands to his face and cryed. He realized he would be the one to need the help of someone bigger and older now!</p>
