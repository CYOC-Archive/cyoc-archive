<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The kiss took me by surprise, long-nailed fingers clasping my head, dragging through my short hair as Lartara pulled my lips to hers. She didn&#39;t have to do this, but after hearing how she&#39;d been turned I knew that she couldn&#39;t conscience any other way. She&#39;d shared her vulnerability with me, and I couldn&#39;t help but be drawn in, savoring the first friendly touch I&#39;d had in a long time. I returned the kiss, hungrily, desperately, my lips parting, my tongue brushing against those dangerous shapes in her mouth. Almost human, but always reminding of the predator that lurked within her, and soon would in me. I was tired of the isolation. I was tired of not being allowed to feel, and having someone here I could start to trust was pushing a flood through the walls of my resistance.<br />
<br />
Coming up for air after the kiss, my fumbling hands grasped for the hem of my top. The damned cotton scrubs that had marked me as less than them. I never wanted to wear them again, yanking my top up over my head, exposing my freckled chest, rosy nipples standing at attention, capping my petite breasts. I looked to Lartara with a panting, nervous laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s the fire?&quot; she chuckled, gold seeping into her eyes as she licked lengthening fangs. &quot;Oh I know,&quot; she smirked as she ran her fingers through my rust-colored hair, &quot;here...&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused, running a finger along my collarbone, then slowly down between my breasts, further down to my navel, and finally clasping her hand between my legs, pressing cotton against my secret. I felt my netherlips quiver, and I bit my lower lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you like... fire, do you?&quot; I asked experimentally, reaching out to rub the shaven side of her head, running my thumb along the edge of an ear that was twitching, stretching to an elfin point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to like showing you yours. I&#39;ve seen it in you for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... then show me. I&#39;m tired of feeling weak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t. Not ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
She got up from the bed, kneeling down in front of me. Hastily I hooked my fingers into the waistband of my scrub pants, shimmying them down. They had us shave regularly. Hygiene reasons they said, but after seeing the barracks I could tell it was just another way they separated us from them. Lartara licked darkening lips as she watched me reveal my shaven mound, lowering the scrubs down my thighs, past my knees, and finally kicking them aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every one of those girls out there knew nothing but bliss when they became,&quot; she said, moving in closer. &quot;My barracks, my rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; I replied with determination.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I knew that,&quot; she said with a sly, toothy grin as she traced a nail that was already a talon along my cleft. &quot;The nose knows.&quot;<br />
<br />
My cheeks flushed as I let out a stuttering moan. I was already an open book to her, as embarrassing as that was. I was almost past caring. I clasped my hands on her head, running my fingers through the wild warrior&#39;s crest that hung down her back. She gave an approving snarl before leaning in betwixt my legs, snuffling with a nose that was broadening, flattening and darkening. An altogether animal gesture that somehow just felt right to me, sending a tremor of pleasure up my spine. Clutching at her head I guided her towards me, rewarded with a sudden thrill as I felt her eager tongue part my cleft.<br />
<br />
Fire. It really did feel like fire rising in me as her mouth started to explore me, her fangs grazing dangerously along my netherlips, teasing my hooded pearl as the contagion entered my most intimate region. I could feel my pulse in my secret as it started to change. Pale-pink folds quivering, darkening as they puffed outwards, the first mark of my fading humanity. The musk I had smelled from all of them rose anew, this time coming fresh from between my legs. Lartara seemed to take it as encouragement, redoubling her efforts as fiery hair blossomed from my mound. I sucked in a breath, my ribs lifting higher than before, and let out a husky moan I could scarcely believe was my own voice, devolving into a bestial snarl at the end.<br />
<br />
My limbs tensed, my joints cracking and popping as my bones lurched within me, my back broadening, my legs pushing out in front of me inch by inch, muscles writhing in my thighs, my calves. Holding Lartara&#39;s scalp in a death-grip as tendons rose on my hands, my forearms, strength flowing into my biceps. My nipples darkened, buoyed forward by the swelling shelf of my breasts. I was in Valhalla, and here I was, snarling, lurching into a valkyrie like them. My hair grew out in sheaves, an unruly tangle of fire that first brushed my shoulders, then tumbled down my back and pooled atop my newfound jutting glories. I was already an amazon, easily Lartara&#39;s equal, but the only thing I could think of is that I didn&#39;t want it to stop. I had visions of running with her, naked and free, of feeling the wind in... in my pelt.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-more,&quot; I stammered through sharpening teeth. &quot;Show me morrrrrh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll show you everything,&quot; she breathed into my secret before clasping my pearl between her fangs.<br />
<br />
Her expert tongue explored my inhuman sex with abandon, and I felt myself wracked with the change again, each tremor of pleasure wrenching my frame upwards, outwards, thick hackles spreading across my hunched back, rusty tufts pushing forth from my lifting cheekbones. I was growing past valkyrie into one of the great beasts of this world, and it felt like the most natural thing I could imagine. Fur raced down my spine, pushing forth into a thrashing lupine tail. The arches of my feet stretched, my toes swelling into paws and pushing forth claws. Hair sprouted on my knuckles amidst Lartara&#39;s dark hair and riffled up the back of my hands, spreading upward, coating steely muscle with shaggy pelt.<br />
<br />
I felt my pleasure building between my legs as Lartara began to hit home with her tongue, sending spasms through me that pulled my shaggy giantess frame rigid, my back arching as my pelt blossomed across me, sprawling between my breasts as a triumphant, fiery ruff of fur. I sucked in breath as the fur crowded up around my darkening nose, my jaws stretching, pushing forth. As the last orgasm rushed through me I let that breath out as a victorious howl. In the barracks beyond, a chorus of whoops answered me.<br />
<br />
My sisters.<br />
<br />
Panting, I looked down at Lartara, my wild mane framing my muzzle, thick locks of red hanging over me like a mantle, a single streak of pure silver draped over a golden eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; She called out, loud enough that she must have intended the other warriors to hear.<br />
<br />
I paused for a moment, my head still clearing from the throes of pleasure. It was then I realized... I knew a new name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harkaal!&quot; I cried out through my changed mouth.<br />
<br />
Another cheer from the barracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; I whispered to Lartara, focusing my gaze on hers, &quot;...I&#39;m Haley, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll talk about that later,&quot; she whispered with a soft smile. &quot;I&#39;ll introduce you to the others on the next shift change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But for now,&quot; she said, raising her voice again, &quot;these girls want to meet their new sister!&quot;</p>
