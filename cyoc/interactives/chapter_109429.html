<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha&#39;s late morning went on quietly and with some enjoyment going through her mind. That came mostly from the call to get her first day as a substitute teacher. The fears of exposure were still there in the back of her mind, but Martha did feel far more comfortable than she had the day before thanks to Frances&#39; and Samantha&#39;s help in assuring her that things would be fine and her own son&#39;s confidence that things would be fine. That gave her confidence to move forward and enjoy the pluses of being a were and being at Moon Lake, and she had plenty of those to count.<br />
<br />
The big thing was moving into a more independent career type role. In Minnesota before her marriage to William and before giving birth to Nate and Eric, she&#39;d been an elementary school teacher, and while she did give that up to be there for Nate and Eric full time, especially while William&#39;s salary at the University of Minnesota was high enough to cover the Anderson family comfortably, it did leave her missing seeing young kids learn and grow. Now, however, with Nate and Eric growing up, Martha was ready to move back into the workforce. William had proposed the idea of returning to teaching and she went along with it. She was studying to earn her certification for Washington State and meeting the qualifications for Moon lake specifically and felt confident that she&#39;d be able to pass and ultimately resume her career as an elementary school teacher. Dawn had even told her at the in-service the previous Friday that she&#39;d be a shoe in for the position that would open up come the end of the present school year. She felt optimistic about that.<br />
<br />
Until she got her certification and the present school year ended, she could only do some substitute teaching and fill in for a teacher or an aide that was out for various reasons. That could be somewhat difficult, as most of the staff at Moon Lake Elementary School were weres. There were only one or two Normals that she remembered seeing at the in-service, and Martha figured that went for the entire school district as it did the town. This meant that it wasn&#39;t as likely for her to get a lot of calls due to sickness, as weres were immune to most diseases, including some of the most virulent, though thankfully she would still get paid for being available. However, that didn&#39;t mean that Martha simply wanted to be at home and get paid for doing nothing. The fact that the school had called and a mission for her made her feel fairly happy at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get to teach,&quot; Martha thought happily to herself as she sat in the living room as she continued to think over the call and the assignment she&#39;d gotten, &quot;Well... help teach.&quot;<br />
<br />
The call had been for her to fill in for the assistant gym coach at the Junior High, which would handle boys and girls PE at the Junior High. Martha wouldn&#39;t be responsible or required to fill in for any extra curricular sports teams that Moon Lake had, though her studying had so far found that to be pretty difficult to pinpoint. The Middle School and High School had all the traditional sports teams that you&#39;d find in a school setting, however, to prevent Moon Lake&#39;s secret being exposed when a bunch of weres with strength, speed, and stamina advantages over normals dominate teams made up of normal humans, most of these teams weren&#39;t in any league that would compete outside of Moon Lake. The Moon Lake football team had two squads that played a head to head match-up on Thanksgiving, which varied depending on the year. Some years it was &quot;predators vs. prey,&quot; other years it was &quot;upperclassmen vs underclassmen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only sports where Moon Lake did compete with the other schools in Washington State were all non-contact sports and the natural advantages weres had physically either weren&#39;t as much of an advantage as one would think or in the sport were limited by physiology. Any and all weres could run faster than humans, but in track and field events, that didn&#39;t mean they could run as fast as they could in their were forms. In their human forms they were still limited by human anatomy and the longer digitigrade legs of their were forms that helped them achieve even greater speeds wouldn&#39;t be possible. This meant that a human athlete who trained hard could potentially win a footrace with a were in human form or even in other track and field events. Sports like tennis and dance fit into similar categories as far Martha had found in her research.<br />
<br />
However, she would likely only be helping with the PE class and wouldn&#39;t that many of the extra activities that went with it. It wasn&#39;t at the elementary school, but Martha figured she&#39;d manage. As she thought over the fact that she&#39;d have a day to work and continue to  put down personal contacts in Moon Lake beyond the people she&#39;d already met, another thought came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would I wear?&quot; Martha realized as she sat up on the couch.<br />
<br />
Since she taught at the elementary school level in the past, she hadn&#39;t been in need for gym clothes and neither had she ever been something of a fitness nut. She may have occasionally taken walks, but she&#39;d found that some common clothes had been good enough for that. She wasn&#39;t sure that she had anything for a gym class. With that she got up and made her way up to the bedroom she shared with William. She had to check their shared closet and her own chest of drawers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll need something that I can move in and move in easily and athletically in case I need to run after someone or as part of the class activity,&quot; Martha thought to herself as she walked up the stairs, &quot;I think I have a couple of woman&#39;s polo shirts that could work and look professional... that could work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first place she checked was the closet and she walked into it and looked to the rung that held her clothing. She quickly began sliding hangers along to sort through things until she found the sets of woman&#39;s polo shirts. She eventually figured one that was a purple shirt with a gold head of a unicorn on its upper right shoulder. She wasn&#39;t fully sure on Moon Lake&#39;s school colors, but she figured that shirt would do.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will do,&quot; Martha mused to herself, &quot;though, I&#39;ll need to look into getting a few more... Awareness might be too expensive for this, particularly as I still need to get William there to go their men&#39;s section for clothes that he could shift and transform in. That would mean that they&#39;d probably end up having some hefty charges for William&#39;s clothing as well... But then that K-Mart should be fine. I&#39;m sure they will have plenty of woman&#39;s polo shirts I could add... just in case I get more sub days like what I&#39;ll have this work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Assured of that, Martha began to look for what she could wear for pants. Dress pants probably wouldn&#39;t work as they wouldn&#39;t be something she could easily move in but sweat pants would be too informal and thus not professional. She ultimately figured a pair of jeans would be good enough to wear, but she had to make sure they were relaxed fit or at least as relaxed as she could manage. Martha knew that on her new hips, butt, and toned legs, old relaxed fit jeans might fit the new her like jeans that were to fit tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may need to go the K-Mart today and get some jeans that will fit the new me,&quot; Martha thought to herself as she looked back over her shoulder toward her rear and her hips, &quot;as a lot of what I have... while it still fits... it wouldn&#39;t be entirely professional.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Martha then made her way out the closet and turned to her chest of drawers. She privately figured a pair of wind-breaker pants might work well for the gym class assignment if she could find a pair that would pass for professional in a gym class setting, but moved on to her next main task which related to being ready. She needed underwear that allow her to move and be comfortable. She had a few pairs of cotton panties that she&#39;d had from before moving to Moon Lake. They, like the rest of her old clothing, still fit though a bit more snugly than they used to, but she figured they&#39;d do. She thought she&#39;d also gotten a pair of panties at Awareness that would be simple and comfortable enough that she be &quot;athletic&quot; in them, but she&#39;d need to double check that to make sure they were clean. <br />
<br />
The other thing that she felt she&#39;d need would be a sports bra. If she had to run anywhere, her normal bras would allow for too much of a bounce in her bosom for a school situation. She was sure that the bounce of her E cup breasts could get a very firm rise out of William or the Twists, but if she was working, she wasn&#39;t supposed to be seducing anyone one and if a gym situation, she might have to move around more than she did when teaching at an elementary school. She we need a sports bra that would fit her and keep her breasts from bouncing around too much.  She checked her bra draw and then sighed. It contained no sports bras.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose I have some errands to run and some walking to do,&quot; Martha gave a sigh and then felt her stomach rumble, &quot;but I&#39;ll deal with THAT after lunch.&quot;</p>
