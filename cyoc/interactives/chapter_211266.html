<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric ran a thumb across the magic ring. It was made of metal, probably silver and the band was carved into the shape of a platypus biting into the tail of what seems to be a half-monkey half-fish hybrid; it was definitely a weird looking ring, Eric had never seen another like it, but nothing about the ring would seem conspicuous to those who were unaware of the incredible power it holds.<br />
<br />
Eric placed a free hand atop his groin and squeezed gently, calling back to the events that led to him ending up with his older brother’s dick. He shakes his head ‘No, it’s my dick now’.<br />
<br />
Happily releasing the member from the confines of his shorts, it sprang out and bobbed up and down as if sharing the same sentiment. Eric smiled as his hand slowly stroked up and down the length of the ever expanding cock, getting harder and bigger with every pulse. Eric put the ring on top of his study desk, so he could use both hands because one wasn’t enough. The sensations brought him to a heightened ecstasy, he marveled at the mauve-ish cockhead that exposed itself now and then, as the foreskin rolled with the movements of his hands.<br />
<br />
Eric’s toes curled and his feet lifted off from the floor, feeling the marching band of semen very slowly making their way out the massive flesh tunnel. It had always taken him a long while to feel that pressure to cum, now with this thick 14 inch cock, it felt like it would take much longer for his wad to reach the tip. The truth was that no matter how many times Eric had jerked off, he couldn’t seem to shoot, not even back when he had his original miniscule penis. The night he and Ethan jerked off in front of each other was also the first time he had ever shot a load and Eric missed that feeling greatly.<br />
<br />
A light bulb went off in Eric’s mind, maybe thinking of that night would speed things up and he’ll be able to shoot again? He went back to the time Ethan measured the monster, flabbergasted and lying on the floor, his brother’s eyes obviously begging for a taste. He then decided to play out the memory a little differently.<br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for?” grunted Eric “suck it”.<br />
<br />
This time his brother had not refused, this time Ethan opened his drooling mouth as wide as he could, the teenager kept his gaze locked onto Eric’s as the enormous schlong disappeared into a hungry hole, betwixt soft lips. Eric spat onto his dick and continued rubbing it with both hands, trying to emulate what he’d imagine the inside of someone’s mouth would feel like; in attempts to aid the fantasy.<br />
<br />
He thought up a world where it had always been this way, where his perfect older brother was great in everything but one small area, a place that Eric triumphed over. As Ethan’s ‘trained’ throat swallowed inch after inch of the monster, Eric began teasing him.<br />
<br />
“You like this don’t you? You wish you had a cock this big” Eric moaned and groaned “Jealous, wondering why me? How can my little bro be… be the bigger brother?”<br />
<br />
Both hands shot up to twist around the top 4 inches, the boy shut his eyes tight trying to make the vision of his new fantasy world more vivid.<br />
<br />
“Ethan, there’s only one way you can make it yours” he exclaimed aloud “that’s right, take as much as you can” Eric bucked his hips and in his mind his brother is gagging from the sheer force “Oh Ethan, Ethan, Ethan!”<br />
<br />
“What’s up?” Ethan asked as he walked into the room, carrying a laundry basket. He froze in place as he watched his little brother frantically shove a bloated penis back inside stretched out shorts, it refused to be contained and kept pulling itself out or poking through the leg holes “I…uh thought I heard you call my name?” Ethan said, looking away when he realized he’d been staring, trying to move on from the awkwardness by collecting articles of clothing from the floor.<br />
<br />
“Well, anyway, we better shower now or we’re going to be late for school um…” The teenaged boy looked at the time on his phone, in spite of what he just said the boys had plenty of time “Just… finish your business in the shower, come on”.<br />
<br />
Both brothers made their way to the bathroom with flared up faces, Ethan pulled his clothes off and threw them straight into the laundry basket. He catches Eric looking his way. Money had been a little tight since he splurged a bit for Christmas so they agreed to shower together again to lift the burden off their water bill. Sustained erections from both parties should be normal by now but it was starting to dawn on them that not saying anything might not be the best course of action.<br />
<br />
“So back there… in your room” Ethan started.<br />
“I can’t cum” Eric blurted out.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I cum, I think but nothing is coming out” the little boy took a breath before continuing “That time when we…we did it together was the first time… it was the only time it… came out” his eyes fell to the floor, though it couldn’t really since his raging hard on obscured most of the view.<br />
<br />
“But you’ve been jerking off almost every night, don’t you come like really fast?” said Ethan which made Eric’s eyes shoot right up, “I… the walls are pretty paper thin… just saying”.<br />
<br />
“Well… nothing comes out, there’s something wrong with me…”<br />
<br />
With that the older brother walked forward, kneeled and placed both hands on his little brother’s shoulders “Don’t ever say that again, everyone is different okay? Hermanito, there’s nothing wrong with you I…” Ethan swallowed for a moment “I can’t actually get hard with my old dick anymore” Eric looked at Ethan a bit puzzled which prompted the teenager to confess further “The night we switched back, I tried, but I couldn’t…I couldn’t get hard”.<br />
<br />
“You’re just trying to make me feel better”<br />
<br />
“No seriously, that’s why I… I don’t mind being like this…” Ethan looked down at his rock hard micro cock peeking through folds of skin, a pointy foreskin still covering the head.<br />
<br />
“I don’t believe you”<br />
<br />
“Get the ring, it should be in my toolbox, I’ll prove it to you”<br />
<br />
Eric took heed and left the bathroom, making his way to his room since Ethan didn’t know he had nicked it. He came back and gave his brother the ring.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn’t hesitate to pull his little brothers shorts down and put his arm through it while putting on the magical accessory; Eric’s dick gleefully swung around in the air, he could feel the rush once more, he was always just so close it frustrated him.<br />
<br />
Ethan got up, towering over the boy “Just watch” He wished real hard and soon a familiar warmth came over the boys, the static sensation followed with the shrinking and growing of each male’s appendages.<br />
<br />
Eric maintained a hard rock solid state throughout the transformation whilst Ethan ironically got softer as his penis grew bigger.<br />
<br />
“See?” The teenager smiled, slapping the flaccid monster dick around “It’s useless on me” He hammered down his point by stroking the meat vigorously but no cigar, it stayed softer than a hush puppy.<br />
<br />
The younger boy started imitating the motion on himself and after a good few minutes gave up as well. Ethan scratched his head, this can’t be right? Wasn’t the smaller penis (though it looked bigger on Eric) more sensitive? The countless times he had come from it without even touching himself was astronomical at this point.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you usually come fast?” Ethan asked not really thinking before he did.<br />
<br />
Eric huffed at his brother “I told you, that time we did it together was the first time, if anything I take a loooooooong time” he crossed his arms annoyed.<br />
<br />
‘Was… was premature ejaculation actually my thing?’ Ethan thought to himself and not long after the words ran through he could hear an inner voice laughing.<br />
<br />
‘That’s right’ it said ‘The only reason you never noticed is cause your dick WAS so long it took a while to leak out, but you’ve been a minute man since the beginning, a second man, barely a man’ the voice kept on and on ‘Little baby dick Ethan, so sensitive, so useless, so… pathetic’. The older boy felt a stirring in his testicles and they retreated slightly into his body, had he come just now? A tingle ran all over his body from his toes to this fingertips, but if he had come then the voice was right, nothing came out, his semen was probably halfway the flaccid flesh tube.<br />
<br />
“I don’t understand” said Eric, looking back and forth between the two penises “I can barely feel anything with this, why do keep shooting so easily with it?”<br />
<br />
Ethan’s ears turned red “I dunno… guess having a tiny penis is… my fetish or something…”<br />
<br />
“What’s a fetish?”<br />
<br />
“Um…like…something you need…to get off?”<br />
<br />
“So what’s my fetish?”<br />
<br />
“What? Dude I dunno”<br />
<br />
“I really wanna cum but I can’t”<br />
<br />
“Except for that one time…”<br />
<br />
“That time we…”<br />
<br />
There was a short silence as Ethan scanned his younger brother up and down. Suddenly the warmth came, the static, the change.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s floppy schlong retracted and as soon as it shrunk to about 3 inches it started to throb. It kept filling up with blood while still shrinking even further. It was an odd sensation to pair with the sight, it felt like it was getting bigger, but the penis was definitely doing the opposite. On the other side Eric’s giant came back with a vengeance, with every throb, came another inch. The bulbous cock head popping out of its foreskin, the skin bunched up behind it and stretched tighter as the monster regained its full hard erected mass.<br />
<br />
Ethan whistled “That’s impressive alright, let’s… figure out what helped, go on”.<br />
<br />
Both boys started stroking their cocks. The teenager had used most of his palm to cup his heavy balls while a thumb circled around his tiny exposed acorn dick head, Ethan only needed a thumb and it was enough to make his toes curl, nipples tingle and mouth water. The little boy had one hand pull the shaft skin up and down and with the other hand he rubbed the crown of his cock, slightly sticky from a thin layer of smegma.<br />
<br />
Ethan was already spilling his seed on the bathroom floor when Eric felt the rush again, so much closer to the tip of his cock. It was exciting, having someone there watching him playing with his gargantuan dick, and it wasn’t just anyone, it was his older brother, perfect charming brother. The tall masculine man, now with hair practically all over his body and who now has a penis so goddamn tiny it’s pathetic. It felt so good to have this over him, amazing in fact.<br />
<br />
“To think that used to be on me” Ethan murmured, his hand glazed with semen.<br />
<br />
“It was never on you” Eric blurted out but recovered “I mean… it got bigger, you never had a hard on with it” he added quickly.<br />
<br />
‘And you never will’ the older boy’s thoughts echoed.<br />
<br />
“Let me try something” Eric said, walking toward the bathroom mirror and pulling it off the hook on the wall. He leaned it against the sink “Could you kneel down in front of the mirror? But in a way so you could see yourself sideways?”<br />
“Why?” Ethan inquired.<br />
<br />
“Just do it” Eric demanded grabbing his brother’s hand and pulling him down, the older brother complied with little protest, something about being commanded satisfied an itch he didn’t know he had.<br />
<br />
Once the teen was in position, the little boy shoved his extra large penis between the teen’s legs.<br />
<br />
“Hey what do you think you’re doing?!” Ethan almost shrieked, Eric grinning ear to ear just told his brother to look.<br />
<br />
In the mirror Ethan saw something close to the man he used to be, but now with his tiny junk pushed to the side, he had a 14 inch long sausage that was also 9.5 inches wide. While still unbelievable, it did look more natural on his body than on Eric, but like that time he admired himself in his bedroom mirror, Ethan could not see the figure as “him”. The person in the mirror was someone else- the epitome of a real man, the Adonis; Ethan involuntarily shot another load.<br />
<br />
Eric bucked his hips further in, he could feel his brother’s body heat rising, part of his dick was rubbing against his brother’s asshole and that thought brought Eric so close to the edge, he didn’t even think about what he was doing when he started to sway his hips back and forth.<br />
<br />
“W…what are you doing?!” Ethan asked wide eyed. The younger boy pleaded that he was so close to coming, he pleaded to continue and before Ethan could say anymore Eric had pushed his brother down, except with him being so tall, the teenager bumped his head against the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
Ethan shut his eyes tight then exhaled “Fine, if this helps”<br />
<br />
Eric continued bucking his hips back and forth, feeling his brother’s sweaty asshole, hot thighs, balls and abs rub against the length of his huge dick; and there it was- ecstasy, as the young boy shot load after load between his older brother’s legs, he began to shake and his knees buckled over, finally resting against and drooling down Ethan’s back after completion.<br />
<br />
Ethan opened his eyes, he carefully shuffled Eric off. The teenager sat on the floor and looked around the tiny bathroom, it felt humid, the mirror foggy and his little brother panting while the last bits of cum dribbled out of the big cock’s tip.<br />
<br />
Ethan got up and turned on the shower “Come on, we’ll be late for school”.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are...are you mad?&quot; Eric asked, eyes half open.<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot;</p>
