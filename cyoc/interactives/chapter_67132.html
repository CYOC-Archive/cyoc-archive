<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David walked down the quiet hallway. The windowless doors displayed only single digit numbers as he walked past. No sounds came from them and he could not see any light from underneath them either. He continued walking the sound of his steps echoed deeply as he continued further. David came to the end of the hallway that split into another hallway and a staircase going down, marked with the word &quot;Gymnasium&quot; and an arrow pointing down. David never heard of a basement gym before. He looked down the empty hallway and realized what he noticed was missing. There were no lockers anywhere. <br />
<br />
David was trying to make sense of all this in his head when he started to hear voices coming from the stairs. It sounded like a girl yelling something that he couldn't quite make out. David decided to descend down the stairs and see what was going on. <br />
<br />
The voice started to become clearer. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right, get them all gathered over there! Remember, if we can pull this off we all may get rewarded.&quot;<br />
<br />
David came to a large room. It appeared to be like any other high school gym, with basketball hoops, bleachers and the like. However there were several oddities David took notice of. First there was balcony several feet up in the air and next to it was a large glass window that looked like it was meant for some kind of observation room. Atop the balcony was the girl David had heard before. She looked like any other high school girl, except for the rather provocative uniform of a tight red and white miniskirt and matching cotton blouse. Her top buttons were undone and she displayed ample cleavage, and David could easily make out her pure white panties from his vantage point. <br />
<br />
David noticed that the girl was glaring toward the gym floor. He followed her gaze and saw a group of high school boys crowded together on the other side of the court. They appeared to be shouting and making gestures, but David couldn't hear a thing. <br />
<br />
David still unnoticed, snuck into a nearby office which he guessed was a coach's office. The lights were off but he was still able to see out into the gym via its large glass window. <br />
<br />
The girl turned to the observation area and started barking out orders. &quot;Looks like we got a rowdy bunch here. Keep em there for now but lets give them a chance to be heard.&quot; <br />
<br />
Immediately the room filled with the cries of a variety of obscenities from the boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get that pretty little ass down here you bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you up too?! let up go already!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When my father finds out about this, you are all gonna pay through the ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
David tried to make out what was going on, the boys all seemed to be tightly grouped in the back of the court. He saw a hallway leading out, David wondered why the boys didn't just make a run for it. Several of them even looked in that direction. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right.&quot; the girl stated &quot;let's get this started already. Bring down the containment field and get the tests ready.&quot; <br />
<br />
Several of the boys heard this over their comrades shouting. <br />
<br />
&quot;Their letting us out, c'mon lets get them now!&quot; <br />
<br />
At this several of them extended their arms apparently feeling for something. When nothing happened they all began to scatter. One boy ran full force to the balcony. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wham&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as the boy reached the center of the court he hit some kind of invisible wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is always one&quot; the girl muttered. &quot;I didn't say bring all the walls down. What kind of test would this be without subjects?&quot; <br />
<br />
Groans and angry yells from the other side of the court confirmed that there was another wall blocking their escape. <br />
<br />
The girl clapped her hands. &quot;Now that we are ready. Let's get the testing started!&quot; <br />
<br />
Four teenage beauties emerged from a door below the balcony. Each girl help a gun that looked like a giant pistol. The girls even had to use both hands to carry them. David frantically started to look for some kind of weapon of his own and his mind raced trying to come up with a strategy to save the boys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please! No! Don't kill us, we won't tell anyone about this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down! We don't have the slightest intention of killing any of you! To do so would be a waste, and the masters would hate for us to be wasteful&quot; The balcony girl replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Masters? Just who the hell are you guys!&quot; one of boys screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The masters took us here, much like you were and we were for a time...useful to them. However, they believe that we have been used up. We have gathered here to show the masters that we can still be useful to them. Hopefully, they will reward us for our efforts and may even prove to be useful again.&quot; When she said this the young girl smiled blissfully and several of the other girls even make cooing sounds. <br />
<br />
The girl shook herself from her fantasy. &quot;All right, all right, as I was saying. These are not deadly weapons, but you still are going to want to avoid them. Think of it as a game of dodgeball. If you are hit, you will be 'out'. The game ends after 30 minutes or if all of you are eliminated. Those who manage to stay in the game for that long will get a 'special' reward.&quot; The girl winked at them and blew them a kiss. <br />
<br />
The boys murmured among one another. Most appeared agitated, but concluded that they didn't have a choice either way. <br />
<br />
David prepared himself for the worst. He managed to find a golf club in the room. He dared not leave the room yet, the door was still visible to the four armed girls and if they spotted him, he would be an easy target. He hated to wait but if their focus was completely on the boys he would at least have a shot of sneaking up on them. He only hoped that this was really only a strange game. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right. Let the games begin! Amy take the first shot!&quot; <br />
<br />
The boys immediately scattered. Some even took cover behind one another. One of girls stepped up and tried to steady the gun as best she could with her small body. She had to use her entire hand to pull back the trigger. <br />
<br />
Krzapp! <br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAHHHHH!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pistol fired a green bolt of energy, but the bolt went wild and hit the ceiling as the recoil flung the girl backwards where she landed on her well padded butt. <br />
<br />
Several boys began to laugh. Mostly to let of steam from the fear they had felt moments before. Others remained serious, not letting their guard down. <br />
<br />
The girl on the balcony leaned over and looked at Amy. &quot;Someone make a note. A fully charged battery still causes massive recoil. Amy, stop flashing the boys your panties and get up. Jasmine, you're up. Next test is with a 75% battery&quot; <br />
<br />
The next girl stepped up as Amy picked herself from the floor. Jasmine had the body of a teenage idol, appeared to have a much stronger frame then Amy. She took aim and fired. The pistol still jerked a bit but the bolt still stayed mostly on target. Fortunately, the intended boy ducked in time for it to sail over his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did that one feel Jasmine?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine turned up the balcony with an agitated look on her face. &quot;It only jumped a little, but I still think the bolts aren't fast enough. Also, that ridiculous green color make them too easy to see!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Green is my favorite color! so they are staying green! As for the speed, there isn't much we can do about that. If they moved any faster they would harm the target.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fear further dissipated from the boys. A couple of the boys began to take positions closer to the middle of court. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right, all right, Amber show Jasmine how it is done! My calculations clearly show that 65% is our magic number. <br />
<br />
The third girl was about the same size as Jasmine. She smiled sweetly as she took aim at one of the closer boys and fired.<br />
<br />
The boy saw that he was being targeted and quickly jumped and rolled away. However, there was a unfortunate boy who was standing behind him and was struck by the strange bolt. The boy cried out and staggered a bit after the blow, but it was not enough to know him off his feet. The other boys scampered away from him but kept their eyes on him to see his fate. <br />
<br />
The boy glowed green for a brief moment, he was still bracing himself, but when he felt that nothing was wrong he stood up, confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Adam, you feel alright man?&quot; one of boys asked moving slowly closer to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, it didn't hurt or nothin. Actually, I am starting to feel kinda.....good&quot; Adam started to get a far off look to his face and he started blankly at the girl on the balcony. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit man! What the fuck!&quot; a boy yelled pointing to the growing tent in Adam's shorts.  <br />
<br />
Adam payed no attention to the boy and began to hump the air. His erection going bigger and stretching the seems of his shorts. Suddenly, Adam thrust out his hips completely and moaned loudly. His shorts jerked and a dark spot appeared at the tip. Adam was breathing heavily and had a perverted smile on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you mean to tell me these bitches built a gun that makes you cream your jeans?&quot; <br />
<br />
The boys continued to back away and several made gagging sounds, and rude comments as they did so. <br />
<br />
Adam began to spasm and moan once again. Something seemed different this time. The boys' full attention was on Adam, when they suddenly heard from the balcony. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yoooouuuuurrrrrrr OUT!&quot; yelled the girl making a thumbs out gesture. <br />
<br />
The boys returned their attention to Adam. He was gasping....sweating....changing. He was shrinking down to a smaller frame. His erection got smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible beneath his shorts. His eyes went wide and his hands shot toward his crotch. His fingers desperately searching for something. Adam took in deeper and deeper breaths and the boys' noticed 2 orbs growing beneath his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, he is turning into a girl!&quot; one boy screamed.<br />
<br />
Adam looked down terrified, his whole body shaking. &quot;Someone do something!&quot; he immediately covered his mouth. His voice had already become higher and girly. <br />
<br />
Adam fell to his knees as he did his hair appeared to float as it rapidly grew and fell softly on his shoulders. His chest continued to fill out, pulling on the cotton fabric of his white gym shirt. His face shifted and his features became softer. Soon there was no trace of the boy who was Adam.<br />
<br />
The girl sat there on her knees catching her breath. The boys' looked at one another confused and horrified by what they had witnessed. Adam's hands returned to her crotch, she started to feel at the stain her former member had left behind. She brought one hand to her face and took in the smell. At this her cheeks began to flush and her other hand began to rub the stain into her new sex. She sucked her nimble fingers and she began to look at her observers with lust in her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;All right! All right! Now that is what I call a success! Let's continue, I want to see if our new breeder will serve as a useful distraction to our remaining subjects.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four girls all readied themselves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fire at will!!&quot;</p>
