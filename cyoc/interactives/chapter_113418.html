<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">moments later while Damon (Blackfire) and Kate were walking in town that Kate spotted a flyer as they were mostly posted around town every. Kate ran up to one as it was about a dragon race. looking over Kate&#39;s shoulder to see what got her excited about that when Damon saw the dragon racing flyer as it talked about how exciting it would be made him think about having Kate as a riding partner, but he doesn&#39;t know anything about it.<br />
<br />
Kate then turned around to meat Damon and said to him, &quot;Blackfire, this may sound strange and sudden, but will you be my dragon partner for the dragon race?&quot; &quot;as long it&#39;s ok with your parents. and if so, I promise, I will keep you safe during the race.&quot; Damon said as Kate smiled from ear to ear with happiness and gave Damon a sudden hug. &quot;thanks Blackfire, i knew my dragon friend would understand how i feel.&quot; this made him a little happy as well that he hope her parents were ok with this. &quot;besides, i could do a little training while learning about the dragon race.&quot; Damon thought as they went home to Kate&#39;s house, immediately as She was already done for today.<br />
<br />
once they were at her home as it was more like a open ranch area that Damon felt a little at ease. &quot;This is where i live Blackfire. Wait until you meet my parents. They&#39;re very nice and understanding&quot; said Kate. Kate&#39;s parents then came out and hugs their daughter as They were happy to see their daughter home. &quot;Welcome home my dear. Did you run into any trouble along the way and back?&quot; Her mother ask. &quot;No mother. the day went fine as always.&quot;<br />
<br />
That is when they noticed Damon. &quot;Who&#39;s this young dragon Kate?&quot; her father asked. &quot;His names Blackfire, and He&#39;s my new dragon friend&quot; said Kate. &quot;well then, it&#39;s very Nice to meet you Blackfire. Kate said she always wanted a dragon friend by her side.&quot; Kate&#39;s mother said. it&#39;s very nice to meet you to ma&#39;am.&quot; Damon said as he then bowed down in front of Kate&#39;s parents. &quot;oh! so he&#39;s not only nice, but polite too.&quot; Kate&#39;s mother said as her father was inspecting Damon&#39;s dragon body as he was approved of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;mom, dad, i know that this sudden and all, but can Blackfire and i enter the dragon race? Blackfire said that he will keep me safe during the race, he even promised me to it.&quot; both of Kate&#39;s parents looked at each other with worry looks as they the looked at them and her mother said, &quot;well, we know this day would come, but could we take to Blackfire while you get ready to train him for the race. Blackfire might not know about the rules of the race.&quot; she then immediately went up stairs to gather up her things while they looked at Damon for a chat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Blackfire, we know that she&#39;s a very young girl as this will be her first race, but even during the race, will you promise to keep our daughter safe while we are away? we&#39;re not sure how lone we are going to be gone, but will you watch over her like she was your own daughter?&quot; Kate&#39;s mother said as her husband even added that it would mean the world to he. Damon then lowered his head and said to them, &quot;like my life&#39;s depending on it. I promise.&quot; they both then hugged around Damon&#39;s head as Kate was going down the stairs as she was confuse on what she was seeing. &quot;did I miss something?&quot; Kate asked as they were breaking up the hug scene.<br />
<br />
Later as it was getting late that Kate&#39;s parents were packed and had left for there long trip while Kate and Damon were training for the big dragon race as Damon had a hard time running with the gears of the saddle, the reins, even a special bondage gear for his wings as there was a rule for no flying. Kate was also having trouble staying on Damon while they were practice running that she fell off almost every time from Damon&#39;s speed, hitting branches, jumps, even hard turns as they trained for days. eventually they got better with each passing day that they were singed up for the race already as they continued to train to get better for the race. each night when it was time for bed as Damon had to sleep in the barn with another dragon in there, much younger then him that even Kate came and sleeps with him as she pets Damon&#39;s dragon snout each night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go Blackfire.&quot; Kate said as she covers you with a big enough blanket. &quot;I&#39;ll see you in the morning.&quot; as she gives him a kiss on his snout which Damon smiles at. &quot;good night Blackfire, Sleep tight.&quot; and with that, Kate was fast asleep with Damon near by. &quot;Maybe I should stay a dragon for Kate.&quot; Damon said in his thoughts while looking down at Kate sleeping close by. He kept on hearing the other dragon as it to wanted to sleep with them as Damon lifted his wing (when he&#39;s not doing any racing that is) and said to the young one, &quot;come on other, there&#39;s room for you to.&quot; that made the dragon happy as it snuggled next to Damon as it was also keeping Kate warm each night. Damon soon falls asleep and starts to have dreams when he was still a Prince. he misses those days.</p>
