<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Its awesome being me. I get to do exactly what I want all day. I always have fun, I'm always horny and I can find some creative ways to solve that problem! Still, if you were me you'd find that everyone else pretty much has to play by my rules. Its as if no one else is there. You might say I've always stood out from the crowd(that makes me laugh!) There is no one else quite like me. Basically I'm just like your average 23 year old guy, just out wanting to have a good time, live life to the full. There are a few differences between me and your average guy though, firstly I do have a good time and live life to the full, no reason why I shouldn't. Secondly, I'm a bit bigger than most people, well actually a lot bigger. And stronger. Thats why no one argues with me. I don't set out to be malicious, but if you get in the way of my fun, thats not my fault. Let me describe a typical day in the life of me.<br />
<br />
I like to take care of myself, judging by the amount of muscle I've got I do a pretty good job of it, fuck! I love my body so much! My arms look like a small mountain range, my pecs are a small mountain range and you people could climb up my abs! As for legs, well, its hard to find words to do them justice. Anyway, I went for a bit of a swim, trouble is I have to get a hell of a long way out before my legs don't touch the bottom. I usually go out there for food as much as anything. I get through quite a few ships in an average day, this muscle uses a lot of protein. I found one ship this morning, swam over to out and reached my arms out underneath it, then I flexed,the <br />
peaks of my arms lifted the whole fucking ship out of the water. Could you do that? Didn't think so. I soon finished that one off and decided to go back to shore for a bit of fun. I decided to try somewhere new today, not that I had much choice, the buildings in your average city make reasonable weights (not that they're nearly heavy enough) but they don't last too long, and what that hadn't finished off my insatiable horniness had! After a few miles I came across some hills, they came roughly up to the top of my thighs. Looking across the top I could see a city in the distance. I grinned as I watched the sun glinting off the tall buildings, and there were plenty! This was going to be a great day. I flexed my incredible muscles, already feeling pumped and full of atomic like power in anticipation. Big mistake. Like I said earlier, I love my body,maybe <br />
a little too much. I know every single fiber of muscle in it, and I love the colossal strength and power it gives me. Fuck! it makes me so horny. I stood there for ages, flexing and feeling my muscles, my hands running across megatons of pure power. YEAAAHHH! I let out a roar which shook the earth and echoed around for miles. I felt like a fucking god! I am! Then I noticed that there were a few small villages perched on top of the hills. I looked at the size of them, and then the size of me and I felt horny like you wouldn't believe. My god cock was harder than granite. I moved round and put one foot down on the other side of the hill, the impact of the colossal pillar of muscle hitting the ground made the earth shake for miles. Slowly I lowered myself down, my butt sinking several feet into the rock. I flexed my glutes, the hard granite being ground away against the muscle felt great, fucking awesome! I began to position myself, it must have been chaos in that village, my huge muscle dick swinging round just a few feet above the houses. Took a deep breath then plunged my colossal meat deep into the hill, the village obliterated instantly by my dick. Too bad it was in the way. I breathed out sharply sending a blast of air over another small village just beneath my head, it made a hurricane seem like a gentle breeze, people, cars, houses were flying through the air. It felt great though, tons of earth and rock being compacted by tons of solid meat! I pounded away at the mountain, shouting out with pleasure, my fists just landing everywhere as I threw my arms around. I could feel the mountain beginning to give way a little where my quads and calves were eating into it. I wasn't even trying! Fuck was I horny though. <br />
<br />
Then I heard a noise, I quickly glanced across towards the city, scores of tiny planes were heading towards me. I didn't take much notice, not a lot can hurt me. They thought they could though, in fact they did me a favor! I can't remember the last time I had such a good fuck. I let out a deafening moan of pleasure when the bombs started to hit. They rained down on my back and my glutes, which were <br />
flexing up in the air. It was like having a massage, it felt so good, waves of pleasure went right through my body, I was close but not close enough when the bombing stopped, the planes incapable of holding enough ammunition to bring me to climax. I slammed my fist on the ground in anger. The seismic waves must have caused a small land slide or something, but suddenly I felt the earth shift around my cock a little. With a deafening roar I started to pump my load into the hill. The whole thing began to bulge, like a volcano just before it erupts, but this time it was the sheer force of my cum forcing the <br />
rock apart. I made sure my feet were steady as I continued to pump my <br />
awesome load. Without warning, the whole thing exploded. Thousands of tons of rock and mud went streaming down the valley on a tidal wave of my cum, pouring into the outskirts of the city. I lay down in the sun, totally relaxed and lazily picking the cattle out of a nearby field and started thinking about what I could do tomorrow. I glanced across at the city, maybe I could come back and finish what I started.</p>
