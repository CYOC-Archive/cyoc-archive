<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felix decided to surrender to his greyhound body and its instincts whenever possible.  Tony was doing it!  Tony's an intellectual kid too.  Hell, he's been called a bookworm almost as many times as me, Felix told himself.  If he can completely go with this new, doggy flow, so can I.  <br />
<br />
Felix followed right behind the furiously whipping tail of his buddy Tony.  His girlfriend Claire was rubbing hise golden furred face and talking baby talk to Tony the way some owners do to their dogs.  Though his mind was unchanged and it must have seemed incredibly silly to him as it did to Felix, Tony was physically a greyhound now.  He longed for the affection of his master and Claire's petting of him and talking to him in an affectionate tone made Tony feel great.  <br />
&quot;Woof!&quot;<br />
He let out an involuntary bark of enthusiasm and rubbed his new 60 pound body even more forcefully against her legs.  Then Claire turned to Felix and rubbed his face.  <br />
&quot;Oh, my Felix boy!  Look at you my Felix helix!  Look at you!&quot; she cooed and Felix felt positively euphoric.  He found himself drooling and trying to rub the side of his body against her over and over.  He only stopped because she stepped away from him and gave Felix a swat to his fur covered ass.  <br />
&quot;Come on guys, let's go outside now&quot; said Claire opening the door to the room with one hand and gathering up the laptop and emitter with the other.<br />
<br />
Felix walked a little uncertainly going down a flight of stairs on four legs.  He just copied the way Tony, right ahead of him went down them and then went into a sprint once they were outside after Tony did.<br />
<br />
A Prius had just pulled out of a neighbor's driveway two houses up the road.  It lurched slowly forward just as Tony and Felix got outside.  Tony let out a little yip or bark and Felix somehow knew that Tony meant to race that car.  The sand and oil pavement and hedges at the front of the yards suddenly went by as if filmed from a moving car.  The two greyhounds, so recently 16 year old boys, ran with fantastically long strides, every streamlined limb gracefully gobbling up all the yardage possible, stretching as far as possible with each step.  Tony and Felix caught up to the Prius and then they passed it.  There was plenty of room on the road for all 3 and so the driver of the little car was not hesitant to race the two dogs.  Hell, his girlfriend was in the car next to him and she had always belittled his choice of vehicle.  He put his foot down but barely gained on the two greyhounds at all before they trotted to a halt at the bend in the road just before the intersection up the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof!  WoofWoof!&quot;<br />
God, that was fantastic, thought Felix.  We must have been running 40 miles an hour!  What a feeling of energy!  That's what this new body is made for!  That's why were so thin and streamlined.  It's our physical purpose.  A human being in nature might run to catch things or throw or be relatively sedentary but clever.  We're made to run, us greyhounds.  That's the one thing we're made for and doing it so magnificently feels terrific.<br />
<br />
Felix could see from the look in Tony's eyes that he felt the same way.  He also saw Tony give him a look that was somehow a challenge and they took off at the same time running back to Claire.  They were going so fast as they neared her that both newly minted greyhounds had to just put on the brakes for the last 20 yards.  Claire gave each a fresh round of hugs and pets and then they settled into a rhythm of trotting out front of her a couple steps as they all walked to the store.  Even this simple trot filled Felix with athletic pride.  He could keep ahead of Claire with scarcely more effort than a half push from two toes on each paw.<br />
<br />
At the supermarket entrance, Claire stopped the two boys turned dogs in front of the entrance.  &quot;You wait here while I go inside and get your food guys&quot;  Tony and Felix paced nervously.  Oh boy, dog food!  In his head, Felix laughed.  &quot;Look at us, practically drooling because Claire's going to get us some Alpo!  Ahahahahahaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Felix felt another impulse, too.  A man approached Claire in the aisle and bumped into her.  Felix and Tony both growled.  Claire was their master but they also felt compelled to protect her.  Both strode into the store immediately drawing the ire of the store manager.<br />
&quot;Hey!  Miss?  Are those your dogs?&quot;<br />
Claire looked at her boyfriend and Felix.  &quot;Yeah, they're mine&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, they can't come in here.  You've gotta tie 'em up outside or something.  They can't run loose in the parking lot either&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, they'll be fine.  They're smart dogs&quot; she said to the manager and turning to Tony and Felix pointed out through the glass storefront.  <br />
&quot;Go wait for me next to the F-250, guys&quot; she said then turned and went down an aisle.<br />
The manager shook his head.  &quot;Miss.  You can't just-&quot;<br />
He stopped.  The two greyhounds had trotted over to a Ford F-250 pickup parked near the entrance and sat their rears down.  The manager stared.  &quot;How the hell . . ?&quot; <br />
<br />
Claire bought two cans of Alpo and walked back to her house guarded by Tony and Felix.  She told her mother and father that she was watching a friend's dogs for her.  They came into the kitchen and petted Tony and Felix as they wolfed down the dog food Claire had put in bowls for them.  While they continued to eat, she stowed the laptop and emitter in her room.  With his hunger sated, Felix felt a wave of contentment wash over him stronger than any such satisfaction he'd ever felt as a boy.  After dinner, he and Tony followed Claire into the living room and each took up a sphinx-like pose on either side of the chair Claire sat in, at her feet.  She dispensed the occasional pat on the head to each of them to canine moans of contentment.<br />
<br />
When it came time to sleep, Claire first led them outside where each had a good long piss on one neighbor's shrubs and dropped his scat on those of another neighbor.<br />
&quot;Great&quot; said Claire as she let them back in.  &quot;when they ask me, I'll tell them that my boyfriend and his pal are just a bit territorial&quot;<br />
<br />
She led them up to her room.  She closed the door and then she undressed.  All the way.  To Felix's delight, lovely Claire slowly, tantalizingly tugged off her clothes in the half light of her bedside lamp.  At last, she undid her bra and stepped out of her white cotton panties.  Tony, her now greyhound boyfriend jumped up.  She caught his paws.  He rubbed his moist black nose on her round little breasts eliciting a squeal.  &quot;That tickles!&quot; she laughed and pushed his nose away.  &quot;You're a dog, Tony.  I may act like a bitch now and then but I'm not actually one&quot; she chuckled and closed her hand around her boyfriend's muzzle.  She turned it to one side and rubbed her face against the side of his.  &quot;I still love you even though you're just a dog, Tony, but . . I won't love you just now&quot; she said and laughed looking at Tony's greyhound penis, out of its sheath and gleaming, ready to go.  &quot;No matter your genus or your species you're ready when I am, aren't you Tony&quot; She chuckled and gave her boyfriend's ears a friendly rub then let go of his paws and jumped under the covers of her bed.  <br />
&quot;Come on boys!&quot; she said and patted the comforter atop her.  With no further prodding, Tony and Felix jumped atop the bed and lay across her.  They took a minute pushing and stretching and settling in and then stayed there atop her the whole night long.  Felix could only guess at what Tony was dreaming about, naked atop his naked girlfriend and consumed with desire but unable to act upon it.  Felix supposed Tony was acting upon it in his dreams.  <br />
<br />
Felix spent a night of heavenly slumber heated by the delicious heat of his pack leader beside him and his master beneath him.  His dreams were of naked Claire, of Laurie, the girl he'd been dating and, to his surprise, of Lassie.  Felix woke to the first light of morning, his little greyhound butt pumping slowly away on the comforter at the caboose of the imaginary collie.  Claire patted his shoulder.<br />
&quot;Come on guy, get up!&quot;<br />
Felix opened his eyes and let out a yelp of surprise.  Wh-What happened to my arms?!  They're covered with fur!  Ohmygod!  What's happened to my body.  I'm-I'm a dog!  What the hell's going on . . oh wait . . the chronivac.  I-I turned into a dog with . .&quot; he looked onto the floor of Claire's room where an identical dog was stretching.  &quot;With Tony.  He's a greyhound too&quot;  Felix calmed down, but as he imitated Tony's stretching on the floor, he was still a bit spooked by his dream of sex with Lassie.  It took hours of playing in the park with Tony and Claire, a frisbee and scores of kids.  <br />
<br />
It was pure play for Felix.  He had scarcely a conscious human thought for hours as he ran in the warm sun across the soft sod, luxuriating in the warmth of his fur and reveling in the electric speed with which he sprinted across it.  Little boys and girls pointed at Felix and gasped and shouted.  Adults smiled admiringly.  Felix let all of them pet him and soaked in their acts of adoration large and small.  He pissed to mark his territory on bushes at the edge of the park, he left his scat, he panted with his long tongue drooping out of his mouth, he stood up on his hind legs revealing his oversized, sheathed penis and he stood with his back to lovely women splayed out on sun drenched blankets so that his two furry balls could not be missed.  All this Felix did without a moment's hesitation for he was a dog.  <br />
<br />
He woke from a nap on his back beside Claire and Tony on her blanket and didn't even flinch when he saw had no hands but rather fur covered paws.  If Felix's rudimentary mental processes at that moment had produced conscious human thoughts they would have been along the lines of &quot;Yeah, I'm a dog.  This is great.  My head awash with pleasant smells and feels and instinctual responses&quot;<br />
<br />
As they neared Claire's house, Felix even started playing rough with Tony.  The two dogs ended up rolling over again and again on her front lawn, their open jaws locked together as each pushed with all his might.  Before he went back to being human, Felix wanted to feel what it felt like to be the alpha male of the pack.  In the end, Claire couldn't wait any longer while the two identical dogs wrestled and separated them.  But just the act of never having backed down made Felix feel different.  He didn't feel like he was Tony's boss in the pack, but he didn't feel the compulsion to follow Tony as they went into Claire's house.  He even stepped in front of Tony to receive his transforming jolt of electromagnetic energy from the Chronivac first.  <br />
<br />
Upon the electric wave passing through him, Felix immediately found he could stand upright.  And speak.<br />
&quot;Wow.  That was terrific.  Great call, boy&quot; said Felix patting still greyhound Tony with is suddenly human hands.  &quot;So completely satisfying in a subconceptual way!&quot; marveled Felix as his knees reverted to human configuration, bending forward not backward and his back paws became feet again as his body resumed his lean athletic shape.  &quot;I mean, even though my conceptual faculties were completely intact, as you promised, it almost seemed as though my canine body didn't require it.&quot; he said as his muzzle pulled back into the shape of Felix's handsome face and his little dog penis swelled and stretched and separated from his abdomen to hang lazily between his legs.  <br />
&quot;Oh, sorry&quot; said Felix covering it with two hands and turning away just in time to see in the mirror his altogether human body covered with a fine coat of golden fur lose all of it in a split second and become his fair skinned self.  <br />
<br />
Claire tossed Felix a pair of running pants that belonged to Tony and then the matching top as she turned the emitter at Tony.  While Felix watched, his friend shifted, over a minute's time from canis domesticus to homo sapien.  As always, it was in a different order.  Tony changed in every way but feeling comfortable upright and was his soft skinned self in every way before finally, his vertebrae changed and he could stand upright again.  He kissed Claire and dressed in the pants and shirt she handed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Felix.  You thought that was great.  Would you like to try another transformation?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;</p>
