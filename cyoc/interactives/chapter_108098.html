<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick drove down the street feeling good listing to music. He ran a red light then another then another. Pretty soon a cop on a motorcycle cought up with him. Patrick rolled down the window and knew what was going to happen. <br />
&quot; sir I&#39;m going to need you to p-, &quot; the cop took off his glasses and was frozen with shock. Patrick&#39;s face was a gift. As if God had spent a whole day on his body. The cop started to blush.<br />
&quot; it&#39;s okay officer I&#39;ll be more careful next time&quot;<br />
 Patrick said with a killer grime knowing he was getting away with it. The officer seemed to realize he was starring and not talking. <br />
You know I&#39;m out of gas maybe you can give me a ride to the station? If you do that I&#39;ll let you off the hook. &quot; the cop was lying and it was he worst pick up he had done but he was paralyzed with love over this man. And would do anything to spend another second looking at him.<br />
Patrick knew the cop was lying but decided it couldn&#39;t hurt for the cop to be put to work on his ride there.<br />
&quot; sure hope in&quot; Patrick said <br />
The cop entred and noticed a picture in the dash board.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this you &quot;he said pointing to the picture.<br />
&quot; no it&#39;s my twin sister. Of course it me you dumbass how many other men look that hot?&quot; <br />
The cop felt stupid for asking and wanted to make it up to him. <br />
&quot; give me a blowjob you idiot!&quot;Patrick said in his charismatic commanding voice <br />
The cop imediatly did as he was told and started to unzip Patrick&#39;s pants.<br />
&quot; not with your hands dumb fuck!! This is expensive shit do you really think im going to let you touch this with your dirty hands after you&#39;ve been riding around all day sweating in the dirty air.&quot; &quot; do it with your teeth &quot; Patrick barked <br />
The twink like cop struggled with the button and the belt but was rewarded with the most magnificent penis he has ever seen when he undid the zipper. It was huge and perfect and still growing. It stopped at 14 inches it looked bigger then an wine bottle. Patrick grabbed the mans head and forced him onto his dick. &quot; if your not gonna start sucking I&#39;ll make you do it.&quot; Patrick said <br />
They were almost at the station when Patrick climaxed all over the twink. The cop up off the dick becuase Patrick was still shooting jizz out like a fire hose. <br />
&quot; What are you doing you idiot now I&#39;m getting cum all over my car!!!!!! Lick it up like the stupid peasant you are. The officer did as he was told and locked up all the sperm. It tasted wonderful he couldn&#39;t get enough by the end of it he was eating for himself rather than becuase Patrick told him to. Patrick threw the cop out of his car and sped towards the campus. His phone rung he picked it up and answered. <br />
&quot; hey you hunky piece of man your lovers are waiting &quot; said Dan.<br />
See Patrick even at 24 had already married.......... multiple times. He had four husbands and four wives. His favorite husband Tyler was his work out partner and former best friend from elementary middle and high school. Flick and Marcus where twins who adored Patrick they where Patrick&#39;s favorite to have sex with. Fourth was Kyle. Kyle was a short 17 year old who had secretly married Patrick unknown to Kyle&#39;s friends and family becuase he was under age. Patrick found Kyle one day being bullied and getting the shit beat out of him and saved him. Kyle had broken three ribs his color and shoulder bone and was bruised all over. Kyle begged him not to go to the hospital because he his parents would now and they couldnt afford it. So he carried him to his apartment and brought him upstairs he cared for him and nursed him back to health in a mouth. Patrick had made it seem life Kyle was on a school vacation so his parents didn&#39;t get worried with the help of the chrovonic. Kyle and Patrick and fallen deeply in love in those five weeks.Kyle gave Patrick deep meaningful sex that Patrick always felt like a better person afterwards. He kept Kyle at his house with his other husband and wives while he banged his high school teacher so Kyle could skip two grades and get college credits and his diploma early.  Kyle was Patrick&#39;s most recent husband they got married two mounted ago. Amelia was Kyle&#39;s oldest spouse there seven year anniversary was coming up she was an extremely hot Scandinavian model. Regina and Sophia like flick and Marcus where Patrick&#39;s fuck toys on the feminine side. They were slutty twin sisters who knew how to treat Patrick in the bedroom. Lastly Scarlet was Patrick&#39;s slave anything and I mean anything Patrick needed or wanted or even thought of ten minutes ago scarlet would&#39;ve done it already. She was the best and the only maid they needed around the apartment. Although she wasn&#39;t just a cleaner she could gave men and women amazing pleasure. She had the biggest boobs without surgery in the world that produced the most delicious milk. She had a dick but before you get grossed out it it was like heaven to have up your ass. Speaking of which her ass must&#39;ve been shaped from heaven all the perfect curves. He pussy was to die for and many men had in fact died for it <br />
Patrick thought about all his spouses at home he couldn&#39;t wait to get back there.<br />
I miss you guys Patrick said I&#39;ll be back in time for dinner. He almost got out of the car and closed the door but saw the chrovonic and made a few changes. He grew his beard out more he added more chest and body hair. He added 80 pounds of muscle onto his frame making him 285 pounds. But then decided to thin himself out so that he wouldn&#39;t have any body fat at all he would be 100% muscles.He now was 280 pounds but still wanted to be bigger he added 20 more pounds of muscle to compensate for his loss in weight. Instead of veins on his arms he know had thick warm hides that pumped his blood. And made his dick 15 inches soft 25 inches hard. And balls  the size of  cantaloupes. He added a few more changes into his sperm for an extra surprise for when his lovers got fucked. He grew himself to a massive height of 8 feet two inches and made himself in the one percent. He stripped off his cloths in public( which wasn&#39;t a crime anymore it was a trea for the people) and put on a baby blue speedo and walked into his college.</p>
