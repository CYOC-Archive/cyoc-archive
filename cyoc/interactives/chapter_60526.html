<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, Jeff, what's the big deal?&quot; Dre asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, weez all here now like you ask-ed,&quot; Miguel said eagerly.  He had been the first to arrive and was most <br />
frustrated that Jeff wouldn't tell them what was going on until everyone arrived.<br />
<br />
Marcus playing it cool just sat there, but his eyes moved and his body shifted slightly forward on the desk to <br />
hear what Jeff would say.<br />
<br />
Eric was fiddling with his jacket zipper which hung right over his crotch while seated, and glanced up, &quot;Yeah, <br />
mate, what did ya call us all here for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, first, tell me what article of clothing you would be if you were an article of clothing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hell, we're going to play what if games?&quot; Dre said rolling his eyes, &quot;Okay, I'd be that Miley Cyrus <br />
chick's panties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no that's not exactly what I meant,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;See I've got a new computer program that morphs people <br />
into clothes, and well, for the sake of argument say I am the male mannequin, and you were to be an article of <br />
clothing dressing that mannequin what would you be?  Be as detailed as you can so I can get the program <br />
right,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
He pulled up the simulator on the screen.  There was a naked photo of him on the screen which morphed into a <br />
mannequin version of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that bulge on the mannequin looks bigger than what's in your pants,&quot; chortled Eric.<br />
<br />
Everyone just looked at him in silence - definitely a closet case.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay, so if I'm going to morph into your clothing?&quot; Dre said, &quot;What should I be?  Hey, I'm the jock!&quot;<br />
<br />
He noticed Eric's crestfallen expression, apparently that's what he wanted to be, so he added, &quot;And Eric can <br />
be the cup that fits inside me, if likes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks, but I think I'll be leather chaps like on the mannequin at Hot Topic,&quot; Eric said, &quot;Or maybe <br />
leather jeans? Or shorts?&quot; He rubbed his chin in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay?&quot; Jeff said, &quot;You decide on that, Eric.  Now, Dre, be specific about the jockstrap. Is it cotton?  Or <br />
synthetic? Or white or red or blue or what?  Is it a brand name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, the jockstrap is marked XXX CUSTOM JOCK BY DRE and numbered one of one.  It's gold thread on black <br />
spandex. The waistband is three inches seamless, and the pouch is ribbed for support but with a sheer black <br />
mesh, so nothing's hidden, and there's a big black D embroidered on the pouch.  The elastic leg strap and <br />
waistband are covered in like black satin spandex real rich looking, and it hugs the wearer or mannequin in <br />
this case like a glove. The pouch scoops under and lifts the balls away from the body and cradles them,&quot; he <br />
said with a grin, &quot;That detailed enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff finished typing. &quot;That's perfect,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
On the screen a black and gold jockstrap appeared on the mannequin.<br />
<br />
Miguel said, &quot;Me next.  I wanna be at skintight plain white t-shirt.  The kind that looks like it was painted <br />
on.  So friggin' tight that it makes your nipples hard just wearing it, but with longer sleeves, so you can <br />
roll up a pack of cigarettes in one of them and the other rolled up sleeve creates a muscle shirt look that <br />
make your biceps look bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you only wear loose clothes all the time?  What's with the skintight?&quot; Dre asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I dressing Jeff, not me. I'd be his skintight t-shirt,&quot; Miguel said definitively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, polished cotton or spandex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blend of Mexican cotton, spandex and lycra,&quot; Miguel answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Jeff said mentally noting that Miguel was a closet case too.  Or else he thought Jeff was!<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, decide yet?  I've already got underwear and a shirt?  Do you want to be jacket or jeans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Motorcycle leathers. That's it.  The kind that zip down your legs and arms to form fit sealing your body in <br />
heavy but soft and buttery black leather. The stuff so good, you can see the outline of the jockstrap and the <br />
t-shirt through the tight buttery leather.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that's gay!&quot; Dre cracked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's just manly.  I saw something like it on TV, it was like $5000 or something.  Custom fitted to that <br />
extreme athlete on the Mountain Dew commercial, I forget his name. And the only reason it's black and not <br />
distressed brown is because you made your jockself black,&quot; Eric explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that's good detail,&quot; Jeff said typing.<br />
<br />
Eric peered over his shoulder as the image began to appear, and kibbutzed, &quot;No, no pockets, except a straight <br />
up and down zipper on the side of each thigh. But you won't put anything in those pockets. They're just for <br />
show, and tighter on the butt. You're wearing a jockstrap, so the seat should fill your crease.&quot; He even <br />
pushed Jeff aside and typed a few things, before letting Jeff finish up.<br />
<br />
Marcus sat up and said, &quot;Well, I guess that leaves me to be the boots. Nice shiny polished black boots, sturdy <br />
supportive, Italian leather with wood heels and steel toes, and silver buckles.&quot; He too leaned over Jeff's <br />
shoulder and made comments on how to adjust things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, how does it look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we were clothing designers I'd say it looked okay,&quot; Marcus said, &quot;But come on is that what you <br />
wanted us to see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, this is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Run simulation.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the four guys appeared on the screen buck naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, did you take our pix in the locker room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncool, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, look at that?&quot;<br />
<br />
First, naked Dre's image started to shrink and his skin darkened, the outline of a capital D formed on his <br />
face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess, your face is Jeff's jockstrap pouch!&quot; laughed Eric.<br />
<br />
Then, Eric's body started to twist and contort, then doubled over and started to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, Eric, dude, looks like we're going to be neighbor's your head's down forming part of Jeff's crotch <br />
cover or is that his seat?&quot; Dre asked turning his head trying to figure it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha,ha, hey, I just turned white!&quot; laughed Miguel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this is rather cool, Jeff. Heh, heh, I'm beside myself,&quot; laughed Marcus as he watched himself becoming <br />
a pair of boots.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Jeff said, &quot;That was the simulation.  Now for the real thing.  I'll set the changes for one week, and <br />
excute!&quot; he clicked the keyboard and looked up with a grin.<br />
<br />
The others looked nervously at each other.  They could feel a static electric charge coursing over their skins <br />
making their body hairs stand up all over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, man?&quot; Marcus asked wide-eyed looking at Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, man.  I got me a Chronivac!&quot; Jeff exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, dude, promise me you're going to shower befo-&quot; Dre said as his collapsed to his knees his face was <br />
covered with heavy ribbing and a big black D was superimposed on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;And wear socks!&quot; Marcus ordered.<br />
<br />
Eric looked amazed and then grinned broadly.  He was thinking about the subtle adjustments he had typed in, <br />
and how it would feel to hug Jeff's body 24/7 for a week.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I should be recording this!&quot; Jeff said slapping his head and grabbing his video camera. He began <br />
filming his partially morphed friends as they completed their transformation.</p>
