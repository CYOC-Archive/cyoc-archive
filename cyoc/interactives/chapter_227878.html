<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It felt like an eternity as Antonio sat on the bed, his gaze locked on the bathroom panel, the sounds of Mantis violently throwing up having stopped for a while now, yet the door stayed shut, looking to his left Antonio cracked a small smile as E was also sat on the bed, copying him, staring at the door, however she couldn&#39;t seem to sit still, her legs swinging off the edge as she waited with Antonio.<br />
&quot;You nervous too huh?&quot; He asked, E had no response, she continued staring at the door, almost like he didn&#39;t exist<br />
&quot;Good talk&quot; he mumbled, before at long last the beep of the bathroom panel opening sounded and slid open, Mantis standing in the doorframe, her face as white as a sheet, her expression that of shock and disbelief, her arms folded over her stomach.<br />
&quot;E, can you go in the small room for a minute, me and Antonio need to talk&quot; she said in a small and tired voice, to both their surprise E shot up and bounded over to Mantis and wrapped her arms around her, burying her face in her chest once again, Mantis let out a small laugh before nudging her along, the small girl complying and almost marching to the room, the panel sliding shut behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to talk&quot; Mantis said in a stern voice as she walked over to sit beside Antonio who cautiously put his arm supporting around her waist, Mantis didn&#39;t move.<br />
&quot;Just what the fuck are you&quot; she whispered, Antonio looking at her confused<br />
&quot;What the fuck kind of swimmers do you have man, a day, A DAY ago me and you fucked, sure it was Alot of sex, but still, and now, I&#39;ve just checked my systems, and....and i- I&#39;m, I&#39;m pregnant&quot; she said, fear in her eyes as she said it, her hands instinctively flying to her stomach as she said it.<br />
Antonio was lost for words, his mouth opening and closing like a gasping fish as he searched for the words to say.<br />
&quot;So now, I want the truth, who or what are you because no normal dude can knock a woman up in a day&quot; she said now standing in front of him, arms crossed over her chest, Antonio could only look at the floor and sigh before looking her in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told you&quot; he sighed, Mantis raising an eyebrow and scoffing &quot;pft, please, in this city nothing can supprise me, try me&quot;<br />
Antonio shrugged his shoulders as he stood up from the bed<br />
&quot;Fuck, where to begin, we&#39;ll for starters, your right, I&#39;m not normal, I&#39;m not from here, or anywhere near here, not even from this reality, I used to be a normal guy, a cat burglar, barely getting buy, then one day I found this strange device, god what was it called......oh yeah, a Chronivac, it freaked out on me and sent me here, woke up in an alleyway and was found by Mia and Lucy&quot;<br />
Taking a deep breath after his rushed explanation he looked to see Mantis&#39;s response, her eyes were wide, her face Paul as she took in what he was saying, tears began to spill over her eyelashes, running down her cheeks as she furiously wiped them away, she turned her back on him and looked to the ceiling, her hands bracing her back as she took a calming breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, say I believe this wild as fuck story, what proof do you have, if your from another reality then show me proof of this device&quot; she said, her voice sounding more and more pissed off.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t, the device blew up, it&#39;s how I got sent here&quot; he said, throwing his hands up in defence as Mantis turned to look at him, but then he remembered something, the chip, the chip Mia tried to take the day he arrived!<br />
&quot;Mantis I can prove it, the chip, I&#39;ve got a chip marked Chronivac, see for yourself&quot; eager to show her he frantically tried to reach the chip compartment on the back of his neck, dancing around the room in a flurry as he tried to get it.<br />
<br />
Mantis couldn&#39;t help but laugh at his display before putting her hands on his shoulders and pushing him to his knees on the ground<br />
&quot;Stay still you fucking idiot, your dancing like a mecha ballerina&quot; she laughed before pulling the chip, staring at it curiously<br />
&quot;Apparently it can change reality to whatever I want, but it&#39;s only registered to me&quot; Antonio informed her as she examined the chip against the florescent lights before inserting it back into it&#39;s compartment.<br />
&quot;Alright then, do it, change something here, change me, anything&quot; she challenged, stretching her arms either side of her as she stood in the middle of the room<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never used it before but I can give it a go&quot; he said unsure of himself, desperately trying to activate the chip, trying to change anything about Mantis<br />

Nothing happened, Antonio didn&#39;t understand, he saw the Systems fire up, he had input the commands, and yet nothing happened, Mantis looked at Antonio with a sad expression, letting her arms fall as she turned to walk away, however just as she was about to, she froze on the spot, her breath catching before letting out a loud lustful groan, a lot ripping sound emanating from Mantis as she leaned forward, her breath panting hard as if out of breath, then she straightened up with some difficulty and spun to face Antonio.<br />
Her once modist B cup bust had ballooned outwards into a pair of firm and round H cups, Mantis&#39;s camo bomber jacket now forced open, and her white tank top split down the middle to make room for her new womanly orbs, lifting them both with her hands to better examine what had happened to her, only for her to cry out in pleasure as the pressure of lifting her new udders sent steams of rich creamy milk flying across the room<br />
&quot;What- what the fuck happened to my tits?, did- did you do this Antonio?&quot; She moaned in disbelief, Antonio grinning as the fabric of her tank top barely held together, he nodded at her and walked over, offering her a hand to get up off the floor, which she gladly accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You- you horny fucker, you gave me fucking cow udders here, there&#39;s so much milk in there, I can feel it all sloshing around&quot; she groaned as she leaned agains Antonio not yet ready to take the full weight of her new body on her own<br />
&quot;Milk?&quot; Came a small familiar voice, there stood in the doorway E was watching them both curiously, Mantis&#39;s face going completely red as she desperately tried to cover herself, to no avail, Antonio walking Mantis over to sit on the edge of the bed, chuckling as he hears her moan in relief as she sat down<br />
&quot;Oh so you know that word huh?&quot; Antonio chuckled to E, watching as she timidly walked over to himself and Mantis, each step like she was walking on glass, until at last she made it to them, her hands folded behind her back untill they heard her stomach growl, E&#39;s eyes fixated on Mantis&#39;s new milk balloons as her stomach called out for nourishment.<br />
<br />
Mantis looked nervous as she gently cupped her engorged tits, pulling them free from her destroyed tank top and offered one to E<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok, I won&#39;t hurt you, your hungry, you need to eat, and I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s not much in terms of food here at the moment&quot; she said, as calming and soothing as she could manage under the high amounts of pressure and pleasure her body was currently under<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you even start you horndog, if your gonna turn me into a milk factory may as well put those puppies to good use&quot; she groaned as she smirked up at Antonio, before letting out a yelp of supprise, E had latched onto her dark, swollen nipple, her mechanics of her missing section of her face seeming to be surprisingly gentle and soft, mechanisms unfolding and shaping themselves to create a perfect yet slow suction over Mantis&#39;s teat.<br />
<br />
Mantis but her bottom lip as she suppressed her moans, gently stroking the back of E&#39;s head as she fed from her<br />
&quot;Well there&#39;s two things down, you believe me now, and we&#39;ve got her, at least some what happy and safe&quot; Antonio chimed, Mantis looking up at him with a serious look<br />
&quot;We still have alot to talk about, it&#39;s not as simple as  hey I&#39;m from another reality everything&#39;s good now, now we gotta make it in this city on our own, and now with me knocked up and now with people most likely hunting for E, it&#39;s not gonna be a cakewalk, even with whatever that chip can do, because I bet it&#39;s got fucking limits&quot; Mantis whispered, Both of them now looking down at the small cybergirl as she fed<br />
&quot;Well think of something, I know we will&quot;</p>
