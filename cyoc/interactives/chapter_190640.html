<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jordan felt a faint sliver of light shine over his closed eyes, and woke to the feeling of his body having become compressed on either side of him. Bound by this strange form of warm mass, he remembered he was still in between Toby’s enormous breasts. She must have turned in her sleep, Jordan thought to himself. Willing his body to move, he inched and crawled his way out from the giantess’s bosom and dropped to the floor. Morning light peered in through a ground-level window into the basement, illuminating his surroundings. Walking away from Toby, Jordan is able to view the sleeping giant in better light. He then recalled that she would remain asleep until he stated otherwise.<br />
<br />
“Shrink to eight feet tall,” said Jordan to the sleeping Toby. The titanic body before him steadily shifted and diminished, reaching a reasonable size to better navigate the house. “You will wake up shortly after I leave, carrying on with your own life as normal.” Jordan then turned and made his way up the stairs, through the living room and out the front door, exiting quietly so as not to disturb no one.<br />
<br />
Looking around, the outside world appeared more massive for the three-foot-four Jordan than before. He walked down the sidewalk of the suburban neighborhood until he came upon a bus stop and waited patiently. Minutes later, the city transit arrived and Jordan boarded it. The bus driver, a middle-aged woman, looked down at Jordan awaiting to pay his fare. He looked up nervously, and quickly said, “I, uh, don’t need to pay.”<br />
<br />
With a shrug, the driver turned her attention back toward the road after closing the door behind Jordan. Relieved, he walked down the aisle in search of an empty seat. While there are plenty of vacant spots, Jordan caught sight of a young woman with dirty blonde hair sitting alone near the window. Making his way towards her, he spoke up, “Excuse me? You don’t mind if I sit here.”<br />
<br />
“Not at all,” said the woman. Jordan hopped onto the seat and settled in. Looking her over, she appeared to be around Jordan’s age. Her figure is average from what he could tell through her baggy sweater and long pants. “I’m Jordan,” he said towards her.<br />
<br />
“Tabitha,” she replied, not paying the short man much attention.<br />
<br />
“Where’re you headed?”<br />
<br />
“Just downtown to visit a friend.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t mind if I sit on your lap until we get there,” said Jordan, with a newfound sense of boldness.<br />
<br />
“Of course not,” said Tabitha. She then lifted Jordan with all of her strength and placed him atop her thighs as if he were her own child. “You are a bit heavy, though.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that,” said Jordan. “I’ll shrink to two feet tall.” Within seconds, he diminished and the interior of the bus grew larger around him. Tabitha’s face loomed higher over his head. “Better?”<br />
<br />
“Much better,” she said without much reaction to the shrinking man.<br />
<br />
“Tell me about this friend of yours.”<br />
<br />
“His name is Trevor, and we’re supposed to be meeting for a lunch date.”<br />
<br />
“How long have you two known each other?”<br />
<br />
“Not that long. We exchanged messages through a dating app.”<br />
<br />
Before Jordan spoke, his stomach growled loudly. Realizing he had not eaten breakfast yet, he looked up at Tabitha and said, “Sorry. Could you please breastfeed me?”<br />
<br />
“I suppose I can,” said Tabitha as she rolled her eyes. Pulling her sweater over her chest, she revealed a bra that now appeared damp with milk. Peeling back the left cup, Jordan latched onto her exposed nipple and began to suckle. After a few minutes of feeding, he let go, wiping milk from his lips. “Thank you,” he said to her.<br />
<br />
“No problem,” replied Tabitha, who seemed to not be embarrassed by this sudden act.<br />
<br />
“So you were talking about the lunch date?” Jordan said to return to the topic.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah,” replied Tabitha. “It’s not going to be a big thing. Just to see how well we get along before going further.”<br />
<br />
“May I see what he looks like?”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing.” Tabitha reached into her purse to pull out a smartphone. After a few taps, she pulled up the dating app with Trevor’s profile picture on display. Jordan noted that the man in the photo looks like the typical handsome guy from an indie band, with pale skin, short brown hair, and black-rimmed glasses. He is also clean shaven with a square jawline.<br />
<br />
“Huh.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, nothing,” said Jordan. “I’m surprised you found a guy with breasts bigger than your own.” Looking at the photo, Jordan can see the static image slowly morph around the man’s chest as if he was watching an edit occur in real time. Within seconds, Trevor’s formerly clothed chest was now open with a V-neckline showing off his bosom with deep cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Well, uh…” Tabitha started. “I’m into breast men. What can I say?”<br />
<br />
“No need to feel embarrassed by that,” Jordan said. “If the date goes well, he might invite you to a night of tit-fucking since you have an eight-inch dick.” Jordan felt the denim material beneath him grow warm and push him up where he sat as something solid grew into existence.<br />
<br />
“Y-you think so?”<br />
<br />
“For sure,” replied Jordan. “He would be a fool to pass up on someone as big and strong as you.” Once again, Jordan felt himself rise where he sat, this time with the sound of stretching fabrics filling his ears. “You’re, what, seven-foot-eight?” Tabitha’s comparatively larger body surged outward in all directions, nearly launching Jordan off her lap. Her knees touched the seats in front of her before her growing legs pushed against them, bending them forward. Looking up, Tabitha’s broadening frame seemed to build up muscle as she grew. Her breasts, which were fully leaking milk and dampening her shirt, appeared perkier as her pectorals provided support for them. Once her growth subsided, Tabitha looked like an inner city amazon as swaths of her attire tore and shredded, revealing toned muscles.<br />
<br />
“When you put it like that, there’s no way I’ll go home disappointed!” Tabitha quickly and gently lifted Jordan to her lips and planted a giant’s kiss on his entire face. “I was indifferent before, but now I feel certain this will be worth the trip. Thank you!”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mention it,” Jordan said, wiping saliva from his face. “You can put me down, now.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing.” Tabitha lowered Jordan onto her lap, to which he noticed the bulge in her loins pulsed. “Ooh. We’re coming up on my stop.”<br />
<br />
“Carry me on your way out,” said Jordan. Tabitha nodded and gently lifted the small man once more before carefully moving her large form out from where she sat on the bus. While she was able to exit the bus, there was some issue getting through the doorway. Once on the sidewalk, Tabitha stood to her full height with Jordan in one hand. “You can put me down now.” In a single motion, the amazon lowered Jordan to the ground and just as swiftly returned to her upright posture. The two-foot man could no longer see Tabitha’s face past her shelf of breast.<br />
<br />
Tabitha shifted her stance to better look down, and said, “Well, I’m off.”<br />
<br />
“Enjoy your date,” Jordan said.<br />
<br />
“I sure will!” Tabitha turned and walked away, her hips swaying with each step.</p>
