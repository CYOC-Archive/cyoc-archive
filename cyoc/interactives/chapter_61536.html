<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty figured he'd killed enough time at the park, and should try and meet up with Jake.  He never remembered how <br />
long a soccer game lasted - he didn't play - but he was pretty sure his friend was finishing up soon.<br />
<br />
On the way over, he thought about the guy he'd just helped out on the basketball court.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big guy, huh?&quot;  Ty chuckled.  &quot;I could get used to people calling me that.  Maybe I can get Dustin to call me <br />
that in a few weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or a few days.&quot;  Ty rolled his eyes.  &quot;Jeez, how much do Mark and June want him to grow, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty wasn't sure, but he figured he was actually about average height now for a 15-year-old.  His 'normal <br />
growth' wish was working nice and slow - as it should - and had shot him up about an inch, but on top of that <br />
two inches he'd just given himself that morning he could easily see the difference.  The world already <br />
looked....smaller, somehow.  Like things were lower than they used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things like Dustin's fat head.&quot;  Ty laughed evilly as he strolled past the first few soccer fields, trying to <br />
get used to his longer stride.<br />
<br />
A loud whistle stopped him in his tracks.  Looking over, he saw the little league soccer teams practicing.  <br />
Twelve year old kids were running in place as the coach flipped a number on the scoreboard.  It looked like <br />
the yellow team was killing the red.  And Ty thought he saw why.<br />
<br />
The Red team's goalie was tiny.  Really tiny.  Standing in front of that huge goal made him look even smaller.  <br />
There was just no way he could protect all of it.  Ty watched, and winced, as the kid dove to the side and ate <br />
dirt trying to reach another shot.  He was really giving it his all, losing sweat and blood for his team.  And <br />
tears, too, Ty saw.  Well, that wouldn't do at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that kid would become the best goalie someone his age could be.&quot;  Ty said firmly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the boy in the red shirt got an odd, startled expression on his face.  As Ty watched, he started <br />
bouncing up and down of the toes of his feet.  Every time he bounced, his calf and thigh muscles flexed, but <br />
they never seemed to shrink all the way back.<br />
<br />
Three bounces, and his leg muscles were actually visible.<br />
<br />
Seven, and now they actually looked round, jutting out behind his legs.<br />
<br />
Ten, and the boy stopped bouncing, with legs that probably shouldn't have existed on a kid who wasn't doing <br />
light weight lifting.  But things didn't stop there.<br />
<br />
Flinging his arms out to the side, the kid watched, wide-eyed, as his hands seemed to move further away.  He <br />
was too distracted to notice the same thing Ty himself had; that odd sensation that everything was suddenly <br />
getting lower.<br />
<br />
Ty watched as his arms and legs stretched out, inch by inch, giving him better maneuverability and a wider <br />
reach.  Finally, the boy's hands swelled up to half again their previous size, his fingers stretching out long <br />
as they splayed open.<br />
<br />
He now looked like he was a serious junior athlete, who was about to start his teenage growth spurt.  Slighly-<br />
too-big hands and feet, a bit of muscle, and a good reach for a twelve-year old.  Ty noticed the kid wince a <br />
bit and look down at his shoes.  Figuring it out - and sympathizing with the feeling - he quickly wished for <br />
his clothes to fit right.<br />
<br />
The next goal wasn't even close.  The wish seemed to have given the kid major soccer skills, too.  Barely <br />
moving from the center of the goal, he casually scooped up the soccer ball and swung it around back into play.  <br />
The whole movement flowed smoothly, effortlessly.  It was almost like watching a big cat pounce.  All of the <br />
red players cheered.<br />
<br />
Ty nodded with satisfaction.  Another good deed done.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Startled, Ty looked away from the game (which was now one sided the OTHER way) and saw Jake had finished <br />
practice and found him.  Grinning, Ty ran over and slapped his friend on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man.  I wanted to say thanks again for the present; and I was thinking maybe we could both head to the <br />
mall so I could use it.  Nothing better for my birthday than a massive video game marathon with my best <br />
friend!&quot;  Ty slung an arm over Jakes shoulder and playfully jostled his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;  Jake laughed.  &quot;That sounds like fun!  But cut that crap out, Ty.&quot; Jake whipped his hand up to the <br />
top of Ty's head to shove him away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot;  Jake exclaimed, backing up and looking Ty up and down.  &quot;Ty, are you taller?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ty asked, blinking.  &quot;Oh, uh, yeah.  I think I might have grown a bit.&quot; (A bit like three inches)<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up.&quot;  Jake ordered, moving closer and floating his hand over their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're as tall as I am!&quot;  Jake's mouth dropped open.  &quot;I just saw you this morning, why didn't I notice <br />
that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you were distracted by pizza?&quot;  Ty suggested.  He shrugged.  &quot;Seriously, it's no big deal.  I was <br />
probably due for a growth spurt anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you've been the same size since what, sixth grade?  I always had you pegged for a late bloomer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why'd you think that?  I don't know who my parents are; maybe I was just short.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah.&quot; Jake waved his hand.  &quot;My dad always told me boys grow from the outside in.  And you've had those tiny <br />
feet since I met you; I figured if they weren't getting bigger yet, neither were you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked down and whistled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're probably not done yet, either.  Are those the biggest sandals you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked down, surprised.  The strap was still comfortable, but both his heels AND this toes past the first <br />
knuckle were over the edges.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if MY shoes are quite that size.&quot;  Jake commented.  &quot;Crap.  That means you're probably going to <br />
be taller than me soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty ducked down as Jake gave him a hard noogie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's go, big guy.  The mall sounds fun, and I think you could use some new shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
'There's that big guy thing again.' Ty thought.  He grinned.<br />
<br />
'I definitely could get used to that.'</p>
