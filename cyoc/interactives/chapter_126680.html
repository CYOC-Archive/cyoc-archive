<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa awoke first but feeling what she had so enjoyed as still up, inside her, she thought to lie there and appreciate for a while more what felt to her as the best she had felt in years. Her small moves to help adjust the bloated plump cock held inside her vagina was enough to stir Jeff in his goat buck embodiment to stir and awaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa-haa...,&quot; Jeff moaned as best his muzzle would let him to muster forth a goat-like moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning to you Jeffrey, I trust that our first night being joined and together was as enjoyable for, you as you did so well to thrill me.&quot; She said, she with her name being Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bah...,&quot; Moaned Jeff, he lying still with his body stretched long, his hind legs and goat feet about the same. He moved just a little, feeling from his bloated, was still embedded Goat&#39;s cock, that he did realize was near to sheath deep inside his master and owner. As he moved the sensations felt from his stuffed cock caused it to become quickly aroused. As the two lovers were lying each on their sides, she facing Jeff, and his body facing her, had his muzzle lying with his chin atop her forehead. Jeff gawked with his right eye to peer down the length of his goat torso to see how he was as he felt it, with his belly sheath fur mingled with her pubic bush.<br />
<br />
As his cock stiffened again, it plumped in a fuller manner, giving both her and Jeff the sense of feeling stuffed inside as surrounding an inserted male member. She, Melissa did the first move as she reached a leg over her mating lover and rose to sitting astraddle with her groin on top of his belly mounted sheath. She then with a purpose did raise her pelvis and rump, as then compressing downward, smushing the erect and bloated buck goat cock, sending it to delve ever deeper; to where the pointed tip did peek inside her womb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa..., baa,&quot; Jeff moaned, as the wild and rank fun memories of the previous night were still a vivid memory. &quot;BAA, BAA, bah...,&quot; Jeff screamed, as if something that had slid deep in his mind and memory suddenly surfaced. He began to struggle, flagging his forelegs and sharp cloven hooves at his mistress master. He wanted up, as Jeff felt a dire sense of forlorn feelings and a reason in his mind to cause him to feel depressed. <br />
<br />
Melissa was taken off guard by the sudden thrashing of forelegs and hoofs. She needed to roll off as let his erect cock slide out of her aroused femininity. &quot;What is wrong Jeffrey,&quot; Melissa yelped, she free to move did scramble to the far side of her big bed.<br />
<br />
After the lusty woman was off from her sitting astraddle his goat self, Jeff was a scramble of legs to roll over and when standing, he with his cock out the sheath and still erect, he did jump down onto the bedroom floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAA, baa, baa, baa-nah,&quot; Jeff bleating as screamed.  He stood there swaying his head as he stood eying her his Master and Mistress.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what is it Jeffrey, the way you act is like a male showing signs of aggression and depression, as symptoms of a drastic mood swing. What are you feeling, is it a goat buck off seasonal disorder?&quot; Melissa asked, as Jeff began to walk in circles, though not chasing his tail, but acting as a disturbed male animal trying hard to decide his next move.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa, BAA, BAA..., baa-nah, naa, naa,&quot; Jeff bleating, he contorting his muzzle was struggling to do as speak more than a singular bland tone cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, are you trying to speak, to use your lips and tongue to enunciate words? Well, I think your speaking much more than to bleat is unlikely.&quot; Melissa said, but Jeff acted as if he had an adamant idea about him and her being as lovers.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAA, naa, naa, noo...,&quot; Jeff said, as using his narrow lips he worked them to form the word &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You spoke a real word, Jeff you spoke!&quot; Melissa said, as she scooter her naked self across her bed to sit Indian style on the bedside.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there trying to remember exactly how he formed the word he just had said. A sudden whiff of a rank musky scent turned his full attention to his Mistress. Jeff the goat swung his head around and he cocking his head did gawk at where he knew the smell had originated. Jeff took a half stride step forward, and ducking his head he brought his muzzle in alignment with her weeping pussy. Jeff was a buck goat first and a human male a distant second. He moved toward the alluring smell and with his tongue he began to give short, quick, lapping lickes at her sticky bush. It took but four licks and Jeff moved closer, his tongue then stretching to delve inside her sex to lick as clean her like he would at times tend to cleaning his goat&#39;s body, legs, and cock.<br />
<br />
Melissa just sat still and enjoyed the lurid attentions of her buck lover. She uncrossed her legs and spread them far apart, allowing Jeff a greater ease as to pressing his muzzle inside her pussy, as his tongue lapped at her insides.<br />
<br />
Sudden like, Jeff jerked his head back and continued licking his muzzle as he would do after having eaten a bowl of grain kernels.<br />
<br />
&quot;What now?&quot; Melissa asked of her beastly lover.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head in a violent manner, as moaning forth a bleated cry, he turned his whole self and began to walk out of her bedroom. Seemingly in a moping sort of mental depression, the big buck goat strolled along the outer hallway, as through the dining room, through the kitchen, and he pushing open the service door leading to the out-of-doors, Jeff continued to walk toward the pasture gate.  <br />
<br />
&quot;JEFFREY,&quot; Melissa called to her buck friend. She was still butt naked when she exited her house and ran after her goat lover.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is it, oh, oh..., some learned idea of morality, moral as religious teaching did surface and are now bothering you! Can I as to imagine this, you now being a buck goat, you having sad thoughts and moral concerns about you an animal, and me a person having spent a wild night enjoying our sexuality?  If you could ask, then yes I am a practicing zoophile, I like buck goats. However, the goats I let sleep with me were born as human and became by odd means as changed bodily into the forms of animal. They like you are or were then still enough of a human to own a personality. I love how you make me feel, you have a talent, though your passions are pent inside a furry form, you have a mind and that makes you different from me mating with a common born animal. <br />
<br />
Do you understand me? You retained your mind, your intellect, you have wits and sadly still have morals. It is by becoming a buck goat that having moral ideals is purely silly. You might recall that when you first entered the pasture the doe goats surrounded you, and you then mated with more than a dozen female animals. So then, if you mated with born doe goats, does that make you a zoophile too, I think not, as you are physically a buck goat, a herd sire!<br />
<br />
Sex and mating of doe goats will, with time wear your human mentality down to the whole of your being a buck goat, will be completely as an ignorant male goat; your link to humanity as gone, erased forever.&quot; She said, she his Master and Mistress, dear Melissa, thought Jeff did as then not know her as other than being his owner.</p>
