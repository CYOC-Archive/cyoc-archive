<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen apprehensively took a step toward Dylan. He continued to sit quietly, so Karen sat beside him on the bed, as close as she could get. She tried to console him. &quot;Look, it&#39;s not all bad. It&#39;s still you.&quot; All Dylan could think of was his date with Cindy. &quot;Cindy knows. She found out. I thought we were finally going to be able to do it tonight, but instead she saw this&quot; - Dylan gestured vaguely to his crotch - &quot;and just spent the night humiliating me&quot;. &quot;I know&quot;, Karen said with sympathy, &quot;I saw the picture&quot;. Right, the picture Cindy had taken. Even Karen saw that? Just who did Cindy send it to?<br />
<br />
&quot;So you didn&#39;t even get to do it with her, huh? I thought for sure you guys already had&quot;. Karen stopped thoughtfully for a moment, then she finally couldn&#39;t help asking. &quot;Have you ever done it?&quot; Dylan shook his head. He had never been embarrassed about being a virgin until now. He had a girlfriend, and he knew they were working up to it. There was a process involved. But after last night, and knowing the knew pea shooter he was packing, Dylan felt the full force of the humiliation. He would probably never get to do it now. Karen put a hand on Dylan&#39;s thigh. &quot;Awh, you will. I&#39;m sure you will. You&#39;re a great guy, any girl would be lucky to do it with you&quot;. She was lying of course, but after losing the medallion Karen felt responsible for Dylan&#39;s new fate. &quot;You didn&#39;t see the way Cindy reacted&quot; Dylan answered. &quot;It&#39;s how every girl will react, you don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m a girl.&quot; Karen responded mechanically, feeling almost offended even though she knew he was right. Then a mischievous smile slowly grew on Karen&#39;s face. Her hand gripped his thigh ever so slightly tighter, and she leaned in. &quot;Why don&#39;t I show you what you&#39;re in for with that great personality of yours&quot;. Dylan was dumbfounded, everything was turning so quickly. He thought maybe Karen was just fucking with him, like this was all part of an even more elaborate prank. Was Cindy in the closet waiting to jump out and continue the humiliation? Under his panties, Dylan felt a tiny stiffness - he didn&#39;t know whether it was Karen coming on to him or the thought of Cindy humiliating him that was turning him on, but there could be no doubt that he was rock hard - or at least pebble hard.<br />
<br />
Karen unzipped Dylan&#39;s jeans, she couldn&#39;t help laughing when she saw he was still wearing her panties, and the stain on them. But she played it off like Dylan was in on the joke, and just said &quot;Cute.&quot; She pulled the panties off him and it took all of her effort not to laugh again when she saw Dylan&#39;s baby boner. She came in close and breathed on it, then gave the head a little kiss. Even this was almost too much for Dylan, but he held on, the pressure feeling like it could overwhelm him and explode out at any moment. Karen stood up and began to strip, first her shirt, then her pants and socks, a deftly practiced routine that left her with nothing but her bra and panties. Leaving the rest to the imagination, she sat on Dylan&#39;s lap and planted a kiss on his lips, and then a deeper one. She reached down between his legs. Knowing that two fingers would be all it takes, she gave his little member a gentle tug between her forefinger and thumb, and then another. Two, that&#39;s all it took. Dylan had been trying with all his might, sitting on the edge the entire time, he almost lost control when she took off her shirt, and now this was too much. His entire body tightened up, he frantically kissed her back, and he spurted into her hands, his little penis softening between her fingers. She gave the exhausted little worm a couple more gentle rubs but it was entirely spent. It&#39;s a good thing they were kissing because it was the only thing that held back her laughter. She pulled back and smiled at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;That might have been a bit too much, huh?&quot; Dylan looked away embarrassed, Karen thought everything about this was adorable. &quot;Why don&#39;t you get dressed, we can try again tonight.&quot; Karen winked at him. Dylan gathered his clothes, then left the room. Somehow, despite everything, he was still a virgin. Will he ever get a chance like that again? He went to his room, and began to gather his clothes to do a load of laundry - anything to finally get out of these panties.<br />
<br />
Back in Karen&#39;s room, she was lying on her bed thinking of everything that had happened. Almost without noticing, her hand had slipped down between her legs and began gently feeling around. Sliding her finger between her lips, she saw the effect the encounter had had on her. She was wet. Really wet. Her fingers continued to feel herself, no urgency. There was time to digest it all. She had expected a quick disappointing round of sex to help restore Dylan&#39;s confidence, but somehow what happened had been... better? The more she thought about it, the more turned on she became. Dylan being ashamed of his baby dick - a little jolt of electricity shot through her. Dylan unable to contain himself after she barely tugged on his little boner twice - another jolt of electricity. She was really going to town on herself now. Dylan is still a virgin, Dylan had never had sex and no girl will ever want to have sex with his tiny (electricity), hairless (electricity), one-inch premature-ejaculating little, teeny weeny, itty-bitty, microscopic baby penis. The words ringing in her head brought her to a powerful climax, she opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling. She had never seen this side of herself before. She told Dylan they would try again this evening with the full intent of skipping the foreplay and getting right down to business, but maybe now she had a better idea.</p>
