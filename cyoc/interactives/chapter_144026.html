<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“James,” my mother said, looking at me curiously, “You seem..different.” <br />
<br />
“I suppose I do,” I replied. I could feel my wolf aspect trying to reassert itself again. Inwardly, it was reminding me that I was strong and she was weak. I straightened my back slightly, adapting a slightly more dominant posture than I had before.<br />
<br />
“He changed, Jules,” Cathy said. “A short while before you called..he changed. And he forced me to change. No full moon..no nothing. Just sheer force of will. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like it before. He&#39;s beyond the most powerful werewolf I&#39;ve ever seen, and I honestly wonder if it&#39;s only going to get stronger once he sees the full moon in two nights.”<br />
<br />
My mother looked back at me again, that sad expression on her face. “He&#39;s not my son any longer, is he?”<br />
<br />
“Mom, no..of course I&#39;m still your son. I&#39;m just..” I struggled to avoid saying the only word that came to mind, but the wolf aspect seemed to almost force me to say it, “I&#39;m better.” I could feel my wolf surfacing again. My heart rate was speeding up. Cathy looked at me in shock as her nostrils flared, seeming to catch the pheromones that I had unconsciously started to produce.<br />
<br />
“It just feels like..I&#39;m losing the only family I have,” my mother said. <br />
<br />
“We&#39;ll always be family, mom,” I said, trying to concentrate on the fact this was my mother. The wolf aspect didn&#39;t care. To it, she was just a woman, one who craved the change and simply couldn&#39;t admit it. “Even moreso if you join the pack.”<br />
<br />
“JAMES!” Cathy said in shock, only to chew her lip in nervous contemplation. It was obvious that the idea appealed to her, even if she couldn&#39;t believe I said it. (To be fair, even I wasn&#39;t sure that I could believe I said it.)<br />
<br />
My mother looked at Cathy and then back to me. “I...” she said in a hesitant voice. “I often wonder if I made the right choice. Back years ago, I mean.”<br />
<br />
My animal aspect surged to the forefront of my consciousness. I could feel the dominant aura radiating off of me. It overwhelmed me, pushing my own human inhibitions aside, though it was just as much me simply ceding control. I liked surrendering to that side. It felt natural and right.  “You can make that choice again,” I said. I walked over to Cathy, who was in nothing more than a pair of sleep  pants and loose fitting t-shirt. I knew the effect it would have on her, and Cathy moaned softly, rubbing her ass against the crotch of my shorts. She heated up against me and the room started to grow thick with pheromones.<br />
<br />
“I...” my mother stammered. Her eyes were wide; all her attention focused on Cathy. I could hear my mother&#39;s heartbeat and smell her arousal. It neither bothered nor turned me on; the wolf aspect knew that I still held some reservations about it. Cathy&#39;s scent, closer, stronger, and full of the wolf, dominated my attention. It smelled better. This other scent was just a human. And this encounter wasn&#39;t about me or for me..it was for Cathy. “I..miss you, Cathy..” she said. “And..I miss Fang. I miss US..”<br />
<br />
Inwardly, I was satisfied. Somehow, instinctively, I knew that with enough presence, I could break my mother&#39;s inhibition toward admitting what she had denied for so long. I could feel it withdrawing from my consciousness again. That was what it had wanted; not to fuck my mother, but to make the two most important women in my life happy.  I had the realization that THIS was what being an alpha meant. Yes, the spoils of my dominance would be mine, but a TRUE alpha cared about his pack, and though Cathy and I were only the start of a pack, my mother was an almost necessary addition for both our wolves&#39; happiness as well as our human sides.<br />
<br />
Cathy pulled away from me and planted a hard kiss on my mom, who didn&#39;t resist in the slightest. “M-Missed you too,” she said after she broke the kiss. There was a content silence between us all; truthfully it was like I wasn&#39;t even there.<br />
<br />
“Does it hurt?” my mother said quietly, after a time. “Being turned?”<br />
<br />
“It only stung for a second,” I answered.<br />
<br />
“And the incubation?”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s over before you know it.”<br />
<br />
“And..if you turn me tonight,” she asked, looking at Cathy. “Will I change in the moonlight with you, two days from now?”<br />
<br />
“Probably not that first night..just due to how long the incubation itself takes. Though maybe. Not entirely sure, really. James has proven there&#39;s exceptions. Definitely when the moon&#39;s at its peak, the second night of the three, though.” Cathy responded with a smile. She was eager.<br />
<br />
“I think I&#39;m going to give you two some privacy,” I told them quietly.  They both got up, with Cathy giving me another deep kiss and resting her forehead on mine. “Thank you..thank you so much, my alpha.” It was a quiet affirmation of multiple things, including her continued submission.<br />
<br />
My mother, while not giving me a deep kiss (which still would feel weird right now, I realized) gave me a tight hug. “Big changes..” she said quietly. There was a hint of sadness in her voice again. “No pun intended.” She gave a sad smile. It dawned on me that after tonight, our relationship would fundamentally change, and I realized that&#39;s probably what she&#39;d figured out as well. “No matter what,” she whispered in my ear as she gave me a second, longer hug, “You&#39;ll always be my baby boy. I love you.”<br />
<br />
The weight of it all hit me for a second, and I choked up for a moment. “Love you too mom..” I slowly pulled away and opened the door. “Goodbye..” I said, knowing that I was consciously saying farewell to the woman who&#39;d raised me. In a couple of days, she&#39;d be different. Most of me knew that she would be better, just like I was now, but still, it was an emotionally difficult realization.<br />
<br />
As I was closing the door, I heard my mother say to Cathy, “I&#39;ll find a picture of the moon for you. I want to make love to you as you change.” I smiled instinctively. Difficult as it was, I felt certain she&#39;d made the right  choice.</p>
