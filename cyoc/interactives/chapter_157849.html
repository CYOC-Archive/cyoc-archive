<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At recess, Jim’s new height gave him confidence he didn’t have before. He decides do something he didn’t dare doing before: go to the place the 11th and 12th graders hang out in.<br />
Walking through the area, he saw how the older students were mostly shorter than him, with a handful taller than him. He didn’t like the thought of the latter.<br />
He saw his step brother David standing up and went towards him.<br />
“Hey there Jim, what are you doing here?” David asked.<br />
“Just wanted to say hi to you. How was your night at Emma’s (his girlfriend) home?” Jim replied.<br />
“It was great” answered David.<br />
David then remembered something, and said “Jim, I know you are very excited about reaching my height, but I would like to meet remind you that you are still not the tallest. I want you to meet Brian. Can you wait a moment?”<br />
Jim remembered seeing Brian once when he visited David two years ago. He remembered that due to the fact that Brian dwarfed his tall step brother who was already over 6 feet tall back then and that he already had to bend when walking through doorframes, meaning that now he would be dwarfed himself, even at his new height.<br />
Not wanting to feel small once again, he said “No... I think I forgot something... I’ll be right back!” and quickly left.<br />
He was already very tall, and he had plenty of growth left, but he didn’t want to feel short ever again, near anyone. He wanted to tower over even abnormally tall people, to be the tallest person ever.<br />
He went to an empty area, grabbed his phone and wrote a massage to his step mom “Mom, can you remind me how tall you measured me yesterday?” He knew he was six and a half feet tall, but he needed it written down.<br />
She answered “I think it was 6’6” sweetheart”<br />
He got what he needed.<br />
Jim grabbed the balloon and said once again “Control my height with reality change” and blew up.<br />
The first blow raised him upwards, and the height in his mom’s massage changed to 6’11. He would’ve probably still felt short near Brian now and he didn’t want to stop.<br />
The second blow raised him even higher, and looking at his phone this time, he saw that it was changed to be one with a larger screen. This time, the massage said 7’6”. He didn’t know Brian’s current height, so he didn’t know what their difference will be.<br />
A third blow brought him to 8’2”. He would probably tower even over Brian now, but he wasn’t down yet.<br />
Looking down for a moment, Jim then thought that his planned height will make his junk look small in comparison, so he said “release” and let the balloon deflate for a bit to aid in his final blow for his height.<br />
He then said “Control my height and my penis size with reality change”, took a strong breath and blew at the balloon.<br />
He stopped as he saw his step mom’s massage said 9’0”, and said “release”. The phone he held had a very big screen now, but it still looked small for him.<br />
Looking around, everything looked even smaller, comically small even, and his underwear felt tight.<br />
Looking at his arm, Jim saw that it was far too skinny once again, and said “Control my muscle size with reality change” and blew it a little until it was still extremely skinny, but not too much. He thought that his long and skinny body will help emphasizing his height.<br />
He returned to the place of the older students and to his step brother, taking very little time in his titanic steps. Everyone he went by looked extremely tiny, and he himself attracted a lot of stares of the people surprised by a titan walking by.<br />
When he got to his step brother, David was now talking to a person who dwarfed him, who’s face was turned against Jim.<br />
Jim was amazed to see his step brother, who he was always used to be dwarfed by, not sure at eye level, but absolutely tiny. Even the taller person looked tiny.<br />
Seeing his step brother, David said “Hey Jim, thanks for coming back. Brian, remember how I said my little bro will dwarf you? Turn around” Jim noticed how this time, David teased Brian about a Jim’s height and not Jim about Brian’s height.<br />
Brian turned around saying “Yeah, yeah, sure..”, instinctively looking down as he was used to with everyone he knows, and then got surprised as he saw that he had to bend his neck upwards to look at the person, and then even more upwards...<br />
When his stare reached the top, he suddenly backed away for a moment with an even greater surprise as he saw that the face on the top of the towering body was youthful.<br />
During all that time, Jim watched that, his smile growing wide as he saw a person who is used to tower over everyone feel surprised to be absolutely dwarfed, and by a young kid.<br />
David then said “Meet my not so little step brother Jim. He was very short two years ago and then started growing at a rate that would put a weed to shame.” That told Jim story that explains his height in this new reality. “He was measured yesterday at 9 feet tall, meaning he became the tallest person ever very recently, at only 12 years old!”<br />
Brian stared in disbelief and amazing. He never saw a person taller than him ever since he grew past 7 feet, and right now his 18 year old self (he was a grade above David) was completely dwarfed by a 12 year old...<br />
Jim then asked Brian teasingly “You don’t look that short, how tall are you?”<br />
“I am seven foot four...” he said mumbling a bit. He couldn’t believe that a little kid called HIM, one of the tallest people in the world, SHORT, but he wasn’t able to deny the comparison...<br />
Jim enjoyed every moment of the encounter.<br />
He was absolutely towering, completely dwarfing even seven footers. It was absolutely amazing.<br />
The recess then ended, and all three had to return to their lessons.<br />
Brian felt a relief to not be near the towering kid anymore, and Jim was excited for the continuation of the day.</p>
