<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At your age you thought you were ready to accept most any discomfort just to earn this kind of money again. That wonderous figure which loomed so bright before you now has much different conotations.<br />
<br />
Here you are strapped to a operating table, injected with fluids created with the sole purpose of removing the person you are and bring to the world a revised self. Self, what was to be your self?<br />
<br />
Me I am me, but as the serum pulses through your veins the me is to take on a new me! Sudden thoughts of my Wife and Family and their thoughts of where I went to work, why I moved away, and why I don't call or write make me worry.<br />
<br />
Even as I lay there the change is happening to soft tissue parts first. A studdered speach begs to know how long this will take, yet now the men and or the Doctor don't even look at me. A sinking feeling hits as I lay tied in place, they're already considering me as a lessor' creature than they! As eyes strain to see their movements and worry racks my brain I'm jolted back to the fact of this fight for my humanity.<br />
<br />
Pain, eyes, teeth, spine, knuckles, all are on fire and I begin what will be a long time of screaming. <br />
<br />
Eyes clinch shut with sharp pains behind the sockets. Teeth pain as if being uprooted and yanked from their roots. Electric shocks pulse up and down the spine seeking ever new points for the pains to begin. Joints, my hands, knuckles ache, I wonder if the amount of money was worth being cast into this living Hell?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look at him he's in pain, FOOL, pain like that kills brain cells and he going to need all he's got to survive! SEDATE the man! Hurry, hurry, get him to sleep or I'll inject you, damn it!&quot; yells my savior, a Doctor with feeeeeeelllliiinnnggggs......as I drift off into peaceful slumber.<br />
<br />
Now the dreams come as they mix with the sounds of arguments between management and that dumb Doctor. I must hear the ruccuss but it is conferred to me as dreams of Ponydom. Throughts, dreams, memories of many years gone by when I owned a great roan American Shetland pony.<br />
<br />
Shiek Hamar Besar, I called him, a name from some book I read back in grade school. He was given to me by a great friend. My own pony, a stallion, bright, true to me as only a pony raised by it's owner can be a companion. I watched him enter the world and with his mother he grew tall and strong. Oh he had such spirit, such feelings of pride as he's strut about! Head held high he seemed to know who he was, as tail also held high when he's walk or run. He's was mine but in another way he was as I would have been, given the choice eion's ago.<br />
<br />
Deep in my slumber my thought turn back to the training of my pony. His hatred of the bit, then the saddle, but in time he accepted them. I felt he accepted those nasty things which made him bound into a sort of bondage. Yet my friendship must have meant something to him as he accepted all for me to ride him and us to play in the pasture.<br />
<br />
I got his goat when we played! He couldn't turn his long body as fast as I could change directions on two feet. He's snort and whinnie at me when we'd play a sort of pony tag. I'd win for the ability to corner him and catch him with short quick moves. Shiek would win as he took off at thirty mile per hour, leaving me laughing and sitting down in a cloud of dust. Once across the pasture he'd turn and stand head held high and whinnie for his success.<br />
<br />
Such fun we'd have and the other ponies would on occasion join in. I think too of that Spring when I'd call him. He'd look over his shoulder at me but stood his ground. The instinctive desire to procreate began to well up it's terrible head. I had to learn his desires for passion were all consuming. He had no real will but only learned patterns of life to fall back on. Now he was to learn his reason for being as he pranced and whinnied loud for those willing mares.<br />
<br />
Long hours after school and then later all day I'd watch him show off for his harem. Birds and bees come home to a young boy as he watches the animals do without shame what comes as part of nature. I stood there, sometimes within a few feet as Shiek rose up to cover the mare. He'd look down on me as if he was trying to show me how it was done. Still a friend, true and true, but now more a King than the pony I helped raise.<br />
<br />
I think back to me discribing his actions to my Father and the odd rejection he paid to me as if I was sounding off stupidly. Even as I pleaded in my own way to tell of Shiek's conquest it only seemed to anger Dad till he cuffed me across the mouth.<br />
<br />
A long conferance between Mother and Father as I sat on a kitchen chair like a bad boy. At last Mom came and sat down beside me and in what I considered the normal way to handle a situation I was told my days with 4-H were over. I'd become less of a son and was sounding off like a pervert! <br />
<br />
I asked teachers I knew if what had happened and the account of it was all so very bad. It was my science teacher Popps that sat me down and finally explained the reasons for the parential actions. He told me of morals in the society to which we live and how some people, my parents for some view sex in nature.<br />
<br />
Popps gave me quite the talk that warm summer afternoon. His care for me was not just as a growing mind but one for a boy who must become and live the life as a man. <br />
<br />
Years later when Popps had family troubles I was there to give help and a friendship which was heartfelt by him and me. I think of those times now as I know I'm sleeping my way to join Shiek.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH WOW!&quot; I hear myself say as the sounds of the room become quite. In that twilight sleep one doesn't know which is true or what is real. I must have heard someone exclaim my changed self or something but it was a statment which sent my thoughts to wander.<br />
<br />
The sight of Shiek' mounted over the back of Holly a stout and well rounded mare. I see the memory as if only inches away, his black flared, flack ended shaft slowly pressing the tender wet folds of Holly's vulva. As if suspended in time his shaft moves in slow motion to spread those black lips and peak inside the very pinkness of her body.<br />
<br />
Slowly, yet I know it happened very fast and with such thrust Holly about bolted away. Inch by wonderful inch of his massive staft entered deep into Holly's in heat body. As his shaft entered the bubbling juices which oiled his dry member helped guide him inside. A short step closer burried his penis deep until the sheath was in her opening.<br />
<br />
Now came the stallion ritual which Shiek seemed to find so overwhelming. In and pull back, in and pull back, his pelvis did the work. Thrust after thrust built to a creshendo of wild passion were if I'd really been that close I'd found myself kicked or bit.<br />
<br />
Shiek never took more than a few minutes when he enjoyed this time of conecting into his loves. I wondered then why he didn't stay inside and up top since he looked to be the power and prime enjoyer of those moments. Yet too Holly or any other of the mares stood there, head lowered in submission to the stud. I knew all too well that if Holly wasn't enjoying the moment with Shiek she's lashed out a kick and even casterated him. I think of Lonnie and his bad experiance with Rachel. He was a stallion of ten years old. An experianced lover of mares but on that bad day Rachel was not feeling all so much in need of love.<br />
<br />
As Lonnie stood high in the saddle and his thrusting pattern firming it's rythum Rachel decided it was over. A pair of hind legs came up in a jolt. Lonnie was knocked out of her and lifted into the air off his hoofs. Down he came, his slick member suddenly limp and then covered in sand. He screamed a terrible empained whinnie! All the ponies looked up from where they were at the horrible cry. <br />
<br />
Rachel just stepped away as if nothing happened and went directly to grazing. Poor Lonnie laid stretched out in the sandy dirt. His white eye showing the pain he was in at that moment. Heavy breathing slowly calmed as I hope so did his agony. It was an hour later before he lifted his head and then with shaky legs came to stand.<br />
<br />
I watched him turn a walk slowly back to the main corral. His long penis wagged back and forth with every step. He remained limp and long as he stood drinking by the trough in the corral. I remember walking near the fence and offering a handful of green grass. Pour Lonnie knew in his little mind that Summer was over and he was now less than what he once was.<br />
<br />
It was after that when Shiek took over the role of prime stallion and Lonnie stood off in a corner of the pasture. He'd watch but say nothing as his harem was taken from him by Shiek. Never did I see Lonnie fight with Shiek over the loss of his harem, but niether did Shiek be mean to Lonnie. It was like a mutual respect, I never really understood, till maybe now!<br />
<br />
Words again, heard as Doctors talk and examine the volunteer. Me I accepted the contract for this the lowering of self to primal ways of life. All so soon they would wake me a show me the new ways to walk, run, trot, canter, and live.<br />
<br />
Dreams of my years as a pony owner now come to mind. I see the 4-H shows and the pride Shiek had of himself. The memories of trips to other ranch or farms for stud service by Shiek. I remember my Father being disgusted with me for going to watch my stallion perform. Now I will be performing and Father long dead cannot stand by and exclaim his nasty attitude. Oh though how I wish this had happened back then and he had to watch me, made animal do as he found so dishonorable.<br />
<br />
I'd look over my shoulder and down onto the man he was as I stood humped over my preferred mate. He'd have to watch as that pony long penis thrust into the mare. I'd whinnie my passion as did Shiek' when he was deep in the pleasure of a salty mare, like Holly. True it would have been a delight to make him see what he found so distasting and I then and now look forward to the ritual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake, wake please Shetland Stud, are you ready to be a part of history? Wake, join the world of Shetland ponies, come wake, wake!&quot; calls the voice.<br />
<br />
One eye opens to a blurred vision of some man peering down at me.  The scent of straw about me and other smels which I quickly remember to be those of the stables.<br />
<br />
I lift my head as the sudden feel of powerful muscles and a strong body now surrounds the new me. I blink and cast my bearings as the sight of the Doctor of pain and a cute Nurse come into focus.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have made the grade, you are now a complete Shetland pony! Stay calm, don't try to get up just yet! Easy, easy!&quot; says the one man. <br />
<br />
Part of me is delighted to be as I am, and yet I don't like the words said to calm a dumb beast. A snuffle and soft whinnie escapes my thick lips. <br />
<br />
A tongue quickly runs it's course over slab teeth which fills most of my mouth. A chill sends a shiver down my body as the people jump back.<br />
Another whinne and all feel at ease as I roll on my back and begin to kick with glee the air.</p>
