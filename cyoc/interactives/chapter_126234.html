<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ugh, I&#39;m gettin&#39; so fat,&quot; groaned Shannon as she looked at her swelling belly. It was funny, as a normal horse, she would have seen a round belly as a sign of contentment. But being part human made her more open to human opinions and preferences. And she was quite aware that a sagging belly is considered unattractive.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just our growin&#39; child, that&#39;s all,&quot; said Shamus as he got Shannon a cup of hot tea. Their winter fur may have come in, but they did find the weather getting more nippy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just that,&quot; said Shannon, &quot;Sittin&#39; around all winter is gonna make me lose me shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be hard to get ye back in shape,&quot; said Shamus, rubbing his wife&#39;s round belly.<br />
<br />
Shannon gave a soft moan. &quot;Could ye rub me shoulders in a wee bit?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, love,&quot; said Shamus as he rubbed his wife, feeling the life growing inside her. He thought back fondly to their trip in Ireland that led to the conception of this foal.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After the International Animalia Convention was over, it was time for Shamus and Shannon to take a long-overdue honeymoon. And what better place but the Emerald Isle they were born on? It was pretty simple to take a flight overseas to Ireland, though getting a ride to Shamus&#39;s home village took a while. But as soon as they got there, they were given a very warm Irish welcome, with a local band and everything. After all, it wasn&#39;t every day that one of their own returns from America with a new wife. The fact that they were both horse Animalians didn&#39;t make much of a difference, though there was a lot of staring from the younger kids.<br />
<br />
One of the main parts of the celebration was the wedding. Of course, Shamus and Shannon had already married and it was rather early in their marriage to be renewing their vows, but they were about to deny their old countrymen the delight of a wedding. Especially since Father McConnell had known Shamus for many years and had been waiting for the day when he could perform his marriage rites. Shamus didn&#39;t have a tux with him, but such finery wasn&#39;t so necessary for village weddings. Everyone did say that Shannon looked lovely in her dress, though a couple of the older women did titter with disapproval. That might have been a bit of jealousy about how well Shannon filled out her dress though.<br />
<br />
And there was plenty of celebration afterwards. The Irish were a rowdy lot when they got excited and it wasn&#39;t entirely surprising that a few of the men wanted to swing with Shamus for a few rounds. But considering Shamus was so much stronger as a horse Animalian, it was definitely a bad idea to get in an actual fist fight with him. But there was something that allowed the villagers to see how strong Shamus&#39;s fists were now. A dummy packed tight with sand was set up in the square and the men cheered as Shamus punched the dummy with great vigor. The dummy had been made to look like a local politician that was not a favorite in these parts, but the features were kept vague enough so that no one could say who it was supposed to represent. Eventually, Shamus literally punched a hole in the dummy and knocked the stuffing out of it. He worked up a decent sweat and his knuckles were a little sore after that, but he was clearly stronger than anyone was willing to take on.<br />
<br />
And of course, there was also the Irish tradition of drinking. There were plenty of men who were wanting to see if they&#39;d be able to drink an Animalian under the table. Most Animalians don&#39;t like the taste of alcohol, but Shamus wasn&#39;t drinking for the taste. Shannon didn&#39;t really condoned this, but she let her husband had her fun. Since it would have been impractical for Shamus to draw to out-drink the other men one at a time, the contest was set up as an elimination competition. Everyone was to keep drinking from shot glasses until there was only one left conscious.<br />
<br />
The shot glasses piped up quite a bit and about every twentieth glass, they were removed so they can be refilled and so they don&#39;t get accidentally smashed. One by one, the competitors dropped off and were dragged off to where they can eventually recuperate. But Shamus remained in the running, even if he was becoming increasingly tipsy. Eventually, there were only a few drinkers left standing, so to speak. In addition to their drinking, they were carrying on a conversation in a language that can only be spoken or understood by the very inebriated. An example of the conversation between Shamus and one of the village men could be translated at this:<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Yer a bit strong horse, ain&#39;t ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are bigger, stronger horses back in America.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But yer still bigger and stronger than the horses we&#39;ve got here. Maybe ye should breed with our mares ta see if ye can make any good colts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that would be a bad idea. Even if the virus in me system doesn&#39;t convert the mares into Animalians, there&#39;s no tellin&#39; if me seed will be able ta grow within them. And how would we know if the foal will be healthy with its mixed genetics? Besides, I shouldn&#39;t be matin&#39; with dumb beasts, especially since I&#39;m married to me one true love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Willa slubbeta oh mibilin sergeretaro corsunnno ????????&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The conversation stopped at that point as Shamus&#39;s opponent was inebriated far past the point for even drunken talk. Only a few seconds later, he fell out of his chair. There weren&#39;t many left upright soon after and Shamus was declared the winner. But he was so drunk by that point, that he wasn&#39;t capable of walking anywhere. It took Shannon and two strong men to carry him to a bed.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The next morning, Shamus woke up with a groan, his head pounding like horses have been stomping on it. &quot;Ugh, did I get drunk or drunk?&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ye did. But at least ye were the last one ta fall over,&quot; said Shannon dryly.<br />
<br />
Shamus tried to sit up only to clutch his head and groan, &quot;Begorrah, I&#39;ll never get that far down ta the bottom of a bottle again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what they all say,&quot; said Shannon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean it, Shannon. If I ever drink again, it won&#39;t be ta this limit,&quot; said Shamus as he lied back down, &quot;Could ye be a good lass and me some ice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just lie down and rest,&quot; said Shannon, &quot;Yer brain and yer liver need as much recuperatin&#39; as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The rest of the honeymoon was a lot quieter. Shamus and Shannon spent a lot of time roaming the fields outside of the village. It was peaceful, green countryside, The horses that were kept there could tell something was different about Shamus and Shannon, but they made no objections. It was a pity neither Shamus nor Shannon could ride them, but they could still pet them at least, though they needed to make sure they didn&#39;t infect them by accident.<br />
<br />
After one such day of roaming, Shamus and Shannon went back to their rented cottage to relax. &quot;Hard ta believe ye used to be one of them horses,&quot; said Shamus.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a good life, for a horse,&quot; said Shannon, &quot;But I don&#39;t think I could go back ta bein&#39; like that. I&#39;d go mad with boredom before three days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ye don&#39;t have ta worry about that,&quot; said Shamus, &quot;Nobody will be usin&#39; ye ta breed horses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; said Shannon in a coy voice. Shamus raised an eyebrow as Shannon loosened her dress a bit. &quot;I know ye missed out on havin&#39; kids the first time around. I would be honored to bear yer foals. Besides, we are on our honeymoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take a lot of persuasion to take Shamus into the bedroom. Before long, they were both lying on the bed. Shannon moaned as Shamus kissed her neck and her nipples as he thrust eagerly into her. Of course, they&#39;ve had sex plenty of time since they&#39;ve become Animalians, but this time, Shannon was earnest about bearing Shamu&#39;s children. She was pushing back against Shamus almost more times than he was thrusting. Her rapid movement soon had them both neighing as they hit their orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye certainly are a frisky filly tonight,&quot; said Shamus, giving Shannon&#39;s breast a playful tweak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just really want ta give ye children,&quot; said Shannon as she felt Shamus slide inside her a bit, &quot;Do ye think it took?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s only one way ta be certain,&quot; said Shamus before plunging again.<br />
<br />
Shannon moaned as she felt the pleasure build up again. &quot;Don&#39;t stop...&quot; she moaned, &quot;Don&#39;t stop until I&#39;m full with your foal.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Well, she definitely got what she asked for. Shannon reflected that as she looked at her gravid stomach. She was thrilled to be pregnant, but the long wait and the effects on her body were making her impatient. Thankfully, she only had to carry the baby for only nine months instead of eleven. But even so, the day of her foal&#39;s birth couldn&#39;t come soon enough.</p>
