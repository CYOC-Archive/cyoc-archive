<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Graham mused sleepily; the change had left him tired, despite the ‘feeding’ by his WereBear benefactors.  His dark black beard and body hair didn’t seem to match the remembered visions of his chocolate brown Kodiak fur.  His sleepy mind turned it over as he cat napped, waiting for the two who had changed him to wake.  His mind provided the answer from the vaults of stored research he’d done on WereBears.<br />
<br />
Graham was gifted with an extraordinary memory, had he not been obsessed with becoming a Bear Shifter, he would have made an excellent professor or research scientist.  <br />
<br />
He could clearly see the passage from a 1969 research paper by Reginald Quinn, PHD at Harvard Med School.  <br />
<br />
“…Though human hair color in a full eighty-five percent of the research subjects changed to somewhat match the color of the therianthrope, (one of the subjects I interviewed was now a natural red head and had formerly been ash blond.  I was told the hair color change hand come after becoming a tiger therianthrope.  The subject did not have the tiger’s orange and black colored stripes in human form in any way) change of human hair color to that of the animal form is not a given.  It was discovered that ten percent of the subjects retained their human hair coloring and the remaining five percent changed to a different color from both their animal form and previous human form.  Once extraordinary subject had completely white hair; the color before transformation had been black and the subject’s lion form was of course tawny as is appropriate to leonine therianthropes.  Genetic testing suggests that a random mutation…”<br />
<br />
Graham reasoned that the black hair he’d had since childhood was expressed on a gene that was not changed by becoming a Kodiak Grizzly.<br />
<br />
Graham drifted in and out and about an hour later, the sun lower in the sky, he was woken by a hand on his hairy shoulder, gently shaking him.<br />
<br />
He looked up into the face of the yard’s owner who was kneeling at the bedside; the other massive man was sitting on the bed looking at him.<br />
<br />
“Hey buddy, wake up.”  The owner said.<br />
<br />
Graham stretched and yawned luxuriously and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Hello.”  Graham said with a deep bass voice in a friendly way.<br />
<br />
“Hello?  Who are you?!” the man at the edge of the bed asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
“My name’s Graham Millian, who are you?”  Graham said.<br />
<br />
“Who am I?  I’m the guy who is gonna kick your butt if you don’t get to the point, Graham.  What the Hell are you doing here and what was that ‘Feed me Papa, I’m yours’ note about?”  The larger of the two men said. <br />
<br />
“What note and there’s no need to be mean.”  Graham said.<br />
<br />
Tim interrupted, “Graham, we found the canvas bags by the door with all the stuff from the house in it.  There were lock picks and various other ‘second storey’ paraphernalia in the backpack.  You came here to rob us.  Now we want to know why.”<br />
<br />
Graham looked Tim square in the eye and told him the absolute truth, “Yes, I came to rob you but I didn’t and I don’t need to rob anyone ever again.”  Graham said, his face had a wide smile and his heart was almost bursting with glee.<br />
<br />
“Ya know we could turn you over to the police; attempted robbery is a crime.”  Kelvin said.<br />
<br />
“Are you always this grumpy after sex, Mr. Bear?  I mean, hours of fucking me should have sweetened your mood a little.”  Graham said with a slight smirk.<br />
<br />
Kelvin ignored that and said, “Why shouldn’t we turn you over, right now?”<br />
<br />
Something tickled at the back of Tim’s mind and an idea began forming.<br />
<br />
Graham smiled and replied to Kelvin, “Because I’m a new man or should I say Bear.  The whole reason I was robbing people was to get enough money together to go to Europe and have the new technomagical procedure to change me into a Werebear, now that I am, I no longer need that.  I can live out my life contentedly.”<br />
<br />
“You willin’ to do that behind bars?”  Kelvin said with an evil grin.<br />
<br />
“You’d be throwing a rehabilitated man into a Hellish place if you did.  There’s no need to do that, is there?  Look, last night with you two was the happiest night of my entire life.  How can you fuck me, with us all enjoying it that much, and then turn me over to the cops?”  Graham asked and Kelvin was about to retort when Tim interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Look, Graham, do you live around here?”  Tim asked.<br />
<br />
“Not really… I just got kicked out of my rat hole of an apartment for not paying the rent.”  Graham said.  “Savin’ for that procedure...”<br />
<br />
“You got family?”  Tim asked.<br />
<br />
“I do; three states away but my dad disowned me; said I was a as a sick freak.  He told me to go join the circus as ‘the Bear Sucking Geek’.  He said I was dead to him.” Graham said with a calm and unemotional face, but Tim could feel the pain and rejection within the burglar.<br />
<br />
“That’s harsh.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“Look, I’m not looking for sympathy.  You asked about family and it’s a sore spot is all.”  Graham said.<br />
<br />
“Alright, look I’ve got an idea.  You’re now a very big strong man, how about I put you to work?”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“Are you serious Tim?”  Kelvin asked, “He came to rob you?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but I didn’t.  Look, I’ve changed; literally.  Body, mind and soul I’m a different man since you two changed me last night.”  Graham said, pleadingly.<br />
<br />
“I think I can trust him, Kelvin.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“It’s nice to meet you, KELVIN.” Graham said and smiled.  “Look, you don’t seem to understand.  You two are WereBears, I worship the very ground you walk on.  If I’d known you were WereBears I would never have tried to rob you, but then, if I hadn’t I wouldn’t have been changed by you.  I’m eternally in your debt.  I feel a bond with you, probably much deeper than you could know.  I’ll work for free to help you, you’ve given me all I’ve ever wanted in my whole life since I was about nine when I saw the circus strongman who was a WereBear.  I’m grateful beyond measure.  Please, don’t call the cops.  I’ll work hard for the both of you, I promise.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t know how pathetic I was, how I loathed what I was before.  How I wished for what you are and it seemed I could never have it.  How I longed to be mated to a big burly bear like either of you.  But my longing is over and I have you to thank for all I am now.”  Graham said and the sincerity in his bass voice was that of the nine year old boy.  <br />
<br />
It was a promise Tim knew Graham would keep.<br />
<br />
Tim looked into Kelvin’s eyes and Kelvin’s heart melted.  Tim obviously had a soft spot for ‘abused strays’.<br />
<br />
“You can work for me the part-time.”  Tim said.  “Further, you can stay here in the house; room and board as part of your pay.”  Tim looked into Kelvin’s eyes and pleaded silently. <br />
<br />
“Alright…you can work for me too.”  Kelvin said, “Part time doin’ grunt work.  Lifting stuff and cleanin’ up.”<br />
<br />
“But if you cross either one of us, we’re turnin’ you in with no second chance.  You’ve blown all chances…”  Tim smiled and added, “For now.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin rolled his eyes, then he laughed and said, “Well, some of the bros I ride with have been on the wrong side of the law and they’ve put themselves together.  I suppose someone had to give them a break at one point or another.”<br />
<br />
Graham offered his hand to Kelvin and said, “I won’t disappoint you.”<br />
<br />
Kelvin took his hand and as soon as he did so, Graham, being a much larger man pulled Kelvin onto the bed and put him on his back.  In a flash, Graham was sucking Kelvin’s cock.  Kelvin put up a mock struggle then he gave into the pleasure as Graham shifted form.  Kelvin’s eyes closed in bliss and his breathing became ragged.<br />
<br />
Tim raised the tail of the now dark chocolate brown Kodiak and slipped his cock into Graham’s hole.<br />
<br />
They sealed their promises with sex.<br />
<br />
*************<br />
<br />
The next day it was business as usual at the yard.  Graham had some clothes delivered thanks to Tim.  Tim had to call a special big and tall store to get clothes for Graham and he told Graham he’d be working the cost off until he got paid.<br />
<br />
Kelvin had had two days off from work and the paperwork had stacked up.  His foreman was not happy that he’d ignored his cell phone messages, but what could he do?  Kelvin was the boss.<br />
<br />
The weeks went with Graham working for Kelvin on construction sites cleaning stuff up and moving things around and Graham was a very big help around the yard too.  Richard raised an eyebrow once or twice, but didn’t say anything.  Tim’s sex life was his own business, after all.<br />
<br />
The weekends came and went and Kelvin was back at the yard for the most of them and occasionally he’d drop by after work and stay until early morning.  The dogs didn’t even bark at him anymore.<br />
<br />
Tim had spent a couple hours each weekend with the teaching crystal and was showing Graham how to use it.  Of course, Graham looked through the files for anything about WereBears.<br />
<br />
It was a Saturday; about two months after Tal’s box had changed Tim and Kelvin.  Tim sat at the kitchen table having a beer with Graham, flipping through the latest US Bears magazine.  By the time Kelvin got to the yard at 2 pm on Saturday, the two had had enough for the day with the crystal and had been relaxing for about an hour.  Graham was giving Tim a back massage and going over some yard business.  Graham’s former occupation gave him some real insights into improving security.  He worked Tim’s stiff neck muscles and Tim’s boner was pushing on the crotch of his overalls.<br />
<br />
“I could massage something else if you’d like, Papa.”  Graham said as he looked at the tented lump at Tim’s groin.<br />
<br />
“Not now Graham, we don’t have time.  Kelvin’s going to be over soon and we’ve all got to go out.”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“There’s no time for a…”  Graham began and Tim finished, “…A quickie?  Nope, sorry.  We can come back after the meeting and bar crawl and the three of us can have a nice long night and a glorious morning to late morning, how’s that?”  Tim said.<br />
<br />
“Good enough for me!”  Graham said and continued to massage Tim’s neck and back.<br />
<br />
Kelvin pulled up to the place thinking about his two ‘mates’.  He’d begun to think of them as such.  How lucky could a Bear get?  He had two men who cared as much for him as he did for them.  He opened the screen door and was greeted by the guys in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Kelvin over the last two months was impressed with Graham’s enthusiasm for labor.  He seemed to really like working with his muscles.  Graham cheerfully accepted back breaking digging jobs that you couldn’t use a backhoe for.  He lifted things and cleaned up with no complaints and there was a smile permanently plastered on his face.  The tough work seemed to give Graham a hard on and after work he practically begged Kelvin to fuck him and Kelvin ALWAYS gave the big bear a reach around as he did so.  Soon, Graham was fucking Kelvin as much as Tim fucked him; the difference was Graham called him and Tim both ‘Papa’.  Kelvin thought it was odd at first, but realized that it was important to Graham so he didn’t mind and in fact he kind of liked being called Papa.<br />
<br />
Tim saw that Graham had the same enthusiasm for working in the yard as he did on construction sites.  The opinion of Graham from the others he worked with was that he was a hard and honest worker who never complained and never had a bad word for anyone.  Generally, speaking, he was a great guy.<br />
<br />
Kelvin sat down at the table and opened a beer.  “I’ve got a surprise for you two.”  He took his shirt off and showed off the line work for the new version of ‘Bjorn’ on his back.  There wasn’t just one bear, there were two; one shorter and one tall.  The taller one was standing behind the other with his paw draped over the smaller one’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“So that’s why you had me change and took those that pics!”  Tim said, “It looks just like me!”<br />
<br />
“You know it, babe.”  Kelvin said and gave Tim a big kiss.<br />
<br />
Graham said, “OK, me next!” and puckered up.<br />
<br />
Kelvin reached over, ran a thumb down the scar on Graham’s right cheek that disappeared into his thick black beard, smiled and promptly swabbed Graham’s tonsils with his tongue.  Kelvin’s opinion of Graham had softened CONSIDERABLY in the last couple of months.<br />
<br />
Tim parted the two and said, “OK, break it up you two.  Well never get over to the ‘Thrope Center at this rate.  Remember, Richard made us promise.”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know.”  Kelvin said, putting his shirt back on.<br />
<br />
“Yeah; you know, it’s been very helpful to sit down and just talk to some of the elders about how I was treated as a kid for wanting to be a WereBear and I’ve learned so much about what we are now.  Of course I have first hand experience, now.  Funny how little I knew even though I had read everything I could on the subject.”  Graham said.<br />
<br />
“You knew little?  Hell, you knew more than I did.”  Tim said as they grabbed jackets and keys.<br />
<br />
The three left the house; Kelvin on his Harley, cigar clamped in his jaw and Tim and “Gray” as they called him now in Tim’s old beat up pickup.<br />
<br />
When they left, the Grizzly Bear statue on the mantle became active…  Hank was well pleased with all that had happened, but he had business to attend to…</p>
