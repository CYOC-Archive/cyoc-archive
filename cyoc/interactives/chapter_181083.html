<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rita couldn&#39;t just decide on one particular dish. It was an all you can eat, so she had to take advantage of different assortments. For an appetizer, she went with the calamari, the main course would be the grilled steak, to drink, she decided on a soda called &#39;stalk soda&#39; which she couldn&#39;t make much sense of, and desert would be strawberry shortcake. She gather her dishes on a tray and tried to find a table preferably away from Parker. Him licking out of his ice cream bowls seemed off putting to her.<br />
<br />
As Rita seated herself, the aroma of the food was filling her with positive vibes. She took the first bite into the calamari. Normally seafood wasn&#39;t a favorite of hers, but the calamari had given a burst of savory flavor, especially with the provided soy sauce that complemented the sweet flavor. Rita was feeling giddy from taste as her legs seemed to squirm around. As she continues to eat, her legs started to turn to a saturated red and pale white. Some bumps also seemed to grow from her front and back legs to her lower back and crotch. The more she ate, the bumps grew longer as the bone density in her legs seemed to be disappearing. Rita&#39;s knee joints started to smoothen out as the texture of her skin on her legs started to go from smooth to slimey. The four additional growths around her lower body started to grow and shape the same way as from the waist down, Rita looked like she had six tentacle for legs. The tentacles that were her legs slipped off her shorts as they wiggled freely.<br />
<br />
Before finishing the calamari, she felt parched and started drinking the stalk soda. The sweet taste sent a pleasant feeling to her eyes for some reason. As she looked at the grilled steak with her slightly bulging eyes, Rita&#39;s mouth watered in anticipation. The steak was tender and juicy as it seemed to be cooked to a pleasant medium. For some reason, Rita&#39;s body started feeling powerful as it seemed as apposed to her lower body, her chest and arms seemed to be gaining muscle density. As she chomped down in the steak, her chest started swelling as her stomach started to shape up to 6 pack abs and her b cup breasts seem to have shrunk as her chest broadened out into large masculine pecs. Her arms started swelling as muscle started to build up as her skin was having a rough time keeping them in line. In fact, her body was growing so rapidly that her veins were not only becoming visible, but also glowing a bright green color for some reason.<br />
<br />
Finishing the steak, Rita now had her bulging eyes on the soda. As she grabbed the glass hoping not to shatter it with her grip, she down the drink. With every gulp, her eyes were not only getting bigger, but her sockets seemed to be extending out of her head entirely. After finishing, her eyes opened up to a new perspective. She almost seemed like she was looking in two different directions at the same time. But she hadn&#39;t noticed that her eye sockets had extended outside of her head being held up by thin stalks. Not that she&#39;d worry as she eyes her final piece. The strawberry shortcake.<br />
<br />
Rita took her first bite into the fluffy sensation. The sweet taste had her tentacles wiggling in excitement. With every taste of sweet strawberry, her hair started to change to merge into clumps and change from an ebony black, to a leaf green. The texture of her hair also seemed to change to a rough leaf texture as the top of her head seemed to resemble a strawberry stem. Rita had consumed more of the shortcake as the stem not only seemed to be blossoming even more, but spreading down her back like a sort of mane. Her skin also seemed to turn from tan to a pink shade as bumps started to appear on her entire body that looked like yellow seeds.<br />
<br />
As Rita finished the shortcake, she stood up on her six tentacles to stretch her newly formed muscles. &quot;Wow! What a meal!&quot; She shouted flexing her massive muscles while gaining the attention of another patron of the restraunt. Parker stopped licking his latest bowl to look in the direction he heard the shout from. He saw his neighbor Rita looking a bit different than usual. He saw her with  leafs at the top of her head flowing down her back, her skin being bright pink with tiny yellow spots, her eyes bulging out her head, her wiggling tentacles that acted as legs, and muscles that would put male bodybuilders to shame. Parker felt a rush of excitement seeing Rita like that for some reason. In fact, not only was his udder lactating, but his breasts were with the same glowing liquid. With his newly formed kangaroo like legs, he hopped over to Rita.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Rita. Looking good like always.&quot; Rita stopped flexing for a minute to see Parker behind him. &quot;Hey Parker. You... Don&#39;t look bad yourself.&quot; She stuttered slightly. It was at this moment the host returned to his two favorite (and only) customers. &quot;I see we&#39;re enjoying ourselves. Tell you what, whenever you two are done dining, we also have a special entertainment room full of fun activities for the both of you...&quot; He looks at parker for a moment. &quot;Such as a milking machine...&quot; Parker couldn&#39;t tell why, but the thought of getting his udder milked by a machine made his tail wag in excitement. &quot;Or a workout room...&quot; He says looking at Rita. Rita flexed her muscles in response. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just say the word to our recreation guys over there and we&#39;ll have activities sorted for your needs!&quot; The host floated off again as Parker and Rita looked at the two men in blue suits with just as big smiles as the host. &quot;This place has everything doesn&#39;t it? What a weird restraunt.&quot; Rita commented. &quot;I&#39;m not gonna complain.&quot; Parker says rubbing his udder. &quot;What do you say we catch up a little before we head over.&quot; Parker sat down at Rita&#39;s table. &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Rita sat right next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two subjects mutated already. This is splendid!&quot; The host says returning to his podium. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see who comes in next!&quot;</p>
