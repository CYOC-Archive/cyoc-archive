<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When he reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet, he found his new address. And a new key. And insurance cards he never had before. And hundred dollar bills. Troy’s new apartment was actually in a rather nice part of town. Apparently making 40 dollars an hour doing day labor 60 hours a week came with a few benefits. <br />
<br />
He was simply dumbfounded. Even if he had to be a giant, hulking Rhox with only three opposable fingers, the perks were amazing. And honestly, being big was kinda awesome too. Pedestrians moved out of his way, cars stopped for him to cross because they would not likely survive collisions with him, his pain tolerance was also quite a bit higher to boot.<br />
<br />
Lancer was still talking about how many things Mark had gotten right and wrong about his world. It had started rather endearing, but now it was simply grating. Troy decided to put an end to that.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you give him a write-up?” Troy said, interrupting the Leonin.<br />
<br />
“Hmm?”<br />
<br />
“Use a computer, type up a gazetteer on your world, and send it to him.” Troy said, rubbing the base of his nasal horn.<br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t that be rude?”<br />
<br />
“Not if you tell him you came form the world in question. Explain I summoned you.” Troy shrugged. “He should take it pretty well. Or not. I mean, he might be upset. But you won’t know unless you ask.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm…Yes, I believe I shall do that, then.” Lancer nodded.<br />
<br />
They finally arrived at his ‘new’ apartment. It was 15 blocks away from the game store-a shorter walk than to his old apartment. He lived in a split-level duplex in a nice subdivision. He took a deep breath and opened his door.<br />
<br />
Inside was a rather boringly decorated home. The furniture was big and sturdy, clearly built for a Rhox. Even his bathroom was rhino-sized, with a reinforced toilet. He chuckled to himself when he saw that. Troy owned the latest game systems and two state-of-the-art desktop computers. His fridge, when he checked it, was half filled with leafy greens while the other half was filled with steaks. He supposed that was because Lancer was his boyfriend in this reality.<br />
<br />
“Hey Lancer, what is it that you do again?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“You mean as a profession?” Lancer raised a furred brow. “I believe the term is ‘unemployed’. Not many people consider ‘slayer of evil’ a legitimate profession in this world.”<br />
<br />
“Huh. You don’t say?” Troy said dryly, taking out a beer from the fridge and popping the cap before downing the sweet nectar.  “Why not go look for a job on Monday?”<br />
<br />
“You wish for me to work?” Lancer stared at me curiously.<br />
<br />
“You’re home all day, right?”<br />
<br />
“I am here to keep you safe, Troy. That is my job as your summon.”<br />
<br />
“Was. You aren’t a summon anymore.” Troy pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Hmm. I shall search the ‘internet’ for professions someone without any experience can obtain.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded. “Good. You’ll understand how this world works and hate it just like your old one.”<br />
<br />
Lancer laughed. “Yes, I suppose my naive view of your world will be shattered when I meet the cold reality of it.”<br />
<br />
“There’s reason your world is where we go when we want to escape ours.” <br />
<br />
“Mmm. ‘The grass is always greener’.”<br />
<br />
“You ever want to go back?”<br />
<br />
Lancer paused. “Not yet. I don’t have anything to go back to, really. But I am concerned with the way reality has shifted. You are rather flirty with other people and I prefer to be monogamous.”<br />
<br />
“You know, there are a few humans left out there.” Troy spoke slyly. “Perhaps you’d like a three-way?”<br />
<br />
Lancer grinned toothily. “That is an interesting idea. You wouldn’t mind?”<br />
<br />
“Not at all. It wouldn’t be fair to you otherwise.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed.” Lancer nodded, then paused. “Troy?”<br />
<br />
“Yes?”<br />
<br />
“You are aware that Drake and Drew are Book owners, right?”<br />
<br />
Troy stared at him. “How…?”<br />
<br />
“I’m a summoned creature. I am mostly unaffected by reality changes that are not directed at me.”<br />
<br />
Troy thought for a moment. Why hadn’t he dealt with Drew and Drake?<br />
<br />
“I suppose…I just didn’t think interrupting the game with a magic fight would be socially acceptable.”<br />
<br />
“They will be a problem later.”<br />
<br />
“Why do we even have to fight?” Troy shrugged. “It just seems like forced conflicts. I could have turned Drew into a furry and Drake into a literal drake. But…I dunno, my heart just isn’t in it right now. I got what I wanted from the Book. Why jeopardize that with a fight?”<br />
<br />
“Because you may be done with the Book, but Drew and Drake clearly aren’t. Drew seemed very interested in Drake’s magic.”<br />
<br />
“I recognize that.” Troy shrugged. “So let them fight. I won my first battle. It’s like…brackets, I guess, in a tourney. I’ll fight whoever wins.”<br />
<br />
“Transmutation is a dangerous Book to fight.” Lancer pointed out.<br />
<br />
“So is Myth and Beast. All of them, really, if they get the drop on you.” Troy said. “I made friends with both of them. They should be interested in talking rather than straight-up screwing me over the first chance they get. The social angle is a dynamic to this thing that I can play to the hilt.”<br />
<br />
“Drake is not mentally stable. Drew is emotionally compromised. You are playing with fire.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed. But humans tamed fire. I’m gonna try winning this game without taking anyone out myself by being smart. Drew and Drake are currently my allies. Two Book owners are stronger than one with two Books, because it’s a game of ambushing people unawares.”<br />
<br />
“So you believe they will ally with you until the end?”<br />
<br />
“It’s the smart move, and both Drew and Drake are clearly smart enough to recognize that, based on how they played in DND.”<br />
<br />
“True. And my plan is to make myself the kind of guy they want to have win, not betray. Like, if they do betray me, it should really hurt them. Which should give me some warning, based on their behaviour.”<br />
<br />
Lancer shook his head. “You should have removed them from play immediately.”<br />
<br />
Troy wanted to tell him that ruining someone’s life wasn’t that easy. But Lancer was a Paladin. He’d killed people back on his world. To him, killing someone was easy, a way of life, a profession. For Troy…taking out Drew and Drake made him a bit nauseous. His phone beeped, interrupting his thoughts. He pulled it from its holster and checked it. A message from his boss, Owen, the giant orc who’d fucked him in the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“See ya tomorrow at 8 ;p *eggplant**eggplant**eggplant**watersplash*”-Owen<br />
<br />
The Rhox blushed darkly and shook his massive head. What a moron! But it was kinda cute and endearing. Fucking his own boss…that seemed so unprofessional, but it was clearly working out for him, judging just by the apartment. <br />
<br />
Wait, there were other contacts, too. Troy took his time and scrolled through the new contacts in his phone. Shiloh-the photo showed a giant anthro-grizzly bear with a happy toothy grin on his face. David-An anthro gorilla with a frown on his face, holding a giant fish. His proudest moment, clearly. They had been filed under his work contacts and his friend contacts, alongside Mark and the other players in the DND group.<br />
<br />
“Guess mah life is really better like this.” Troy frowned.<br />
<br />
“I am heading to bed. You should get some sleep as well, as you work tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Yes dear.” Troy said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Lancer smirked. “And you will sleep on the couch.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Troy said flatly.<br />
<br />
“You slept with another man. This is punishment.” Lancer replied, crossing his arms. “No sex.”<br />
<br />
“B-but-!”<br />
<br />
“Goodnight.” Lancer walked up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Troy sighed and got some blankets out of the hall closet and set up the living room. He went to bed, scrolling through his social media pages until he passed out. Sleep came upon him like  a heavy, pleasant shroud, and he dreamed of his work. It was a strange dream, where he had no idea who these people were. They were familiar yet so distant to him. <br />
<br />
His alarm woke him up at 7 AM sharp the next morning. Yawning, Troy got up and stretched, his horn brushing the ceiling. His huge muscles flexed pleasantly and he lumbered to the bathroom, showering and getting ready for work. Lancer came down and made coffee and a salad for Troy to eat. He consumed it ravenously, then walked out the door, making sure to grab his Book along the way. Drew and Drake might be in his pocket, but that didn’t mean the other Book owners weren’t around.<br />
<br />
“Troy!” Lancer called after him.<br />
<br />
Troy turned and had to scramble to catch keys that Lancer had thrown at him. He looked at them, confused. With one big finger, he pressed the lock button. A giant truck nearby clicked its locks. He looked at it, grin spreading across his muzzle. He had a truck! It was big and red and a dualie and likely consumed tons of gas.<br />
<br />
He happily hopped into the driver’s seat and started it up, enjoying the rumble of the engine as it roared to life. Having money was awesome! Now he didn’t have to walk everywhere! He drove to the construction site and parked it in a cordoned-off lot nearby.<br />
<br />
Owen was waiting for him. The huge, green-skinned ogre was wearing his work gear and staring at him with unbridled lust. Troy lumbered over to his boss and pulled on his hard hat. <br />
<br />
“What’s the work for today, boss?”<br />
<br />
“The usual.” Owen shrugged, licking his tusks as his eyes roamed over Troy’s muscular form. “You and Shiloh and David are going to work on breaking up the road, shoveling it into the dump truck. Five hundred feet by end of day.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded and wondered if five hundred feet was a lot. For humans, probably. Likely back-breaking work. For a Rhox, a gorilla, and a bear? 8-10 hour gig. <br />
<br />
Speaking of his crew, two more trucks pulled up and parked next to Owen and Troy. Out stepped a giant, stern-looking gorilla with a small gut and a huge grizzly bear who was heaving with muscles and shaggy fur. They joined Owen and Troy in the morning huddle. Shiloh, the bear, grabbed a bunch of coffees and passed them around. They chatted, made small talk while sipping their hot cups of java.<br />
<br />
“Alright boys, you’ve got your marching orders.” Owen rumbled. “It’s a scorcher today, so take breaks every hour and stay hydrated.”<br />
<br />
They nodded and Troy lumbered along with his crew-mates. Shiloh was happy, fun-loving, and outgoing. He constantly made jokes and talked about the latest movie and videos he saw. David…he was quiet and kept to himself, though clearly interested in what Shiloh said, despite staying mostly silent and one-word the whole day.<br />
<br />
Troy found the work very easy-in fact, this was the easiest job he’d ever had! So easy that it became rather rout and boring. They used jackhammers and then hauled the chunks of asphalt to the dump-truck and tossed it in. As a human, he would have no way of doing any of that without heavy-duty equipment, but as a Rhox, it was like tossing light stone.<br />
<br />
His muscles flexed with every chunk he tossed, and vibrated strangely whenever he broke up concrete and asphalt with a jackhammer. It made him feel powerful and huge…because that was what he was. The work was perfect for someone with a body like mine, though clearly for someone who didn’t mind being bored. Or…hmm. Maybe Shiloh and David were two opposing views on the work. Shiloh made his own fun to fight off boredom and repetition, whereas David clearly used it to think about other things aside form work.<br />
<br />
Their first break came and went. He drank a whole gallon of water. <br />
<br />
They continued working, and soon it was half-past one and they were eating lunch. Troy had gotten a huge salad from a nearby bodega and woofed it down. He was really liking the job so far, even if he was a little bored with it. Owen came around in his truck and winked at Troy.<br />
<br />
“Heh, that guy’s really sweet on you, Troy.” Shiloh said, smirking and waving at the boss.<br />
<br />
“He’s nice.” Troy agreed.<br />
<br />
David stayed silent and ate his bananas. <br />
<br />
They resumed work for another hour, but Troy got a call on his radio. He answered it.<br />
<br />
“Hey Troy. Come meet me behind the dump truck.” Owen&#39;s voice crackled.<br />
<br />
“Will do boss.” Troy replied.<br />
<br />
“Getting some ‘special attention’, eh Troy?” Shiloh guffawed and elbowed Troy.<br />
<br />
“No!” Troy replied hotly, blushing.<br />
<br />
“Hasn’t called us.” David spoke. “Are you dating?”<br />
<br />
“Ummm…” Troy’s ears wriggled nervously.<br />
<br />
“Hey man, as long as you keep the boss satisfied, then the guy’s not hitting on us.” Shiloh said.<br />
<br />
“Agreed. His fingers kept finding their way into my ass.” David scratched his armpit with his foot. “Not unpleasant, but very distracting.”<br />
<br />
“From what?” Shiloh asked.<br />
<br />
“My novel.”<br />
<br />
“You’re writing a novel?” Troy asked, curious.<br />
<br />
“Yes. In my head.” The gorilla man shrugged. “Then I go home and write it for real.”<br />
<br />
“I wish I had a big ogre claiming my ass.” Shiloh guffawed. “Well, go on, Troy. Don’t keep your lover waiting~!”<br />
<br />
Troy snorted and shook his massive head as he lumbered off to the dump truck. Dumbass. Though he did wonder why Owen had never made a move on the grizzly. He was single too, after all.<br />
<br />
Owen waited for him, chest heaving and work boots tapping a staccato on the pavement. He looked up when Troy approached. The massive ogre had chosen a secluded spot where no one would see them getting down and dirty. Behind them was an unused store, the dump truck concealed them from the north, and a bunch of concrete blocks and heavy machines blocked any other prying eyes from view.<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Owen winked and walked over, sniffing the air. “You smell good.”<br />
<br />
“I smell sweaty.” Troy grinned.<br />
<br />
The big ogre embraced him, and Troy found himself pawing at the ogre’s tight, unyielding muscles. The ogre groped Troy’s junk and his other hand slid across Troy’s ass, tugging on his tail. Troy’s cock grew hard. They kissed, Troy sliding between the ogre’s tusks and playing in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…” Owen gasped. “Yer so goddamn hot!”<br />
<br />
“Yer big.” Troy replied, slipping into Owen’s accent naturally. <br />
<br />
“Take it all off.” Owen growled.<br />
<br />
“In public?” Troy inwardly quailed.<br />
<br />
“Of course. Public sex is so hot and dangerous!” Owen’s eyes glinted. “Come on, strip!”<br />
<br />
Troy took a breath and stripped himself naked. He stood, cock spring forth from his jockstrap. Owen took his clothes and set them on a crate nearby. Troy saw his Book in the pile and moved his clothes to cover it. Owen raised a bushy brow but said nothing. He stripped down himself, revealing his hugely muscled  body. Troy eyed that luscious green cock, mouth watering. <br />
<br />
“Come on, best view is over here.” Owen grinned and pulled Troy towards the barriers. He could see his coworkers and pedestrians on the other side of the street, along with a line of cars. The barrier was tall, up to his neck. No one would be able to see them.<br />
<br />
A finger wormed itself into his donut, making Troy jump and bellow.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, keep it quiet.” Owen smirked. “Don’t want to alert anyone of somethin’.”<br />
<br />
Troy groaned as the finger twisted and knuckled his prostate, precum drooling from his dick. The ogre managed to loom over the side of his neck, nibbling at his tubular ears and fondling Troy’s balls. The finger withdrew as Troy relaxed, only to be replaced by a huge green cock.<br />
<br />
“Ready?” Owen whispered in Troy’s ear.<br />
<br />
Troy nodded.<br />
<br />
The massive shaft entered him, pushing roughly past his loosened hole and battering his prostate. Troy gasped and clenched involuntarily, insides squeezing the ogre’s immense girth. Owen moaned and began fucking him.<br />
<br />
Troy could only grip the concrete barrier as his boss fucked his hole raw.</p>
