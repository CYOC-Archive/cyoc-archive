<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hailey x Geshp?!? Not on my watch<br />
<br />
Hailey was feeling completely self conscious that night, she didn’t know what to wear and she had no idea how she was going to handle this. Geshp was a wildcard and seemed to be an ally but she didn’t know his true allegiance or what he wanted. She kept thinking back to the island when he saw her in a state of undress, she realized this was all due to his lust. Right? This demon couldn’t actually like her? It made her feel queasy just thinking about it.<br />
Despite her insistence on this not being a date she knew he would be delusional enough to think otherwise, he may be a demon but he was still a man.<br />
Geshp was difficult to read, he seemed to be doing this as a kind gesture but men always has alternative motives, as her mom used to say, she couldn’t trust him, he may have saved her and Henry but she knew McMillan probably sent him. A demon would not go out of his way to help others, at least not without something, or someone, to gain.<br />
<br />
She had a bad feeling about all of this as she dressed; she wore dark grey jeans with black, steel tipped boots, a grey and red flannel shirt under a red leather jacket. She tied her blonde hair into a ponytail and made sure she brought her gun with her.<br />
Hailey wished she could bring a silver cross with her, maybe that would keep him at a distance but because she was a vampire it would end up hurting her too.<br />
She took the time to drink a bag of blood before Geshp picked her up. She hated that; there was an underlying air of sexism about this whole affair: HE was picked HER up, he invited her to go somewhere HE wanted to go without her consent and in a way she knew she couldn’t refuse by asking in front of everybody. Plus he was going to “teach her” about this testosterone filled event.<br />
Then she thought back to her fight with Jolie, she’d seem to have known Geshp or at least be familiar with his past. Her phone buzzed and she saw that it was a was from security that informed her that the devil was out front to pick her up. With an eye roll she told them to tell him that she was still getting ready. He could wait, she needed some answers fist, and they’re was only one person who could give them to her.<br />
<br />
Hailey made her way to the holding cells, inside one of the thick magic-insulation chambers Jolie was kept in special cylindrical restraints that surrounded her hands and stopped her from moving them and a metal gag that made sure she couldn’t speak. Her arms and legs were cuffed with chains that spear her limbs apart and belt her suspended above ground.<br />
<br />
“Can I speak with her, alone?” She said to the security guard.<br />
<br />
He looked at her quizzically but with a nod he left the two alone.<br />
<br />
“Just make sure she stays gaged, we can’t risk her using any magic.” He cautioned on his way out.<br />
<br />
Hailey nodded and when he was gone she opened the glass sheiks to the containment and got closer to Jolie.<br />
The girl’s pale blue eyes followed the young vampire as she inspected the captive girl.<br />
<br />
“So here’s the deal: I’ll undo your gag and we can talk. If you try to cast a spell verbally I’ll make you wish you hadn’t resurrected yourself.” The blonde offered.<br />
<br />
Jolie nodded and Hailey unlocked her gag. The white haired girl adjusted her jaw before speaking.<br />
<br />
“What could you possibly want to speak to me about?” The necromancer asked and cocked her head.<br />
<br />
“Geshp. What do you know about him?” Hailey asked.<br />
<br />
“Geshp? I thought you were on the same side?” The girl asked in return.<br />
<br />
“Of course not. The Director called him in, I don’t know how she knows him but I don’t trust him. I have a…mission involving him and I’d like to know more about him.” The blonde then asked.<br />
<br />
“A mission? Well he’s a  devil and a very powerful demon lord, runs one of the circles of hell, I’ve retrieved several souls from there that tell tales of his immense cruelty and sadistic atrocities, blah blah blah. But I’m guessing you want something more…personal?” Jolie said with a mischievous smile.<br />
<br />
Hailey didn’t answer but Jolie noticed her hesitation and giggled,<br />
<br />
“What? Don’t tell me you’re interested in him?!” She laughed.<br />
<br />
“N-no of course not! It’s for a mission!” She replied in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“Hailey’s got a boyfriend! Hailey’s got a boyfriend!” The teenage necromancer sang.<br />
<br />
“NO! No I do not! It’s for a mission!” The blonde insisted much to Jolie’s amusement.<br />
<br />
“Hailey and Geshp, siting in a tree! K-I-S-S—“ the girl was cut off by Hailey putting her hand over Jolie’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“Be quiet! I am not interested in that demon, the rea— eeww! What the hell?!” Hailey cut off and pulled her hand away from the girl’s mouth when she started licking the woman’s hand.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong with you?” The vampire asked, wiping her hand on her pants.<br />
<br />
“How about you tell me what’s really going on or I’m not helping you.” Jolie said and stuck out her tongue at the young woman.<br />
<br />
Hailey cursed and reluctantly showed her the ticket.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… So he invited you to some wrestling thing? That’s not a good idea.” Jolie said.<br />
<br />
“Why not—I mean, I don’t really want to go but I can’t say no.” Hailey replied.<br />
<br />
“Because the last time a woman went somewhere with him he ended up marrying her, and things didn’t end well.” The girl said and Hailey blushed.<br />
<br />
“What?! I’m definitely not going to marry this asshole! What do you mean? He is or was married?” The vampire asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea, he was. She was an agent just like you: strong, opinionated, beautiful, independent. Then one day he invites her to coffee, harmless right? The next thing everyone knows she’s suddenly all lovely-dovey with him, she always gushes about him, drops all of her interests for his. She even starts dressing up for him, and then they get married.” The white haired girl explained.<br />
<br />
“Then what?” Hailey asked.<br />
<br />
“Then the newly wed Demon Lady goes missing, she went to live with him and was never seen again. Some say she was killed but I’ve never been able to obtain or even find her soul, not something easy to do. He never talks about her and gets quiet when people bring her up. He seems to have truly loved her but her change of personality seems suspicious and her disappearance even more so.” The necromancer finished.<br />
<br />
Hailey thanked Jolie and told her she would try to out in a good word for her with the Director but couldn’t promise anything.<br />
She went to the front of the facility to meet Geshp, weary on what the night would bring.</p>
