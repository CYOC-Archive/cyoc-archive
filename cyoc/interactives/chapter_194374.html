<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fuck, I thought try-outs were today! I&#39;m so sorry, Eric.&quot; Tom sat at the small table the next morning sipping at a warm cup of tea. He&#39;d tried picking at some of the breakfast spread Clyde had set out before making a face and spitting it into a napkin as politely as he could. &quot;I guess I&#39;ve been a bit distracted.&quot; He blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Eric laughed. &quot;The fact that you&#39;re staying makes up for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom set down his drink and popped up to give Eric a massive hug and a ruffle of his fur. &quot;<i>My brother,</i> One of Santa&#39;s Reindeer.&quot; They laughed together at the absurdity of the phrase, though Eric found himself scrunching his nose subconsciously. While Tom smelled a hell of a lot better today--he&#39;d even taken advantage of some of Clyde&#39;s expansive scented oil collection--Eric noted a tangy musk coming from his brother&#39;s fur. It wasn&#39;t bad, per se, but it was strong and he&#39;d have to get used to it. &quot;Congratulations, Eric. I&#39;m so fucking proud of you, broski.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We should probably get going here soon,&quot; Clyde quipped from the kitchen where he busied himself with a few last minute preparations between bites of oatcakes and carrots. &quot;Rudy is a stickler for punctuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and glanced back to Tom. &quot;What are your plans for the day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I&#39;m going to bring Lars some breakfast I can actually eat. Sorry again, Clyde.&quot; He winced, though the reindeer smiled good naturedly in response. &quot;Then I think I&#39;m going to start bringing some of my stuff over to Lars&#39; apartment. I really appreciate the hospitality, but I think I should let you two lovebirds have your space.&quot; Eric snorted at this. Tom clearly wanted easier access to his werefox. &quot;I also need to get some clothes that actually fit. And I want to give Mom a call. She still thinks I&#39;m coming home for Thanksgiving, but that clearly isn&#39;t going to happen anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric grimaced. &quot;Can you wait for me before you call her? I&#39;d like to talk to her, too...&quot; He had no idea what he&#39;d say, or where even to start. But it&#39;d be nice to hear her voice. Tom nodded.<br />
<br />
Clyde seemed to notice Eric&#39;s agitation as he patted his shoulder comfortingly while crossing to the stairs and clomping up to grab something from their room.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to have to break the news soon, you know.&quot; Tom mused, looking just as lost as Eric felt. &quot;We&#39;ll figure something out. Maybe we&#39;ll spare her the specific details until we know for sure our next steps. I actually need to meet with some of the members of the werefox tribe about my situation as it is. That&#39;s going to be a fun conversation....&quot;<br />
<br />
Clyde clomped back down the stairs holding a bundle of leather straps. &quot;We&#39;ve got to go.&quot; He pulled Tom into a quick hug before reaching out for Eric&#39;s hand. &quot;Feel free to stay as long as you need, veli. We&#39;ll be back late tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Eric breathed in and out in a steady rhythm as he focused. He&#39;d been in such a hurried panic the previous morning, he barely remembered the change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let your core guide you,&quot; Clyde talked him through it again patiently, &quot;Feel it shift your center of gravity. Open yourself up to your Reindeer DNA and just let it guide the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt himself falling forward as his body began to grow, his hips popped with a dull ache as his pelvis adjusted and he snorted and rested his hands on the ground. He watched as his fingers lost their dexterity, his thumb pulling in while what felt like his pinky finger separated and they settled as dew claws. It didn&#39;t hurt, but God it felt strange--like his entire limbs had fallen asleep, pins and needles dancing up and down his arms and legs.<br />
<br />
He shook his head as his neck readjusted forward on his spine, his neck stretching out and bulking up to support his growing head and antlers, their familiar weight comforting him as he pawed at the ground. He grunted as he felt his thick sheath fill out and his balls balloon to their feral size as the changes finished with a flourish.<br />
<br />
He watched in amazement as Clyde shifted in response, his eyes drawn to the growing sheath as he found himself wondering what it would be like to rut in these forms, a familiar tingle in his nethers. Clyde finished and sniffed the air, turning to give Eric a look. &quot;Focus, Söpö.&quot; He gave a deep chuckle. &quot;We&#39;re at work now.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Rudy stood poring over notes and paperwork on a small podium at the edge of a large field. Behind him, an ornate clock with bold lettering, embellished with silver and gold and framed with an elaborate wreath, read <b>39 Days to Christmas</b>. Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds counted down magically. Eric had gasped when they entered. The facility was massive and surprisingly high tech, and reminded him of the professional training facilities his dad had taken him to growing up. This was definitely the big leagues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, you&#39;ll be in position 2, next to Clyde in the Lead Team, behind me. Onni, you&#39;re to move to Aksel&#39;s old spot in position 5, next to Arvo.&quot; Rudy called out. &quot;Tag you&#39;ll be in 4 next to Heikki. Mathias and Bix you will remain in your Sled Team positions.&quot; Eric had been reintroduced to the team upon arrival, and he looked over to each in turn, repeating their names to himself, determined to memorize them all. Clyde had promised to explain what each of the positions meant later, but for now they needed to pay attention.<br />
<br />
As they lined up, elves rushed to and fro, gearing them up. Evidently Johann had sent his measurements to the workshop last night as Elf Dave explained, strapping him in. &quot;This is the practice halter. Just wait until you see the ceremonial tack for the big night. It&#39;s glorious!&quot; Eric shook his head and shifted from foot to foot, feeling the comfortable weight. It fit perfectly. He snorted, seeing Clyde grinning over at him as the larger reindeer butted their flanks together playfully before they were hitched together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see how this works out before we break out into teams. You must be in absolute sync with your partner. One misstep and we&#39;ve ruined a kid&#39;s Christmas.&quot;  Rudy put them through their paces. He was a supportive but strict drill sergeant as he ran them through exercise after exercise, barking out corrections and striving for perfection from day one.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;You did well today, Pikkuveli.&quot; Rudy slid a few beers across the table to Eric and Clyde as he took his seat next to Clara at the table. &quot;Though you need to commit and trust yourself instead of looking to Clyde for guidance. You are equals, and the lead team needs to be confident. You are the dexterity of the formation and second guessing means you&#39;re less agile.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dinner set before them was magnificent. Mrs. Clause had gone all out to welcome the team back into session as fruit pies, salads, cakes, roasted vegetables, and more piled high. And it was all cooked to perfection. They clearly took their feasts here seriously, no wonder they had so many of them. Eric tore into an oat pastry topped with reindeer lichen--the fuzzy white fungus Clyde&#39;s parents had brought the other day--he groaned contentedly, finding the taste irresistible as he quickly took a few more from the platter.<br />
<br />
The gathering had begun with a quick speech and welcome from Santa, before Aksel was honored with a series of stories and thank you speeches from members of the team. He had been given an honorary spot at the table next to the Clauses, where he sat with his mate, who teared up throughout.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s to be inducted as an Elder at the next Neuvosto,&quot; Clyde whispered reverently, nudging Eric as they clapped.<br />
<br />
The feast ran late into the night, and reindeer knew how to party. The team had all brought their mates with them, though Eric noticed that Bix and Tag had both come alone. &quot;Where is Bix&#39;s mate?&quot; Eric asked Clyde quietly, he&#39;d figured Tag was still single.<br />
<br />
Clyde&#39;s ears drooped as he leaned in and whispered quietly. &quot;She passed away 5 years ago... It was incredibly sad.&quot; Eric nodded and leaned into Clyde, his intoxication amplifying his reaction to the sad news. That explained a lot, Eric realized, wondering if the older reindeer was lonely. <br />
<br />
The dour mood didn&#39;t last long, however, as Rudy soon led the room in a raucous drinking song. &quot;<i>Work Hard, Play Hard</i>,&quot; Eric laughed as Clyde encouraged him to join in, even though he didn&#39;t know the lyrics.</p>
