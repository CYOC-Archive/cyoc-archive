<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul went home that afternoon. The zipper lay crumpled on his palm and the thought lingered in his mind. Remembering what happened in the shop is difficult. When he thought he’d remember an inkling of thought, it would fleet away and be forgotten. What he does remember is a young thin-eyed clerk with a hint of an immovable smirk on his face. He said the powers held within this zipper. The power to turn people into suits, wear them and become like them. It’s absurd when you think about it. But somehow, and in some way, the way he said those abilities with conviction. There is not a hint of a lie in the words that left his mouth. He believed everything he said, and Paul can’t help but do the same thing. <br />
<br />
Paul came home to an empty house. Well… mostly. His mother is gone, probably in her baking class uptown. His stepfather is a famous doctor around this part, and he won’t be home until later this evening. His little brother, however, recently came judging by his strewn shoes and school bag. If it was him who made that mess, Paul would get an earful from his parents. But Declan is their golden child. He is perfection personified from their eyes. It’s expected behavior since Paul is his mother’s “accident”. An unwanted child from someone she fucked at a party. When his mother found another man, she treated Paul like a parasite freeloading on her blessings. His stepfather joined in on the fun, and soon enough, his younger brother as well. It’s hell at first but Paul got used to the hurt. At 17, their harsh words just phase through him. He planned to leave at 18 but with this ancient magical thing on his fingers, his plans changed. For better or for worse? He’s going to find out. <br />
<br />
Declan could be heard from a mile away. Every time he came home, he’d rush to his game console that Paul never had a chance to play. He doesn’t have that many friends so he thrived with people online. <br />
<br />
Caught up in the middle of a match, Declan didn’t realize Paul had already snuck inside his room. Declan wore nothing but a loose sweat-drenched white polo, and his freckled nape is a vulnerable spot that Paul capitalized. Inches before the surface, the tip of the zipper snaked out of Paul’s grasp and latched onto the skin. The effects were immediate. Declan slouched on his seat and the controller fell from his paralyzed fingers. The light in his eyes faded away, leaving nothing but a hollow look into the distance. Declan fell sideways but Paul caught him,<br />
<br />
Paul pulled his little brother from his seat and laid him on his bed. He could see his chest rise and fall, and a faint splotch of mist breathing in and out of his nose. He is still alive, mostly. He’s incapacitated but Paul thinks he won’t remember any of this. <br />
<br />
One by one, Paul pulled his brother’s clothes and threw them on the floor. The 12-year-old brat is left bare to the cold temperature. His white skin blushed pink, especially on his freckled cheeks and flaccid erogenous area. His flaccid penis is shrouded by his thick foreskin. Their father is a doctor and a staunch critic of circumcision. <br />
<br />
Paul grazed his fingers past his brother’s face, down to his neck, and circled twice around his pink nipples. If he were awake, Paul would have a black eye by now. The only sign Declan is sensing this is his penis arising from its slumber. Paul crouched down and gave it a lick. That extra thick foreskin is packed with flavor. It tasted like salted peanuts or a juicy skin of fried fish. Paul wanted to taste more but that’s not what he came here for.<br />
<br />
Holding on to his brother’s shoulders, Paul flipped his brother on his back. The golden zipper lines perfectly with the curvature of his spine. It started just below the nape and ended above his bubbly pink buttocks. Paul spread those cheeks apart which revealed a tight, pink, and slightly wet asshole. It glistened from the room’s light.<br />
<br />
Paul pulled the tab slowly, letting the humid air inside the suit aerate out. It hissed and gave off the stench of a warm meat shop. By the end of it, his brother is nothing more than a suit. The outer surface is about a quarter of an inch thick. It’s warm and a beating heart is still felt around the chest area. The eyes that were once staring in the distance are now just holes that Paul could pass his fingers on. The golden hair that reached past the ears felt like the real one. For a brat, Declan kept it smooth and clean. Paul pulled it in for a whiff, and he could smell the stink of sweat and faint male shampoo. <br />
<br />
Before the next step, Paul undressed.<br />
<br />
The hands were the first to enter the suit. The air inside isn’t the only thing humid. The inner surface is wet and it writhes as if it was alive. It coiled and beat, and grew tighter the more Paul pushed inside. He did the same thing for the other arm and two of his feet.<br />
<br />
The penis is a problem though. Paul’s package is twice longer despite its flaccid state. Declan’s penis is mostly foreskin and the suit seems stretchable, so Paul engorged his dick first before charging in. <br />
<br />
As Paul finished the body, he felt it push him from all directions. The level of his vision decreased. Before, he stood way above the handles of Declan’s cabinet. Now, he’s level with the handle. He opened the cabinet where a mirror hangs behind the door. <br />
<br />
Paul’s height did change. Not only that, his head looked comical in his now smaller body. His hands could not feel the second skin of this suit anymore. He could feel the wind brush between his fingers. His back could feel the cold, which sent shivers all across his body. The sensation of his penis didn’t change much. He expected the sensation of it turning smaller, but nothing like that happened. His dick, although smaller at first glance, is not that really small as compared to his new body size. <br />
<br />
Finally, Paul pulled the mask over his face. As he did, the zipper closed on its own. <br />
<br />
Paul blinked once, and when he opened his new set of green eyes, Declan was staring back at him. The jerk. The naked brat. His step-brother and a third of his woes. A new face stared at him and Paul knew that face was his. <br />
<br />
There is a pang on Paul’s back. It’s painful but more of a discomfort. The skin on his nape reeled, and when he turned back. Paul saw the zipper falling to the floor. He tried to reattach it and saw that it could. In the meantime, he kept it hidden inside a secret compartment in the cabinet where other hidden stuff are stashed.<br />
<br />
Then Paul realized, how did he know about that secret compartment? How does he know that a small fleshlight and the lotion his mom lost weeks prior are also hidden there? Soon, the answer came in flashes. Declan’s memories rushed into Paul’s mind. Most are flashed way too fast to understand, but some are too important to miss. Declan Shoemaker is his name. His father is a doctor and his real mother left them for another man, which is enough reason for Declan to get bullied in school. They moved to this town for a new start, but the bullying soon followed. Declan loathes the name calls so he gets his due revenge by bullying Paul. It pissed Paul, even more, when he realized the shallow reason why his little brother is such a huge pain in the ass. But the resentment boiled down when he realized that it meant little as of now. Declan can’t do anything anymore when Paul is on the reins.</p>
