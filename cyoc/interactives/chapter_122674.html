<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Returning to the Chronivac, Dave spends more tine looking over its functionality. He could change other people, other things, even all of reality if he so desires. Dave reflected on himself for a moment, thinking about his wildest dreams, his darkest fantasies, anything he ever wanted. Dave was hit with an idea: an idea that gave Dave a massive hard on. One that wouldn&#39;t easily go away.<br />
<br />
Dave went to the Chronivac and boosted his own IQ. After, he returned to the dark web to research both high security hacking and the Chronivac. He found nothing on the machine, but he gained the skills to hack into any computer system he chose. From there, Dave started to overwrite his internet provider&#39;s coding, giving him access to other wireless providers.<br />
<br />
It took Dave several hours, but he managed to route all the major corporate internet entities to his computer. He had NASA, national governments, but the only thing he wanted from this was satellite control. He sent a ping throughout the world: and received over 7 billion responses: the entite world. Dave knew this would work, he had made himself smarter. But seeing it play out as he thought was rewarding to him, and he pushed through. He had the Chronivac send a signal through: to scan the entire population of Earth. Once returned, he bagan to play with the Chronivac and set up the rules for his new Earth.<br />
<br />
1. All humans will turn into their ideal male body, limited by things such as rational size and shape.<br />
2. Clothing does and can not exist except for leather/latex garments<br />
3. All people will not age, hunger, or thirst again, allowing them to focus on happiness<br />
4. Everybody will exist between the ages of 25 and 55<br />
5. David Franklin Kilkenny is granted the ability to do anything he says<br />
<br />
With these rules in play, Dave set the Chronivac to alter reality, so only he would know what happened. He would be the god of his own world, no longer needing the Chronivac for any &quot;outside&quot; help. He set the time of change for 12:00 pm worldwide, so he could travel around and watch his world come to life. Dave would change first, and then he&#39;d watch others change just as he did: into a world of perfect men.<br />
<br />
Dave was about to press enter, but he hesitated, even for his genius IQ. Even if it were a bad idea, he could fix it. He slammed enter on the keyboard, and immediately felt the changes take place.<br />
<br />
Dave moved out of his chair and to the wall mirror in his man cave. He saw his body fat shed away and muscle formed all over. His legs swelled out and his thighs grew out like barrels. His stomach chiseled out and his pecs swelled almost two inches out. Dave&#39;s body hair started receding while his arms started to balloon out was well. His hands and feet grew in size while his biceps grew way out and around. His neck muscles became defined and his jaw sharp. His face rearranged into a more symmetrical and toned face. His hair turned black and shortened on his head. Dave&#39;s skin started to darken all over into a deep beige. Dave grew as well, topping around 6&#39;5&quot; and his new muscle putting him at 265 pounds. At this point, Dave&#39;s body fat came back. It built around his arms and legs, giving him a smoother texture without taking away his strength. It also touched his torso and head, keeping his muscular features, but adding a sexier vibe to himself.<br />
<br />
After that, Dave&#39;s body hair came back as well. He grew in a sharp stubble around his chin and around his cheeks. His arms and legs were lightly covered in hair too, but his chest grew in a short fur all over, turning into a treasure trail down his abdomen and to his crotch. A bush began to grow around Dave&#39;s cock, but it stopped quickly leaving a well groomed mat around his junk. As the transformation slowed down, Dave was about to turn back to the Chronivac when he felt a tingling in his groin. Dave&#39;s cock began to grow, rapidly. His modest 6&quot; grew out to double the size, ending at 12.2&quot; long! Dave was incredibly horny, having a cock that rivaled his forearm. When it stopped growing in length, it started to swell out: making Dave wider than a soda can! He needed two hands to reach all the way around the shaft, but his tip grew out a little wider and longer too. Dave started to jack himself off when his balls started to swell out and drop down. They grew to the size of baseballs and hung halfway down his thighs! Dave continued to play with his massive junk until he felt an orgasm coming up. Dave was paralyzed with pleasure as his cock shot wave after wave of cum at the mirror pumping Dave dry of anything he had in him.<br />
<br />
Dave wanted to stop and rest, but he had made a world of his own and he needed to see it shape itself. To test his rules, Dave said, &quot;I am full of energy again.&quot; In an instant, Dave felt ready for anything, showing that his rules came true. He conjured a latex thong and put it on, unable to hide the massive 7&quot; soft bulge he had. Then he placed himself in Hawaii: the first place that would soon be 12pm.</p>
