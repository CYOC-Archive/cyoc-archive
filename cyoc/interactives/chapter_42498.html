<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back upstairs in her room, Colleen found some time alone.  She looked into the mirror at her lips.  They the only thing that she could see.  Her mind filled with half thought out questions.  Her mother had not really reacted to the changes to Colleen.  She wondered if it would extend to everyone else.  Her mother did not even notice the huge lips on Colleen's face.  Well that was not entirely true.<br />
<br />
Colleen could talk normally and with out swelling when ever her mother asked her a question.  Conversation had been fine also.  Talking normally eventually let Colleen forget about her lips.  It was only when she said something that was unimportant or obvious that her lips reacted.  She was surprised how often that could happen.  The odd thing was that when ever her lips swelled her mother would stare as if she was trying to figure out what had changed.  Then after looking away everything would be normal.  It was as if only the change was noticeable but once done then everything was fine.  It seemed that every time they grew her lips would become the focus of attention.<br />
<br />
Drinking tea from a cup had been a challenge.  Colleen had trouble getting her lips to form the required shape to keep the hot beverage from slipping around her mouth.  A little cursing and exclamations had made her lips bigger and the situation a little worse.  Drinking was almost out of the question without a straw she concluded, unless she remembered what caused them to go down.<br />
<br />
In the mirror Colleen gently fingered her mouth.  The lips were glossy and shimmering.  It was as if she had spent an hour applying layer after layer of lip gloss to her lips.  Every way she turned her head, her lips caught some light and the reflections only added drew attention the size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Id's lide the onlee hing pepo will see is my lips,&quot; she muttered.  Under her fingers she felt the slight swelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she exclaimed to another push.  &quot;Damn it.&quot;  And another.<br />
<br />
The worst part was that each time her lips swelled she felt amazing tingling.  Her mouth needed to be touched.  Her lips needed to be caressed.  Colleen tried to resist but they were so big she found it difficult to stop teasing them.  She lay down on her bed to think of anything other than her lips.<br />
<br />
Reclining, she started twirling a lock of hair that dangled down the side of her face.  Her other hand she placed across her belly.  And she tried to day dream.  She dreamed of the future where people gaped at her and said stupid things like: &quot;My, how big your lips are,&quot; or &quot;You've got bigger lips than someone famous,&quot; or &quot;Wow. I love how sexy your lips are.  Can we fuck?&quot;  Colleen also thought of how she would have to ignore them or make things worse by saying, &quot;Yes, they are big,&quot;  and &quot;I wish people would focus on something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like her breasts, she thought, her hand finding the underside curve.  She had great breasts now.  A little big for a normal person but not huge.  Once she had gotten new clothes people would have to to look down at her cleavage away from her lips.  They would have to get lost in her soft mounds and hard nipples.  Her fingers traced a circle around one hard nipple then the other.  Shivers seemed to move out and around her body.  Her body was lean and fit and tanned now.  Her thighs were nearly perfect.  She move her hand from her breast to her thigh.  Up and down her thigh her hand moved and she clenched her legs together trying to trap her hand.<br />
<br />
Her body would have to draw attention from her lips.  And she found herself tickling her lips with the end of her hair.  The brush-like end of her hair flicked back and forth across her lips.  Each time it made her lips scream with pleasure.  The attention on her lips was causing her to become hot between her legs.  Soon her hand was there, under her shorts and rubbing.  Dropping her hair, Colleen started sucking on her fingers.  Her lips were clenching and sliding all over her fingers.  Her mouth was wet and everything was getting slippery.  One hand on her crotch and one in her mouth.  Both were moving rhythmically getting faster and faster.  The attention at both ends sent waves of warmth and pleasure out through her whole body.  Soon Colleen was lost in the sensation.  Her body was building toward something wonderful.  Her legs clamped together and rubbed each other.  Her butt and hips were thrashing about.  Her large chest was flopping around under her shirt.  And her shoulders she pushed as hard as she could into the pillow.  Everything was on fire with sensation.<br />
<br />
Then she drew in a sharp breath, held it a moment, and released it with a moan.  Her body slumped on to her bed.  Every part of her felt warm and tired.  She noticed as she drifted off to sleep that her lips were shrinking.</p>
