<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Janet&#39;s folks were out for the day, and, seeing as she was an only child, this meant that the two lovebirds were alone - and thus, more than able to allow Brad to make a full show of his body for her as he walked into her place. &quot;Whew...&quot; Brad whistled as he looked around, still impressed by the quite extensive pad Janet&#39;s parents had bought at a surprisingly low price, &quot;This place is a steal, you know that?&quot; He however didn&#39;t waste any more time, and before long he had stripped off his pants and boxers, standing in the middle of the living room naked, twirling his pants in one hand.<br />
<br />
A grin on his face as Janet approached him and very openly reached around to---ooh! She was getting grabby! Brad let out a quick little gasp as he felt her grope at his tight little bubble butt, &quot;You want me to shower or not? Because---touching me like that is a fast way to make sure I get plenty dirty some more here and now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know, I know,&quot; Janet responded, looking at that confident smirk and realizing her boyfriend really was enjoying this as much as she was, &quot;I just couldn&#39;t help but grab that nice little muscle ass. You&#39;re really feeling tight right now, Brad...did you workout glutes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things,&quot; Brad responded with a smile. &quot;I was a dynamo in there, Janet! I swear, I hadn&#39;t ever really worked out that much with the weights. Cardio had been my thing. But when I went in there I swear, it was prenatural! I just grabbed the weights and I knew what to do with them.&quot; Brad hadn&#39;t thought much about it when it was happening, he&#39;d been feeling too good at the time, too charged up, but now that he had the opportunity to share...well. He figured he should at least mention it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; Janet contemplated even as she continued letting herself indulge in the pleasure of a newly muscled up Brad, &quot;Well, you&#39;ve obviously reaped the benefits so far. I wonder why, though, it would---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As fascinating as this is,&quot; Brad chuckled somewhat nervously, looking down at his manhood, &quot;I&#39;m feeling really tempted to just---<i>fuck</i> again with you groping on me like this. I&#39;m still not used to how much testosterone this body&#39;s rife with. I&#39;ll be right back into the shower, and we can discuss this further afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet watched that tight derriere all the way up the stairs toward the bathroom, already contemplating what to do with this. She knew she should be trying to find out who exactly that name was aside from Vertael that Brad had heard... it might indicate there was a pattern to these changes. A basis that she might be able to identify... but at the same time, well. She was enjoying herself - and obviously so. She just leaned back, keen to enjoy the show - but also thinking how long she should keep off until Brad was good and wet. It...could give her time enough to contemplate.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
By the time Brad clambered into the shower, getting the water started up, he found himself staring at his body yet again. It was true - this wasn&#39;t some awesome dream. He really was every bit as buff as his girlfriend liked...though the bodybuilders who lined the magazines she collected were still larger than he was. It was an odd feeling. He was by far more muscular than he ever had been before, but it was like after all that, he was still feeling small in comparison. <br />
<br />
The water started off chilly, but before long it heated up - letting Brad coo a little bit as he felt the water caress his aching body...and flow over his sensitive, well formed manhood. It was a curious feeling, knowing how libidinous he was now - and how for now at least he was managing it. It did seem like there was...something about this body that really brought out that kind of feeling though. Brad even at his horniest phases of adolescence had never quite had a desire like this body possessed. Maybe it was his muscles somehow - getting bigger made him have more test? <br />
<br />
...<i>Though I&#39;m still not big enough.</i><br />
<br />
And for some reason he was now comparing his physique development to these muscle men as if he was one of them. Brad found some suitable Old Spice among the shampoos and body washes in the shower, and started lathering it into his hair. He noted as he did so that there was a slight bit more curl to it than what he remembered. Though that could be just his hair with this product and the sweat in mind. The young man found himself lathering up with body wash as well.<br />
<br />
He wanted to smell nice for his girl, and---oh, what was that? As Brad started washing his hair out, letting the shampoo rinse to the ground amidst the droplets from the shower, he heard the door to the shower room open. He smirked a little as he turned around, pretending not to hear anything. A few tell tale sounds of clothes hitting the floor - that obviously, she thought he would not hear.<br />
<br />
Then the shower door opened up, and Brad was joined in the shower by Janet. Her own sweat from their fuck session in the car being washed off in the course of joining him in there - though likely to be replaced. She pressed her voluminous breasts against his wide, toned back, and Brad moaned a little as she reached around and wordlessly started groping at and jerking his cock. It had been going down to half hard, but now it surged back to life and tumescent readiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do this and I don&#39;t think this shower will get me cleaner...&quot; Brad said followed by a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re already mostly clean,&quot; Janet whispered, still enjoying the feeling of her nude form against his hard muscles, &quot;I figure we can dirty you up a little more.&quot; Before long, she gave him the hint by several motions with her hands she wanted him to face her. And as he turned around, she was ready to give him a really nice surprise. The shower raining down on the crown of his head, letting him watch through the occasional interruption of a droplet cascading down...<br />
<br />
...As Janet knelt in front of him, teasing and massaging his thighs and quadriceps first before leaning in and taking his manhood into her mouth. As she bobbed up and down on it, she was rewarded by the sound of Brad gasping, almost bucking several times, and attempting to keep himself up on his feet by holding on to the wet walls of the shower area. Her mouth on his sensitive manhood was all that Brad had hoped it would be - she&#39;d never given him a blowjob when he was skinny...but now he was buff...!<br />
<br />
She had a lot to look upward towards in the midst of the activity. Brad&#39;s shoulders and chest flexed during the exertion of him holding himself up in the course of the oral pleasure he was receiving. His eyes shut hard and a big smile on his face. &quot;Aww....Ahh! Fuck yes! Fuck yes! Babe, you never went down on me before!&quot; And now Brad immediately knew what he wanted more of now.<br />
<br />
He was even beneficiary of further pleasure as Janet both began lightly massaging his balls, as well as using a single finger to rub against his taint - a curious little maneuver that left Brad quivering in pleasure. He didn&#39;t even know why that latter thing turned him on so much, but oh, it did, and he meant to let her know about that. Though she could probably guess going by the moans, groans and grunts forcing their way through the new minted muscle man&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m gonna---&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that, Brad managed to control himself just enough to get her, with a single tap from his hand against the glass of the shower area, to get off of him before things progressed too far. And just as she moved back, Brad let out a long series of grunts and then... &quot;I---Oh fuck, oh fuck oh fuck cumming...cumming hot and hard!&quot; The ejaculation splattered against the floor and left Brad feeling distinctly relieved - muscles relaxing as he pressed his back against the wall. Waiting till he was sure he could walk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for not forcing me to swallow, big guy.&quot; Janet said as she got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a brute, babe,&quot; Brad said with a degree of pride, &quot;I&#39;m not the kind of guy that&#39;d make his girlfriend do that.&quot; He did admit, he was not sure going into that if he was gonna be able to control himself that well. He just hoped going forward he could communicate something like that as well as he improvised in the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not,&quot; Janet kissed his cheek as she went to grab some towels - one for her, one for Brad. &quot;Now, let&#39;s get dry and dressed...I brought you some of my dad&#39;s clothes to be a loaner. Let&#39;s have some fun for however long we have alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Brad and Janet - after getting dressed and getting a little handsy in the course of getting dry beforehand - ended up settling in for a night of movies, food, and fun times. Brad found that even the polo shirt and pants borrowed from Janet&#39;s dad were a little tight on him. But then, a little tight looked pretty good on him. As Janet could attest.<br />
<br />
Janet it turned out had several sword and sandal movies collected as well, which usually involved some muscle man acting as Hercules / Herakles, and fighting various poorly formed monsters, other muscle men, and the machinations of some sort of villain of the hour. Some of the people involved being more recognizable than others, standing the test of time.<br />
<br />
For the most part, Brad found his fun in riffing on the predictable story beats and poorly done dialogue.<br />
<br />
He and Janet both settled into a routine. Brad would do the voice of any of the muscle men in the movie, and Janet did the voice of the various women who, through many plot contrivances, usually ended up as the love interests of these muscle men. And of course, the names were often more or less bastardized Greek names. Even when the movie used the Roman spelling of the Demigod&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh Vespera...my dear Vespera!&quot; Brad intoned, &quot;My sweltering pectorals flex with dismay at your capture by the fiendish Evilodes! I wish only to rescue you by the grace of mighty Zeus so I may flex my abs at the camera and have you run your hands on them as I brandish my sword upward at the sky!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh my dear Hercules!&quot; Janet matched him, &quot;Evilodes has randomly subjected me to poorly choreographed BDSM attacks! His minions haphazardly flail whips in my general direction, and I act like they hit me when they barely even reached where I was standing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THE FIEND!!&quot; Brad defiantly howled, managing to affect some measure of rage amidst quelling his uproarious laughter, trying not to break during the course of his performance. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t like the dialogue in the movie was much better than the caliber of the riffs the two young people were providing. At one point, both Brad and Janet failed to riff on anything involving &quot;the monster bear&quot; that the villain sicced on Hercules - obviously a man in a halloween costume with beady eyes and fluffy ears. Yet the actor behaved as if he was beset by a very real bear.<br />
<br />
Not even any special effects to try and make the bear anything but a ridiculous walking prop. The man inside the costume &quot;roared&quot;. It was really more like he <i>pronounced</i> roar using his mouth. Several times in fact. &quot;Roar!!&quot; The poor man who was probably never paid enough enunciated, &quot;ROAR!!!&quot; The only way it could be in any way less authentic would be if he intoned in a grizzly tone &quot;I...AM A BEAR!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Howling with laughter at the image of plastic claws somehow raking and producing cuts on Hercules&#39; mighty frame, Brad and Janet sat back and enjoyed the climax. The two couldn&#39;t wait to see how the mighty hero resolved the issue. The villain still stood back, making an absolutely ridiculous face as he watched his &quot;bear&quot; fight Hercules. <br />
<br />
As Hercules ultimately tossed the bear AT &quot;Evilodes&quot; and crushed him to death under the weight of what was obviously a stunt man in an even worse costume... Brad and Janet openly laughed and failed to mock any of the words said during and after the &quot;triumphant act&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think I could ever pull off something THAT ridiculous, do you?&quot; Brad asked with a grin and a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I dunno,&quot; Janet said, looking Brad over. &quot;If you keep on muscling up the way you are, I could definitely see it. You on there, making a movie with some goofball Italian...&quot; Though the two laughed, Brad was quiet afterwards as he contemplated. The guys in these movies were definitely not chosen for their acting aptitude, that was for sure. But he could recognize that they were probably - no, definitely - still in better shape than he was.<br />
<br />
Even in this moment, that weirdly competitive streak reared its head. As Brad watched the credits roll, he vaguely heard Janet get up and say, &quot;I&#39;m gonna make us some dinner...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make sure mine&#39;s low calorie high protein.&quot; Brad stated in a somewhat distracted manner. He needed to make sure he was strict with his diet now, though in a different way than usual... he didn&#39;t even hear the affirmative response. He was thinking of his next workout. His next trip to the gym. Even though the next day was Sunday, when he usually took a break day from much of anything...he was really feeling too enticed. He couldn&#39;t take the day off. Not when he had a body he needed to continue to develop.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow...&quot; Janet said as she brought out some food, and then quickly checked her phone. A quick and easy personal pizza, salad and leftover steak for her, and seasoned broccoli, chicken and oatmeal for her boyfriend. She seemed to be pretty interested in what she was seeing. Tilting her head and reading the whole message.<br />
<br />
Brad for his part was getting ready to dig in, already feeling pretty famished. He asked in the midst of eating some of his oatmeal, &quot;What? Some news?&quot; He tapped his spoon against the bowl, eagerly awaiting the news. <br />
<br />
&quot;On the backing and expertise of Grayson Everett, the school gym teacher...&quot; Janet stated, and then added, &quot;And former bodybuilder. I saw so. He was one of the &quot;also competed&quot; in the mass monster era. Handsome guy, but not my style. Just can&#39;t get past the GH Gut. Oh, going on...&quot; Janet then continued the news, &quot;Grayson Everett proposed the Mr. And Ms. Amberville Contest, which has been approved. Comprising students 17 and up, this bodybuilding contest has a 400 dollar prize from Mr. Everett&#39;s own pocket book. It will be conducted in four months time, to allow the students who want to take part to prepare for the contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad&#39;s eyes widened. The very word &quot;Contest&quot; seemed to set off an innate emotional and psychological reaction in him he barely understood, though one he got due to how competitive cross country was able to get. There was no question about it. He had to be a part of this. He had to <i>win</i> this. He wasn&#39;t gonna lose to some oversized jocks who&#39;d have to trim down to match him. Not when he&#39;d been muscled up to this extent. In a moment, that competitive urge Brad was already familiar with married his newly testosterone laden conceptions - and he was set on his path.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to know more and sign up for the Contest...&quot; Janet read aloud, not knowing about the determination her boyfriend now possessed - and that odd reaction to the competition or even just the notion of it, &quot;Sign ups begin on Monday and go through Friday, in the school gymnasium. We look forward to seeing the efforts of our student athletic population.&quot;<br />
<br />
The idea <i>also</i> excited Janet for obvious reasons. She wasn&#39;t sure if the men she&#39;d see in the course of it would match up well to her favorites, but she was more than willing to enjoy the procession of the eye candy men. &quot;You&#39;re...going to sign up for it, right Brad? I mean, I&#39;d love to see you in one of those tiny lycra speedos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I&#39;m gonna sign up for it, babe,&quot; Brad confidently smirked, &quot;And I am gonna win. I&#39;ll workout every day I can, one rest day a week allowed. I&#39;ll win that contest for you, and we can have a nice dinner that night.&quot; He intently started eating again - he&#39;d have to, after all, in order to get his diet right for this contest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muscle up for me, hunk.&quot; Janet said as the two started eating. She didn&#39;t know what Brad was already thinking of doing to try and solidify his lead...<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
By the time the date was over that night and Janet drove Brad home, they&#39;d had several more sloppy make outs after their dinner, and two more sexual trysts. The latter of which had to be cancelled at the middle mark due to Janet&#39;s parents opening the doors downstairs - leaving Brad blueballed but ultimately he understood why it had to happen. Though he didn&#39;t feel very comfortable at the time. Her parents always seemed to like Brad, and now they seemed even happier since it seemed their daughter was really enjoying the night.<br />
<br />
For now, her dad let Brad borrow the clothes while he waited on a wash of the clothes he&#39;d worked out in.<br />
<br />
Once Brad got inside his house and home, he could tell that everyone was probably already asleep. He slowly made his way up to his room, without turning on any lights, through just his memory of the locations and &quot;landmarks&quot; as it were. He didn&#39;t want to wake anybody up - getting to his room would be difficult in the dark, with all the lights off...<br />
<br />
However, doing so this way would make Brad&#39;s plan easier. His room was thankfully unmolested by any weird activities Ethan got up to, and there was no hint of his parents messing with the VHS tapes at all. He turned on the light by his bedside, and looked at his TV. Sitting there, innocuously, as if it didn&#39;t have some sort of weird little VHS tape inside that had turned Brad muscular and strong...but as he came to realize, not quite muscular enough.<br />
<br />
He needed to really push through on this contest. Show his girlfriend he was every bit her bodybuilder boyfriend. He needed to get bigger. Get stronger. And when he won, she&#39;d stride out and the two of them would ride off to enjoy their dinner. And then they&#39;d have a night to themselves where a powerfully muscled Brad would fuck her until the lights started to shine the next morning. Just imagining himself in such a state made Brad grin and palm at his manhood - resuscitating from getting denied due to parental return.<br />
<br />
Ohh yeah, this body was made for fun times and lifting prowess. But if this body was so good...well, it merited the question. How good would any follow up body made by progressing on the &quot;path&quot; or whatever be? If he&#39;d gotten results this good...well. He needed to see what came next. Especially in the context of the contest. Just thinking about it both got him excited and made him feel a sense of competitive single minded drive he&#39;d only ever encountered in the really high up parts of high school track and field.<br />
<br />
Before long, Brad stepped, one foot after the other, slow and steady - right toward the TV. And as he turned it on, and subsequently turned on the VHS player, he plopped down on his bed and eagerly awaited...<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t have to wait long for Vertael.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back, Fitness Traveler, to the Dream Halls...&quot; The androgynous voice spoke as Brad felt the sensation that he remembered from last time slow to return...but when it did, it returned with a vengeance. He gulped and almost pumped his hips right into it. Feeling almost like the voice this time was...was fellating him somehow. And with his recent discoveries of himself, he found that was quite a weakness of his. &quot;I am your lovely host, Vertael...&quot;<br />
<br />
While before he was unable to move, this time he was only just barely able to move enough to get his girlfriend&#39;s dad&#39;s clothes off of him in time. It was still however like he was pushing against something that weighed down on him - but now, it was more like it was just resistance rather than an all powerful weight. &quot;Mm--guhh...&quot; Brad moaned as he finally couldn&#39;t take it any more.<br />
<br />
With how overcharged he was...?<br />
<br />
Yeah, he came right into his boxers. <br />
<br />
Muscles tensing and feeling his glutes flex, Brad involuntarily found his hips pumping into the air as he watched the stain at the front of his boxers grow larger and larger, leaking as he sat there on the edge of his bed. &quot;You desire for strength, size, masculine beauty and you find in yourself this competitive urge. The desire that marks your path, the push toward your aesthetic need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The muscle, the development and the drive...you will continue down the path of one Bob Paris, with all that...eventually brings~!&quot; The voice seemed to be teasing him - maddeningly so, as it kept on stroking somehow at him, even after he had cum just moments ago. Didn&#39;t this voice ever hear of a fucking refractory period? Even with how fast Brad could usually get it back up, he sometimes had his limits - at least so far. <br />
<br />
And again that name, purred into his ear by that seductive voice. Yes...that was a name that his girlfriend spoke of. Some guy he remembered she fawned over. Usually with some caveat though. There was something up... but Brad right now couldn&#39;t remember for the life of him what. The world was swirling in illusion. He found himself transported not to the school gym this time...<br />
<br />
But to the gym he had visited in the course of his day, before the rampant sex he had enjoyed with Janet. Seeing himself lifting in there, muscles tight and twinging and---and growing? He couldn&#39;t tell. The various mirrors were all so very fogged up. He could barely see who he was in those mirrors. Was he Bradley DiLaurentis? Or was he not? He was increasingly feeling a strange sense of dissociation. A strange sense of disconnect. <br />
<br />
But if he wasn&#39;t Bradley DiLaurentis in this dream...who was he?<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
When Brad awoke the next morning, Sunday bright and early, he almost threw himself out of bed, eager to see what had become of himself. He found that he was now dressed in a new pair of boxers, and had apparently somehow ended up resting in his bed. The cum-stained boxers from last night were folded into his dirty clothes pile.<br />
<br />
What Brad saw almost made him drool at the sheer sight of himself. While his biceps hadn&#39;t gotten that much bigger, just by a few inches, everything else was progressing amazingly. Perfectly proportioned lats keeping pace with broad, well rounded shoulders that tapered into biceps and triceps that kept a pace with each other. Even his forearms seemed a bit broader and stronger this morning.<br />
<br />
Brad flexed his quadricep and watched the muscle display itself for him, grinning at how good it looked. The separation at the thigh and---ohh fuck, at the ass...it was so good! He even saw a good bit of development at his calf! <br />
<br />
But the thing that really grabbed his attention was his pectoral shelf and his abdominals. The former had developed broader, stronger, pushed out a bit more. The upper, middle and lower chest were not lacking for development in any area, and attested to even splits of chest workouts that Brad found himself recalling - even as he had never actually done those workouts before. The latter, his abs, seemed tighter, stronger, and pushed out on his stomach more, obliques etched in and complimenting the beauty of his abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear I&#39;ve never been this narcissistic before...&quot; Brad playfully chided himself. Fuck. Even his voice sounded a bit deeper today. Looking at his face, Brad bit his lip lightly - he could see he looked a little broader. Stronger features. Still boyishly handsome, but with more masculine looks. A grin almost completely sold a certain tendency.<br />
<br />
He ran his hand through his hair, noting the hair seemed thicker - again - and his curls seemed more obvious. &quot;And I never had curly hair before...&quot; The muscle man crossed his arms in front of his chest, contemplating. He knew what he wanted to do - immediately get dressed in a tank top and pump iron - but he also knew he should probably report what he&#39;d done and how far he&#39;d advanced to Janet. <br />
<br />
A lascivious smile graced his face.<br />
<br />
