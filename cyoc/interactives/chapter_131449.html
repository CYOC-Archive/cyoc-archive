<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric Anderson waited until after Julie Stovall closed the front door of her house before he turned around to walk home.<br />
His body was on &quot;autopilot&quot;, just putting one foot in front of another to travel along a familiar route to a well visited destination, but his mind was far away, thinking some very deep thoughts.<br />
<i>I love Julie. I became a were-mer to be with her. We&#39;re destined soul mates. Love At First Sight and Happily Forever After are proven, scientific concepts, at least as far as were-mers are concerned, so why do I feel frightened by Arthur Curtis being in her life?</i><br />
<i>Julie loves me. She wasn&#39;t ignoring me. Right? It&#39;s just a homework assignment Julie&#39;s wrapped up in, along with wondering if her mom&#39;s pregnant or not. So what if Arthur is part of that homework? It&#39;s not like she&#39;s interested in him when we&#39;re engaged, let alone that Curtis would try to steal her from me. Would he?</i><br />
He would not admit it, but Eric was starting to feel like his old, insecure self again.<br />
The Eric Anderson from Minnesota who was always being picked on by his &quot;peers&quot; for being such an intelligent kid while girls his own age wouldn&#39;t give him the time of day unless they needed help with their homework to prevent getting a failing grade and the parental consequences that arose from that.<br />
So it came as a total surprise to Eric when, as he approached the corner of Wood and Oak, to hear a sultry female voice ask, &quot;How&#39;s it going handsome?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked around and saw that the only person outside (other than himself) was a teenage female leaning against a pick up truck parked on the other side of the T intersection of Wood and Oak.<br />
The shoulder length black haired beauty smiled at him as she straightened up and crossed Wood to approach him.<br />
As she grew closer, Eric saw she was a head taller than him and obviously a were, for she had a voluptuous figure that didn&#39;t come naturally to a normal human being her age. Of course, the tight bluejeans and t-shirt she had on didn&#39;t help hide her curves either.<br />
Other than that and the fact that he vaguely recalled seeing in the hallways of Moon Lake High occasionally, that was all Eric could swear to about the woman.<br />
While a were-mer&#39;s unique senses were better underwater than on dry land, even up close Eric couldn&#39;t tell exactly what species she was. Part of her smelled like werewolf, akin to his brother and other lupines. Yet there was also a hint of werecat like the Twists, along with something else he couldn&#39;t identify.<br />
Having been a were-mer less than a month, Eric just chalked not being able to identify her species to his inexperience as the girl held out her hand and said, &quot;Hi. I&#39;m Spencer Lawson*.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being polite, Eric held out his hand and returned the handshake, but curious, asked, &quot;Is that Spencer with a C or an extra S?&quot;<br />
&quot;C. My folks were hoping for a boy and planned to name me after dad&#39;s brother, who died in the line of duty. But apparently, I was bashful when it came to sonograms, and totally surprised everyone upon arrival,&quot; she explained with a grin. &quot;Yet they didn&#39;t want to waste the name so...&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. I&#39;m Eric Anderson,&quot; he replied.<br />
&quot;You live around here?&quot; asked Spencer. <i>Anderson? If it&#39;s the same family I&#39;ve heard about since we moved back here...</i><br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
&quot;Need a lift?&quot; she asked, pointing to her pickup.<br />
&quot;No thanks. I can walk.&quot; Eric didn&#39;t notice Spencer giving him a quick sniff to confirm he was a were-merman. Yet she also realized that if this boy was part of that family, then he was only a Freshman. <i>No wonder I don&#39;t have him in any of my classes,</i> realized the Sophomore.<br />
<i>Okay. So what do I do now? Despite being incredibly horny right now and in need of a good fuck, I just can&#39;t come right out and ask him for sex, can I?</i><br />
&quot;So. My family used to live in Moon Lake, until my dad enlisted after 9-11**,&quot; began Spencer. &quot;I was still an infant when we started moving from one military base to another. But it was reaching the point where he had to retire or someone might figure out there was something <i>special</i> about him that would eventually lead to discovering that weres existed. So he left the SEALS with a full honorable discharge and we moved back here to Moon Lake. My folks say the place hasn&#39;t changed much since they left, but it&#39;s all new to me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too. My family just moved here before the start of the new school year,&quot; replied Eric.<br />
&quot;Well then. Would you like to show a lady around?&quot; asked Spencer.<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t,&quot; said Eric. &quot;Too much homework to do today.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know the feeling. What are you? A Freshman?&quot;<br />
Eric just nodded his head affirmatively, confirming Spencer&#39;s suspicions.<br />
&quot;Well, I can assure you it isn&#39;t any easier as a Sophomore. So, maybe we can hang out sometime and—&quot;<br />
Whatever Spencer was about to say was lost as her cellphone began to ring.<br />
Reluctantly, she pulled it out of the back of her bluejeans pocket and answered it.<br />
After a couple of &quot;Un-huhs&quot; and &quot;Okays&quot;, Spencer said, &quot;I&#39;ll be home soon Mom,&quot; before hanging up.<br />
&quot;Well, guess that&#39;s it for now,&quot; she said, shrugging her shoulders. &quot;But it was very nice meeting you Eric. See you around school?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Eric said to be polite.<br />
Spencer started to turn around to walk back to her pickup truck, but then stopped and faced Eric again.<br />
&quot;You know, for were-mer, you&#39;re quite handsome.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Eric, as he started blushing at the comment. Something which didn&#39;t go unnoticed by Spencer.<br />
&quot;And modest too. That&#39;s quite attractive in a guy,&quot; Spencer added with a smile.<br />
Then, without any advance warning, Spencer pulled Eric close to her.<br />
Their chests mashed together and, having experienced physical sex with Julie, Eric realized that Spencer was not only going braless under her t-shirt, but that the hard nipples of her breasts were rubbing against his body.<br />
But that was a moot point compared to the fact that Spencer was giving him a very passionate French Kiss, as her tongue slipped between his lips and briefly ran along Eric&#39;s inner mouth.<br />
<br />
Eric never returned the kiss, but he was seriously caught off guard by Spencer&#39;s actions. All he could do was just stand there as their lips parted and she started to walk away.<br />
&quot;Mom always says to leave a man wanting more, and I definitely want to see you again Eric Anderson. Take care.&quot;<br />
With that, Spencer Lawson got back into her pickup truck and, after fastening her seat belt and starting the vehicle, made what might of been an illegal U-Turn to go back up Wood Street the way she came.<br />
Eric just stood there on the sidewalk, staring until Spencer&#39;s truck was no longer in sight.<br />
It was only after he came back to his senses that he realized what Spencer knew from the moment she started kissing him.<br />
Eric Anderson had one hell of an erection that was threatening to burst out of his pants!<br />

*Yes folks, this is the Earth 1 version of the character making her series debut. On Earth 2 (which has a totally different continuity than all our Earth 1 adventures), the hybrid were-wolf-cat-panthress is in a permanent, polygamous relationship with fellow werepanther Eric Anderson and werepanthress Frieda Knight.<br />
**Based upon the date of the Moon Lake saga&#39;s very first post, it is November 2, 2015 to everyone on Earth 1.—tmw.</p>
