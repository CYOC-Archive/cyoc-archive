<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>You enjoyed the rest of the show even though you were a little girl now. You hoped Morpho would be able to explain what had 
happened. He had changed you into a little girl so he should be able to change you back. Will he change you back though? You begin 
to think that he purposely left you like this for some odd reason. Maybe Mark and Linda were married and they wanted a daughter but 
couldn't have children of their own. Why change you though? As you thought about it they probably couldn't adopt a girl being assistants 
in a magic show.</p>
<p>Now you were in Morpho's bus with Mark and Linda. You weren't surprised to see that inside it was as big as a large house. Linda 
took you up to a room that she said was your's now and helped you out of your costume. Now you were in a pair of jeans, a pink tee, 
and a pair of sandals sitting in what was the family room waiting for Morpho to come in and explain. It wasn't long before he did come in 
but you were surprised to see Janet and her mother come in with him.</p>
<p>"Thank you for giving me a job and us a place to stay Michael," Janet's mom said.</p>
<p>"I couldn't do anything less for the woman I love," Morpho said smiling. He got down on one knee and brought out a ring asking, 
"Will you marry me Sandy?"</p>
<p>Sandy gave a little squeal and said, "Yes I'll marry you Michael. I've been waiting for you to ask me."</p>
<p>Morpho put the ring on Sandy's finger and then kissed her for several moments. When he broke the kiss he out, "We're ready to go 
Henry."</p>
<p>"Sure thing," an unseen Henry called back.</p>
<p>You could feel when the bus started to move and Morpho, Sandy, and Janet came over to sit down with Janet sitting next to you. 
Janet was so excited that she could hardly sit still. Morpho looked at you with a serious look on his face and said, "First thing I want to 
tell you is that Morpho is my stage name. When we're not performing or doing anything for which I need to be Morpho I want you to call 
me Uncle Mike."</p>
<p>"Why Uncle Mike?" you asked thinking that you had been right about Mark and Linda wanting a daughter.</p>
<p>"Because Mark is my brother and you're his and Linda's daughter now," Mike said looking down.</p>
<p>"So you destroyed my life just so they could have a daughter," you accused angrily.</p>
<p>"That was never my intention," Mike said appalled at the idea. "I don't use my magic to permanently change someone who doesn't 
deserve it."</p>
<p>"Then change me back," you demanded.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry but I can't," Mike said sadly. Before you can ask why he continued, "When I had told you that I was hundreds of years old 
and you said that if I was then you were a little girl you tapped into some magic to make a magical contract."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute I don't know any magic," you said shaking your head.</p>
<p>"You may not know any magic yet but you did tap into it," Mike said with a sigh. "From that moment on you were going to become a 
little girl no matter if I transformed you or not. If I had known this would happen I wouldn't have selected you to come up on stage. I am 
sorry that your life was ruined and I'll do what I can to make your new life the best it can be. I'll also teach you magic."</p>
<p>You sigh and ask, "So I can't go back to my old life?" You remembered the surprised look on his face when he opened the cabinet 
to find that you were still a little girl and the surprised look on his face when he made the man into a figurine. The two were different and 
you felt that the first was genuine so he hadn't expected you to be a little girl when he opened the cabinet.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not," Mike said sadly.</p>
<p>You had expected him to say that and you sighed saying, "Well maybe it won't be so bad."</p>
<p>Linda placed a hand on your shoulder and said, "It won't be. I was a man before too but unlike you I said if Mike was hundreds of 
years old then I was a woman. At least you get to grow up into a woman gradually whereas I was thrust into being a woman."</p>
<p>"She may not grow up," Mike said sighing. "It depends on how the magic interprets the wording."</p>
<p>"I just said that if you were hundreds of years old then I was a little girl," you said not understanding what Mike was saying.</p>
<p>"That's the problem," Mike said looking thoughtful. "All you said was that you'd be a little girl. That can be interpreted as being a little 
girl forever or it can be interpreted as becoming a little girl and growing normally."</p>
<p>You groaned as the realization that you may be a little girl forever sank in. "If only that man hadn't given me the ticket none of this 
would have happened," you said leaning back into the couch.</p>
<p>"Was this man bald and wearing a light blue tuxedo and white gloves?" Linda asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah," you said confused.</p>
<p>"This is the second time he's given someone a ticket to the show," Linda said looking at Mike.</p>
<p>"The second that we know of," Mike said shaking his head. "He may have given others tickets and they either didn't come  up on 
stage or the didn't create a magical contract."</p>
<p>"Why does he give the tickets out?" Sandy asked.</p>
<p>"We can't really know but we can guess," Mike said. "He may just like trying to ruin people's lives."</p>
<p>"Well we'll have to wait and see what he wants," Mark said hugging Linda. "Right now I think it's time to eat supper."</p></p>
