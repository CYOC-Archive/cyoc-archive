<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The grin on Nicky’s face relaxed a little and said “the next part is not as flashy as what we just put on you but you differently need them, they are kinda like reindeer trademarks”. Then girl finally stopped stroking Jen’s tail so they can get the next part done faster. The three girls ran off to another closet and disappeared.<br />
<br />
Jen didn’t even notice Nicky had moved to the back of her until she felt Nicky tighten some straps, then adjusted a couple finally she tightened the two straps that were around her pussy and said those girls need to learn how to properly tighten a harness. Moving back in front of Jen she started to admire their handy work. Jen was so beat red from what she was wearing, looking down she looked at her bare breasts then running a hand down to her pussy she felt that the straps weren’t too tight but they were still tight for her liking.<br />
Finally she saw the girls return from the closet as they got closer Jen started to hear the sound of bells. Knowing that that was now her fate she just accepted it. One walked behind Jen and slung a leather choker around her neck she heard the jingle of the bells on it as it went around her. It was like a collar she felt it get tighter around her neck then heard the fumbling with a clasp. Before the girl walked over to Jens legs she pulled on two rings that were on the back of the collar jerking Jens head around. The other girls were attaching one to each wrist these ones just had bells though. And then the girl at Jens feet attached one to each ankle.<br />
<br />
Finally the girls were finished with her harness, Nicky told them to remember to check the tightness of the harness before they go get the bells Jen’s harness was still a little loose in some arias. The girls in sync said “yes ma’am”. Nicky walked behind Jen and checked her choker. Then walked back in front of Jen and said “looking sexy now Mrs. Head reindeer. But now you are done so go to your next class.” Jen looked at Nicky and said “you mean lunch right?” Nicky said “no you were not behaving yourself so it took too long you missed lunch.” With that Jen was rushed out of the room.<br />
<br />
Now standing in the hallway she hit the wall irritated by the bells chiming as she hit the wall. She heard some laughter from behind her and turned around to see Kyle. He walked up to Jen and asked “how do you like your new harness?” she looked at him not wanting to show the embarrassment that she truly felt she said” it is nice going to be a little drafty but it should cut down on turbulence so that someone doesn’t accidentally fall out of his sleigh.” With this he started to laugh and stated “yes that would be a bad thing wouldn’t It.” just then a girl in a skimpy red outfit ran up from behind Jen and dove at Kyle hugging him, she then attached herself to his left arm. Guessing that this was the new soon to Mrs. Clause, Jen looked her over she was wearing a leopard print Santa hat with ginger red hair a cute face. Looking at her dress it was a sleeveless tube dress separating the top and the bottom was a shiny black belt just under her ample breasts. Looking further down the dress spreads out a little so it is not so constricting. And at the bottom of the dress it was fitted with snow white fur. Her socks came up to about her knees and had alternating stripes of green and white. Leading down to some shiny high heels.<br />
<br />
The girl looked at Jen and said”  ohh you must be the head reindeer, now don’t you look sooo cute in your harness.” Jen just smiled at her and walked away from them heading to her next class bells chiming all the while she walked. Glancing at the girls face as she walked by the girl looked at Kyle and asked” was it something I said?”<br />
<br />
Jen thought about what her next class was her stomach started to growl as now she has missed two meals and was really hungry. Then she remembered it was history with Mr. Levvery. As she walked in the classroom something looked weird the class was full of people she did not recognize, as she scanned the room she saw the other cheerleaders lounging on a bunch of pillows in the front. They waved her over smiling at her new harness. Jen sheepishly walked over to the other cheerleaders. As she walked past all the rows all the students stopped what they were doing to look at Jen. She noticed that in that room all the cheerleaders were there. All in different stages of being reindeer girls. As she got up to the front and she lounged down there with them. A couple minutes later Mr. Levvery quieted the room down and said that today in reindeer care 101 you freshmen are going to get to choose your reindeer that you will be working with. “Now there are nine lovely ladies” gesturing to the reindeers. So there will be two people per reindeer. It is your job to make sure that your reindeer is ready you will learn everything from polish their antlers to learning there sensitive spots such as their tails. Calling Jen to the front of the class he says “reindeer girls get timid in front of big crowds pointing to Jen see she sees you guys and is starting to shake. But a simple stroke of her tail.” He starts to stroke her tail slowly and she starts to relax more and more.<br />
<br />
Now, today we will dish out these ladies to groups of two let’s start with Jen seeing as she is already up here so who want her.<br />
<br />
Quickly hands were raised and Mr. Levvery picked out two and asked them to escort her to a spot she will be comfortable. The two got up and walked up to Jen as they neared she noticed how short they looked. They wrapped their hands around Jens waist and started to guide her to a stack of pillows. They sat down giving her the pillows and started to introduce themselves.<br />
<br />
The first to introduce herself was a girl who when trying to say her name kept messing up she said “my name is jjjjii- jiiill- “ and the last time it comes out as “ jjjingle”. The second was a boy that introduced himself by saying “I am luuuccc- luuuucc” then finally said “lluucky”. They both seemed to have trouble saying their names Jen just assumed that it was the curse. They both were really shy they could barely talk in the presence of Jen. When all the reindeer girls were assigned there two people and Jen, lucky and jingle had gotten to know a little more about each other. Mr. Levvery called the class to pay attention and wrote the lesson on the board that they would be learning today. And it was...</p>
