<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Supper at the Anderson household was similar to that of breakfast at the Lawson. The only difference is the amount of people at the table and time of day. With the re-heated leftovers all fixed themselves a plate full of scrambled eggs bacon, some sausage links cut up and mixed with the hash browns and the left over steaks cut up into strips. The pemeal bacon has all eaten earlier, but no one minded; there was plenty for all six to enjoy.<br />
<br />
With Eric, Spencer and Frieda each enjoy their small meal and spoon feeding each other in between fits of giggles; Nate merely wolfed down his as a form of steak and egg sandwich. Excusing himself he got up and heads out the door. Hoping to get some fresh air he runs into the forest under the dark sky; quickly sheading his clothes and shifting into his fursona and disappears into the darkening woods. <br />
<br />
William and Martha who were at the same table with Eric and his lovers, just quietly ate; stealing glances at each other. Despite their intense out of passion at the Lawson’s it was clear they were looking at having another go. But with Eric, Spencer and Frieda already calling dibs on the rec room; they decided to pay the Twists a visit. Finishing their meal, Martha and William smile knowing what the three teenage weres are about to do; they put on some shoes, a light coat and walk next door.<br />
<br />
The three remaining weres make a mad dash down to the soundproof rec room. Spencer and Frieda fumble to take off their clothes and shift into their fursonas; Eric just grins and watches. After the two are done, they turn to see Eric still fully clothed; still smiling he shifts into his white were-panther fursona, causing the clothes he is wearing to burst. Using his clawed hands he rips off the remnants displaying his fully erect feline cock for both lustful girls to see.<br />
<br />
Eric twitching his feline tail tenses up readying to pounce; both Spencer and Frieda not sure what is about to happen assume a defensive stance. Suddenly Eric moves faster than he thought possible and tackles both girls; purring in pleasure he uses his rough feline like tongue to tickle and stimulate Frieda’s nipples. Spencer pouting that Frieda is getting first dibs, suddenly feels several clawed fingers teasing her sex. Looking down to see Eric is not ignoring her she purrs, pleased that Eric wants her as much as he wants Frieda.<br />
“Go on,” Spencer purrs; “show Frieda how you can rock her world.”<br />
<br />
Eric grins. He stops pleasuring Frieda breasts and spreads her legs; exposing her eager lips. Growling in pleasure he guides his member into Frieda; pushing against her lubricated folds he starts pulling out, the fleshy barbs digging into Frieda’s tunnel.<br />
“Ahhhhhh,” Frieda gasps as she feels her first orgasms hit her; “do that again.”<br />
Eric grins, pushing back in he pulls out; causing Frieda to moan in pleasure again. Eric pushes back in a then pulls out; repeating the process over and over and increasing in speed. Frieda is clearly blown away with the pleasure she is getting from Eric, With her eyes glazed over as her body is rocked with multiple orgasms, all she can do is instinctively buck her hips in unison. Eric sensing this increases his pace, thrusting harder and faster; his own orgasm beginning to build as he feel his balls churning, creating a large batch of baby making juice.<br />
<br />
Frieda is in a state of bliss, becoming numb from the barbs all over Eric’s penis she feels her vaginal muscles start to tense; trying to lock Eric in. Another orgasm starts to build as Eric starts to grunt as he feels her clamping down. Feeling his rod twitch Eric growls as he lets loose a stream of seed into Frieda’s eager womb. Her own body, sensing the thick ropey jets spurt in her causes Frieda own body to shudder as another orgasm steam rolls over her.<br />
<br />
Eric pulls out as he finishes spilling his load in Frieda; Looking at her he see her enjoying the moment as her orgasm lingers. Spencer deciding to add to Frieda’s enjoyment; pushes her maw in Frieda’s sex, leaking Eric’s spunk as well as Frieda’s own and starts sampling the their combined juices. Eric sitting next to Frieda as she moans at the continued pleasure; he gently strokes her head watching her eyes flutter.<br />
“Frieda, what color are your eyes, supposed to be,” He asks.<br />
“Mhhhh,” Frieda moans enjoying Spencer’s tongue action within her; “Amber.”<br />
“Now they are green,” Eric looking mildly concerned.<br />
Spencer stops what she is doing to view Frieda’s eyes herself; “Eric’s right. They are as green as his eyes. And they look quite striking combined with your grey fur.”<br />
<br />
Spencer going back to tonguing Frieda’s sex assumes a sixty nine position with her. Eric seeing this, gets him aroused; before Frieda can insert her own tongue in spencer, Eric mounts her and plunges his member in Spencer. This earns him a loud gasp from Spencer as she starts thrusting in and out of her. Frieda not wanting to waste a chance to pleasure Eric; uses her tongue to tickle his furry balls as he thrusts in and out of Spencer in wild abandon.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck I can feel myself coming,” Eric growls.<br />
“Me to,” Spencer spasming with each time Eric’s barbs dig into her tunnel.<br />
“Keep up the tongue action Spencer,” Frieda sighing; “Let’s all cum at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
Each purr and growl with renewed vigor as their own individual climaxes bubble and push forth; Eric grunting as he is the first go, spills his load into Spencer. Spencer feeling this shudders with her own orgasm as she accidentally nips Frieda’s clitoris. Frieda yowls as she feels Spencer’s love bite and shudders once again as her own orgasm race through her.<br />
<br />
Both Spencer and Eric collapse upon each other and Frieda; slowly disentangling from each other, Frieda gets a look at Spencer’s eyes; they are also a vivid shade of green. During their love making; a deep unbreakable bond formed. Each partner’s eye matching the shade of Eric’s as he embraces both of them. Both content with in Eric’s loving embrace, all three drift off to sleep enjoying the afterglow from their combined coupling. Frieda the last to fall asleep just mumbles &quot;yin, yang and whole;&quot; referencing their nicknames respectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
Authors note: In Moon Lake 1 Eric&#39;s eyes changed to a deep vivid blue when he and Julie Stovall became true lovers. In Moon Lake 3 this potential bond was shattered when Eric&#39; father died at the hands of the rogue were-vixen Yevette and eric became a werewolf to one day join the police force. While all moon lake story lines describe were-foxes having a deep bond with their partners; who is to say that such a deep level of love can not exist for the various other were species here in Moon Lake 2.</p>
