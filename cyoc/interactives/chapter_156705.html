<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It happened on a day like any other. The Miller family was spread about their various activities: Cindy is working hard at the office. Her kids, Jessica, June, Nicole, and Daniel were at school. Her oldest daughter Rebecca is on vacation. <br />
<br />
***<br />
***<br />
<br />
The guys’s locker room was full of raucous voices before swim class. Young men were milling about in their swim suits and a few cocky ones had decided to shuck them off for the showers. They were snapping towels at each other in the open showers and making lewd jokes. Others were over at the lockers changing out of their clothing and into their swimsuits. It was a boisterous mood. And then it abruptly went silent. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Next door, the sessions in the pool and the gym were finishing up. In the gym, they were wrapping up their volleyball game. Both teams were running around to hit the balls and toss them back over the net. James jumped up and spiked the ball toward Michael who was gearing up to hit it back. Then it was if they winked out of existence. Their clothing fluttered to the ground. Momentum separated James’ gym shirt, underwear and gym shorts and flung them into the net. The ball continued to fly through the air and bounced off the pile of Michael’s clothing. <br />
<br />
The girls looked around. All of the guys were gone. All that remained was their piles of clothing. <br />
<br />
Amy walked up to the net while Amanda walked over to Michael’s clothing. Amanda cautiously nudged it with her toe. Amy leaned in to look at the thing stuck in the net. Other girls were looking at the piles of clothing. <br />
<br />
Amanda looked through the sweaty boxer-briefs and held up an object, “They’ve been turned into… dicks? That’s gross.” The girls started exclaiming in surprise, some holding up the floppy penises from the piles of clothing for the others to see. Amy rescued James’ dick from being tangled in the volleyball net and held it up. The girls started rifling through the clothes to rescue the guys. <br />
<br />
A girl winced as she fished a skinny floppy, circumcised penis out of a smelly tennis shoe. She asked it “are you alright?” while holding it up to her face.  Jody found one wedged between the volleyballs and basketballs in the ball bucket. There was always a pile of empty clothes nearby. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
In the pool the class was partially lined up to spring off the diving board. A few were sitting on the benches lining the steamed room. Others were paddling around the shallow end after having dived. The next moment, there were a bunch of men’s swim suits floating in the pool. After a moment, all of the girls’ realized and stopped splashing. <br />
<br />
“What’s that floating? It’s a… Aaaaah!” screamed a girl in the pool. There was a long, dark-skinned penis floating the pool, its balls lazily floating behind it. Other dicks and swimsuits bobbed up slowly after water smacked to fill the empty space where the guys had been an instant before. There were swimsuits and dicks on the warm tile floor, sprawled out in the humidity with the nuts stretched away from the shafts. <br />
<br />
One girl exclaimed, “Jeremy just dove and… disappeared! His cock just hit the pool!” <br />
<br />
Another girl shouted, “Can he breathe?” and jumped into the pool.<br />
<br />
“They seem to float.” said another girl. Still they fished the dicks out of the water and bundled them on a towel just in case.  <br />
<br />
A girl walked over to the bench and found a penis lying nestled in a towel. Unlike the other floppy dicks, this one was straight and stiff. “This perve was using the towel to hide it,” she muttered to herself “probably checking out our bikinis.” <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
There was a crack in the wall between the women’s locker room and the men’s. The girls knew about it and hung a coat over it to keep anybody from looking through at them. They giggled, “let’s have a look at the sausage factory!” cried Susan to the rowdy crowd. She was sweet on Jamal and wanted to see the goods. A number of girls gathered around while she removed the coat and peered through the crack. “I don’t see anybody…” she pressed her eyes closer and looked back at the group. “Could they really be done already?” Last week this had rewarded them with an eyeful of the uknowing Steven’s more-than-ample endowment as he happened to slip off his boxer-briefs moments as they looked through. It had been just inches in front of the unseen viewers. Susan gave up, “There’s nobody there.” <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
In the gym, the girls were speculating about what had happened. “Do you think it hurt when they fell to the ground?” asked Jody “That’s what happened, right? They became their dicks and the rest of them disappeared? And then they fell and or if they were running they continued to move forward…”<br />
<br />
“Or maybe they’re somewhere else and these are just their dicks? But they seem… alive.”<br />
<br />
“Men. Always thinking with their dicks. That’s probably all they are now.” <br />
<br />
“They seem happy.” All the rough handling had caused some of the penises to get long and stiff, the balls drawing in toward the shaft. They throbbed as if purring. <br />
<br />
“How widespread do you think this is?”   A crowd of dressed girls and girls in swimsuits and towels poured out of the women’s locker room. One of them held a towel. She unwrapped it on the floor, exposing a nest of a dozen happy dicks of all different shapes, colours, and sizes. Most of them had swollen with the contact of strange flesh against them, not knowing they were former friends and teammates. <br />
“Has anybody checked the locker rooms?” said Jessica, “they should be getting ready for the next swim class.” The girls followed Jessica’s lead towards the men’s locker room. There were two piles of clothing in the locker room with their accompanying phalluses inside. A towel draped out of the locker. Inside the locker in a duffel bag was the penis. When they entered the showers -- the place of the young women’s dreams -- they found the water still running. Most of the dicks on the floor had no swim suits with them. Three of them had been pushed by the shower jets to be nested together above the drain. They were loose and floppy in the warm water. <br />
<br />
They heard a sink turn on and rushed to the bathroom. “Look what I found in the urinal” said a girl, gingerly holding the tip of the dick and running it under the water. She flicked some soap at it. <br />
<br />
They gathered up the remnants of the next swim class and brought all the guys into the gym. <br />
<br />
“Hold it everybody!” shouted Jessica. “Does everybody know whose they picked up?” The girls looked around at each other. Amanda and Amy shouted yes and held up James and Michael by their tips, but most of the other girls’ eyes widened. If this was widespread, it was going to be difficult to figure who was who. <br />
<br />
“Oh fuck.” said Jessica. “Hmm…. Well we know who was in the swim class. Let’s keep those separate. Somebody gather up all the photo IDs in the locker room.” A girl fetched them. Jessica bit her lip, “Well simple now, right? Just match them to their owner.”<br />
<br />
“How do we do that?” <br />
<br />
“Um… well there’s skin colour? Pube colour?” <br />
<br />
“Funny isn’t it. These were all guys with their hopes and dreams and drives, and now… reduced to this. Kind of pathetic isn’t it? I wonder if they’re aware? I wonder what they’re thinking? Or if they’re just …happy little dicks?” <br />
<br />
***<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jessica’s sister, June, was in the science classroom at the other end of the school. The class was working on various science assignments scattered throughout the room. She laughed as Terrence made a goofy show of putting on the face mask and asking her for the scalpel. The classroom buzzed with life.  <br />
<br />
And then the classroom was quiet. Terrence had disappeared. <br />
<br />
There was a pile of clothes on the floor. She leaned closer to the tray with the dead frog on it. <br />
<br />
“Ew.” There was a penis lying next to the frog. “Terrence?”<br />
<br />
A penis went flying through the air, wobbling as it rotated. <br />
<br />
“Sorry!” called a girl. “Fred was working on the catapult. Um… was that his dick?”<br />
<br />
The girls looked at each other. All the guys had disappeared. <br />
<br />
“Oh shit.” The guys who were working on a chemistry project were looking rough. One penis was headfirst in a beaker tube, with the balls hanging over the side, keeping it from slipping all the way in. Another had fallen into a recent chemical reaction and was floating in the liquid, having turned bright purple. <br />
<br />
Nearby there was a penis next to the static electric generator, getting shocked over and over. It was rigid and a rope of cum stretched over the lab table from its tip. <br />
<br />
At the bio-sciences corner, some guy’s penis had fallen into the terrarium. It was lying among the plants with snails crawling over it and a lizard licking under the foreskin. <br />
<br />
“What happened?” They ran out into the hallways to discover that the same thing had happened all over the school.<br />
<br />
***<br />
***<br />
<br />
Nicole was very into guys. As soon as her breasts started filling out, she had been able to attract them likes flies to ointment. <br />
<br />
She slipped from the busy hallway to hide in the janitor’s closet waiting for Jeremy to walk by. As he did, she pulled him in and shut the door. He gasped in alarm. She clasped her hand over his mouth and then, slowly, got down on her knees and proceeded to undo the zipper of his pants. His rising bulge pushed his underwear through the opening in his jeans. She looked up at him. He gave an embarrassed smile and grunt.  <br />
<br />
Shortly after, she stripped down to nothing as he felt her breasts and moaned. His penis protruded from his pants like an angry wasp’s stinger. He entered inside of her, gasping. She yipped. He thrust back and forth and back and forth... And then he was gone and his clothes fell to the floor! <br />
<br />
She reached down and felt his balls still protruding from her pussy. He was still inside of her! Well his dick was anyway and that was all that mattered. She shrugged and wiggled it about inside of her, gripping the balls and using it like one of her toys. <br />
<br />
Several minutes later she exited the closet, looking both ways. She had decided to keep Jeremy inside her for fun. <br />
<br />
Sneaking back into art class, she quickly learned it was not just him. All the guys in the school were reduced to just their dicks! While the girls were rushing around trying to figure out what was going on, she plucked a dick that had fallen in wet plaster and snuck it into her purse. When they again turned their heads she snatched a big one that was lying on a paint pallet covered in colors. And another one out of a clumsily-made clay pot that he must have been working on prior to the changes. <br />
<br />
She was going to enjoy this new world! <br />
<br />
***<br />
***<br />
<br />
Cindy was the mother of Nicole, Jessica, June, and Rebecca on Daniel. It was tough raising four girls on her own, but she worked a steady office job. <br />
<br />
She was talking with her boss in the office. She hated him. He was such a jerk. He told her to go down to Purchasing to chase down the missing invoice. He acted as if she was barely there. Men. First her jerk of an ex-husband and now this jerkwad. <br />
<br />
She went to the elevator and pressed the down button. The elevator doors opened. There was nobody in it, but the floor of the elevator was covered in pants, belts, and dress shirts. Strewn about on top of the clothing were six adult penises of various shapes and colours. What had happened here?<br />
<br />
She ran back to the office! The photo-copier was going on its own. She approached cautiously and lifted the lid. She found a long, erect, uncut penis pressed beneath, squirming to the vibrations of the machine as photo copies of itself kept spitting out of the tray. Semen was dribbling from the plate down the side of the photo-copier. <br />
<br />
She picked up speed, passing two penises in front of the water cooler and checked the cubicles. Each cubicle had a penis lying on the chair or sitting on the keyboard. Even the cute new intern’s cubicle had a hot dick in a cup of coffee. The men were gone! A secretary started shrieking on the other side of the building. <br />
<br />
***<br />
***<br />
<br />
Rebecca was out in the middle of the wilderness. She had taken the week off to go camping with her friends. They had been a solid group since college. She and Josh had even been dating recently. They had hiked up into the mountains and set up their camp in a grove of trees next to a lake. It was late in the day and Julie and the Guys were setting up for dinner. They had the fire going and were preparing the meat. Josh had gone down to the beach to get away from the crowd and stare at the beauty of the lake. Steve was taking a nap after their hike. Marylyn and Jon were playing Frisbee with the dog. Rebecca ducked into her tent and changed out of her sweaty hiking clothes. She heard the girls shout. The dog barked. <br />
<br />
She ran out of her tent.  The guys were gone from the campfire. Julie stood there agape. <br />
<br />
“They were right there! They just… disappeared!”<br />
<br />
Rebecca stared. There were two piles of clothing there. She noticed something near the fire and lunged for it! <br />
<br />
“It’s… a dick!” There was a penis near the fire… and it felt real! It was warm from the heat. Any closer and it might have started cooking. It was dark and hooded and near Davi’s clothes. Julie found Jose’s in a hotdog bun next to the packet. “Well that’s cute…” His brown skin and skinny length made it look almost exactly like a hotdog.  <br />
<br />
“This is weird,” muttered Rebecca. They found Steve’s nestled in his soft sleeping bag. “Must have been sleeping naked.” They noted the lack of clothing in the sleeping bag. They ran to the beach. Josh’s was rolling in the gentle surf, being washed up on the beach and then dragged back into the water as the waves receded. It was very hard from all this action. She plucked it from the surf and dusted off the sand. It came. <br />
<br />
“Gross,” said Julie. Rebecca was relieved they had found him. <br />
<br />
They found Marylyn looking through the bushes. “He was right here! And then he must have ran off!” The dog trotted up. <br />
<br />
“Oh, no” muttered Julie. From the dog’s mouth protruded a cockhead on one side and balls on the other. The dog carried them gently and set the gonads in front of Marylyn. <br />
<br />
“What!!” She shrieked. Something very odd was going on. They gathered up the dicks and put them in the guys’ water bottles so they could tell whose was whose. Then they started taking down the camp. <br />
<br />
***<br />
***<br />
Back at the school, Jessica had a grid layed out on the gym floor in masking tape. There were penises placed in each square with slips of paper with details about where they were found. She had taken the photo IDs they had found and were trying to match them to the penis. They held the slips and were working to match the right name to the right penis. They wrapped the penises they were certain of with the school’s photo ID lanyards. <br />
<br />
“At least the coach was easy.” Susan pointed to by-far the largest, thickest, hairiest penis on the grid. She put a slip of paper by him. <br />
“Okay, who was in the swimming session, does anybody remember?”<br />
<br />
“Well Dustin was a short guy, would he be this small one here?” piped up Aurora, pointing. <br />
<br />
Jessica bit her lip.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it’s that simple.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not.” cut in Mary, “My brother is a skinny, short guy, but I saw him changing behind the car door at the beach once. Dude was hung…  I wonder if that’s all he is now.” <br />
<br />
They stared at the photos of the young men next to their lanyard-tied penises. They had a moment of silence for the men they once knew.</p>
