<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I had to do this.&quot; He thought as he sped down the stairs. &quot;I needed to-oo!&quot; He began to justify before he tripped on the final step. The camera flung up into the air while he plummeted towards the ground, barely managing to catch himself as he did so. He had seen Olivia, Emily&#39;s mother, looking quite concerned just before he landed. An all too familiar flash wrong out as the camera hit the ground, changing both Olivia and Rick.<br />
<br />
Rick knew he had changed again, but he could barely tell what had changed since he was still in pain from the fall. He managed to lift his head up, only to see that Olivia was no longer standing there. The camera was sitting there upside down, with the photo of his change just coming out. He put his face back on the ground and decided to lay there for a moment, feeling hurt and defeated.<br />
<br />
Without having any time to think, he heard footsteps coming from the other room. He knew it had to be Emily, coming to check in and see what happened. He didn&#39;t know how to explain what had happened. He couldn&#39;t tell her that he was planning on ditching the device in the trash. She wouldn&#39;t understand just how freaky it was for him. He could still remember being nothing more than a brush. He could still remember who he was but he felt an urge to be used by his &quot;master&quot; as nothing more than a common object. He just had to get rid of it, but now he&#39;s gone and screwed himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Emily yelled rounding the corner. &quot;Who are.... wait, Rick!?&quot; She yelled.<br />
<br />
Rick only managed a nod out of shame, embarrassment, and pain. He was able to feel though the pain now, and could tell how he had transformed again, and he did not like it. But, he was concerned more with Emily&#39;s reaction and what had happened to Emily&#39;s mother. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well.&quot; She said smugly. &quot;Let me guess Rick, you were getting this to get back at me weren&#39;t you? HA! Looks like that backfired a bit didn&#39;t it? Karma&#39;s a bitch isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick sighed in relief. At least Emily didn&#39;t know what he had actually meant to accomplish. He could feel everything now, and realized how he had changed. He was lying on his chest, but was off the ground as two extremely large breasts sat like cushions for his body. He saw curly locks surrounding his eyes as it spread across the floor. They were red, but also had tinges of gray. <br />
<br />
&quot;You, *snicker*, want to see what you look like now?&quot; she chuckled.<br />
<br />
Rick lifted his head up again, pushing his long hair out of the way with his small, manicured hands. Emily practically shoved the picture in his face. Rick was greeted with a photo of a middle aged woman mid-fall. She looked a lot like Rick&#39;s mother, and was undoubtedly what he would look like as an older woman. She was wearing mom jeans that hugged her large, slightly sagging butt, and had a tight tank top with a bright bra sticking out of it. The woman had massive amounts of hair, too much makeup and way too much jewelry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great.&quot; Rick said aloud in his new motherly tone. &quot;Just perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Emily said. &quot;let me help you up, &quot;Mom&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; Rick questioned as he got to his feet. He was shocked to see that Emily had changed slightly as well. Her most noticeable change was her hair. It used to be a brunette with straight, long hair, but was now a ginger with curly short hair only reaching her shoulders. Her ass was slightly smaller, but her breasts were much larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think I ran in here doofus?&quot; She retorted. &quot;I found myself changing, and when I didn&#39;t see the camera anywhere, I went to go see what had gone wrong, and then I found you and this.&quot; She said, holding up the somehow intact, but slightly sparking camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God!&quot; Rick gasped nervously. &quot;Is it... broken?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not fully broken, just a little busted up.&quot; She replied after looking at it a bit more. &quot;They built these sorts of cameras to last, which is kind of ironic since they became so obsolete so quickly. It should be fine as long as we don&#39;t keep chucking it around like that, wouldn&#39;t you agree Mommy?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t call me that.&quot; He groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; She asked with a chuckle. &quot;Reality changed you into my mother right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Rick yelled, slapping his forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Emily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Mom was standing in here when I fell and I think she must have been in the shot judging by where she was standing and what I could make out before I fell down.&quot; He said panicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?&quot; She asked concerned. &quot;Then... then where is she Rick?&quot; She asked as she began looking around. <br />
<br />
Rick picked up the picture while Emily glanced around, somewhat worried that the camera was more damaged than she had thought. Rick examined the photo. He didn&#39;t see any animals or new plants or anything like that in the photo. Rick started to wonder if maybe she just was somewhere else now since Rick was in her role. That&#39;s when Rick spotted the purple bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily, I think I may have found her.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; She asked confused. &quot;Where?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick lifted up his shirt, to reveal a bright purple, satin bra. The color, as Rick and noticed, was the same color as the dress Olivia had been wearing. Emily looked closer and eventually found the brand name, which simply read &quot;Olivia&quot; in some fancy font. Rick pulled his shirt back down, awkwardly around his breasts, and braced himself for Emily screaming. He was surprised to only hear a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phew, I was worried the camera was really broken there.&quot; She laughed, before gently placing the camera down on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- but, your mother is a bra!&quot; Rick yelled. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be a bit more concerned about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey it&#39;s not like I wanted her to be a bra. That was your mess up remember?&quot; She retorted. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not like we can&#39;t change her back.&quot; She laughed. &quot;Chill okay, take her off and we&#39;ll do it now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a second.&quot; He said. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re getting just how it feels to be an inanimate object. To have your free will start to become suppressed as you&#39;re nothing more than an object. To not know when you&#39;ll turn back, and be unable to ask. To... to...&quot; He tried to continue, but a combination of his new hormones and the stress of the situation finally got to him. Rick began to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god.&quot; Emily said, before hugging Rick. &quot;Rick I&#39;m so sorry. I had no idea that you felt this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I&#39;m sorry I should have told you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey it&#39;s okay.&quot; She replied giving another warm hug. Emily looked Rick in the eyes, and although she felt slightly weirded out what was essentially her mother a kiss on the lips, she knew it&#39;s what Rick needed. Unfortunately, they were quickly interrupted by Emily&#39;s dad, and Rick&#39;s new husband, Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys!&quot; He said walking through the front door. &quot;How are my two favorite ladies do- Woah, is everything alright?&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick and Emily, both upraised to see him there so early, awkwardly froze before Emily quickly moved her direction and kissed Rick on the cheek.<br />
&quot;Oh uh, you know dad, just uh, girl stuff?&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh alright.&quot; He said putting his large work bag down on the table. &quot;You okay Riley?&quot; He asked Rick, grabbing both of his hands. <br />
<br />
Rick felt a little weirded out. This was the strong guy that had read him the riot act when he had started dating Emily, and now here he was looking so concerned and talking to him so gently. It also weirded Rick out that him doing this was actually helping him calm down. He looked up and forced a smile.<br />
&quot;Yeah... honey.&quot; He said, trying to best mimic Emily&#39;s mother&#39;s speaking tone. &quot;We just had some, um, mother daughter bonding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, if you say so.&quot; He shrugged, before giving Rick a quick peck on the lips. Rick&#39;s expression sank without Paul noticing as Paul walked into the side room. Rick, still with his jaw dropped, turned towards Emily who was trying her best not to burst out laughing. Paul rushed back in, holding some rolled up schematics. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to say kiss and run, but I was just here to grab some schematics.&quot; He explained as he shoved some of his things on the table back into his large work bag. &quot;I gotta get back to the construction site. Bye baby! Bye honey! See you later!&quot; He yelled as he rushed out the door.<br />
<br />
Once the door slammed, and Paul had walked a good ways away, Emily started to laugh hysterically. Rick glared at her as she wiped a tear from her eye. &quot;Oh come on!&quot; Emily laughed. &quot;That had to be at least a little funny to you!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rick wanted to deny it, but as much as he was grossed out by it he couldn&#39;t help but smile at the shear weirdness of it all. <br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;I guess it was a little funny.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Right?!&quot; She agreed. &quot;What do you think he&#39;d fine more horrifying; The fact that he just kissed his daughter&#39;s former boyfriend or that his former wife was being worn by that boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, no idea... oh hey, let&#39;s change you Mom and I back now alright? I&#39;m not tooo big a fan of having, these.&quot; He said as he jiggled one boon. &quot;I&#39;m also sure your mother isn&#39;t a fan of holding them either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she&#39;s not aware so she just thinks she&#39;s a bra right now... but I get your point.&quot; She reluctantly agreed. &quot;So, let&#39;s turn you two back.&quot;<br />
<br />
They both turned to where the camera had been placed, only to see it was no longer sitting on the table. Both their hearts sank for a moment right before they turned towards each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god he must have thrown it in his bag by mistake!&quot; Emily screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quick!&quot; Rick agreed. &quot;We gotta stop him.<br />
<br />
As they ran out the door, they found....</p>
