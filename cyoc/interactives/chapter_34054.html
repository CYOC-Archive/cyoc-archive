<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Swearing, you chase after the skunk. He turned you into a freak and seemed content to just leave you that way and go about his merry way while he's all but destroyed your life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back here you son of a...&quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, your tail and new feet are doing things to your balance that in hindsight you should have expected. You end up falling and land with a thud on your stomach. As you pick yourself with a grunt and a frown on your face, you hear the pitter patter of little before you. Standing before you, having seemingly come out of nowhere (though you realize he was probably hiding in a bush) is the skunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me back,&quot; you yell. &quot;How dare you make me a freak like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk looks at you, his expression a grin. You feel a mix of fear and anger at your predicament. This skunk has a sense of control over you. You fear that he might hold you hostage and demand you do something unethical in order to regain your manhood and humanity on the lower half of your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say something you son of a...&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk reacts in a way you least expect. It leaps at you, landing on your head. You grab at it to try to throw it off as your fear turns into a downright panic. Your heart rate accelerates to a level that makes you feel light headed and you fear you're going to have a heart attack. The skunk seems to be stuck on as pulling on him only serves to send waves of pain through your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get off,&quot; you scream.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, tendrils of latex stream from the skunks body, grabbing at your hands, forcing you to let go of the skunk. If that wasn't bad enough, you feel a warmth and react with disgust as it you think the skunk has peed on you. WHat he's done however is much worse. His body has begun to melt, the latex producing more latex which streams over your head, covering your eyes and plunging you into darkness. Somehow, you're still able to breathe.<br />
<br />
The latex moves down to your neck and down to your shoulders. Your screams vanish as the latex covers your mouth.<br />
<br />
The rest of your body feels warm and a sense of doom threatens to send you into a panic the likes of which you've never experienced. You know what is going to happen. Denial hits your first, perhaps the skunk won't do anything at all. You hope against hope even as you feel the latex changing your body under it. He's violating you and there isn't a thing you can do about it!<br />
<br />
You regain your sight and look down at your body to see your torso taking a female form.<br />
<br />
After what feels like an eternity but is in reality mere minutes, the latex streams from your body from your belly where it pools onto the ground in front of you and reforms into the skunk.<br />
<br />
Taking several deep breaths, you can only whimper and you look at the skunk. A gaze down at your body reveals a white fur on your chest and belly and a pair of breasts. They're not huge but you know you'll never be able to hide them. When you feel around your head, you find you have a short muzzle and that your ears and smaller, rounded and closer to the top of your head. Your hair is much longer, reaching the midpoint of your back and it's white. You definitely have a tooney look to you from what you can tell. However, there is also no doubt as to your gender.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you do this to me,&quot; you cry.<br />
<br />
You're feeling a lot more vulnerable at the moment. You know nothing of how to be a female, let alone a female skunk! This skunk has violated your entire sense of self along with your body. Any desire to run home and hide is tempered with the knowledge that losing track of the skunk will doom you to spend the rest of your life in this form.<br />
<br />
The skunk can only grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHy so glum my dear? This can't happen so it must not be happening. Am I correct,&quot; the skunk says.<br />
<br />
You gasp and stamp your feet. Forming your right hand into a fist and growl and frown at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How dare you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Read your mind,&quot; he says. &quot;Clever girl, you figured it out right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl? How dare you talk to me like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk grins. &quot;You are indeed a female, a fully functional one at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no right,&quot; you yell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps not. However before you reject this find body I've bestowed upon you, perhaps you wish to learn more about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before your eyes, the skunk begins to liquify. The liquid grows and takes on the shape of a humanoid skunk, albeit a male one that is just a bit taller then you. When the liquid turns to flesh and blood, a naked humanoid male skunk stands before you.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you trying to pull?&quot; you ask. &quot;What, you think that just because you do this to my body that I'm just going to act like I was always this way?&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk grins. &quot;Of course not. There are however other ways to motivate a person.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're unsure of his motivation. Perhaps he wanted a companion. He could have also just been playing a prank to see how you'd react.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I don't know who or what you are,&quot; you say. &quot;I don't know how you're able to do this to me. But this isn't the movies. I can't just leap into your arms and then we walk off into the night living happily ever after. You read my mind so you know that I have a life, friends and a family. There is no way I can just run off with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk shakes his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't expecting you to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can't just have sex with you either,&quot; you say. &quot;I mean, come on, you know that it doesn't work that way. Becoming a female isn't like trying on a new pair of jeans. Just because I'm a girl doesn't mean I'm about to become a sex freak that does it with anyone, any time and anywhere. Maybe other people act that way but I doubt a female version of me would be the opposite of the male version of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk cocks his head. &quot;Sex doesn't interest you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't say that. I mean that even if the idea of it interests me, I can't just jump into bed with a stranger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk smirks. &quot;But you are interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to say that I've made you a lovely female,&quot; the skunk says. &quot;I assure you the experience you be pleasurable. Perhaps my people have different views then yours do on the subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps? Hello, now that you've ever so graciously made me a girl, now I have to worry about getting pregnant!&quot; you say. &quot;I mean, I don't want to be a mother! Even the idea of being mom goes against everything I've grown up with. Maybe some day I could be a dad but I'm not ready for that! I'm certainly not about to just be a housewife!&quot;<br />
<br />
The skunk smiles. &quot;You won't become pregnant, I assure you. Being a female should not force such limits upon you in this day and age. Perhaps however, it will make you more empathic to human females should I change you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it will but come on man, I need to get home in my human *male* body!&quot; you say. &quot;I mean, if you did this to me just for sex, I'm a bit worried about you. I was a guy after all!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree that as a man, we would be incomparable,&quot; the skunk says. &quot;However, I sensed you seem to be a type of person that -- we could be wonderful friends. Making you female would permit out relationship to go to a new level if we desire it. I admit that it has been some time for me. Perhaps I should have asked but I doubt you'd have agreed to this. I will change you back if you so desire but at least consider this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sigh and think about it. All logic would dictate that you should demand he change you back and once he does, to run away and never look back. Giving in could well be a betrayal of your manhood and humanity. However, you do remember lessons about inner beauty and how the body is just a shell with the spirit being what counts. That shell however can and does affect what you're able to do to an extent. Would giving in be a betrayal of more then just your former body? You wonder how much of being a male human is just a physical shape as opposed to a state of being.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here's what I want to do,&quot; you say.</p>
