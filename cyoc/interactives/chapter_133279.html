<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he was about to sit down, Jerry&#39;s phone vibrated. Looking at it, he saw the alert from his Instagram and clicked on it. As it opened up to a video by a model named Jae Bang, he groaned a little. Normally he wouldn&#39;t have followed someone like her, but for the sake of his own business, as she&#39;d been a spokeswoman for one of the many lines of sportswear he carried.  But his attention was suddenly caught by the last bit in the video...<br />
<br />
&quot;Howevah&#39; if any of you queer bitches are listening, you should know that all of this beauty is for the men! You ain&#39;t evah gonna get to touch this! Bang OUT!&quot;<br />
<br />
He blinked at such a blatant homophobia, and his finger hovered over the unfollow button. But something stopped him and he merel closed the app. Shaking off that random bit of hate that had intruded in his life, Jerry decided to get back to the show on his TV. After all, he loved Jordan Randalls&#39; program, especially when the camera lingered on his ass. He grinned as the angry chef did have a spectcularly tight rear, a small flush of lust welling up and sealing his fate.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Jerry&#39;s sporting goods business had taken out a few ads in newspapers across town, but now all them began to change. The plain lettering and phone number gave way to a stylized sunset with palm trees across which was emblazoned a neon logo that read &#39;Paradise Photography&#39;.  Furthermore, a nearby billboard shuddered as a huge version of the same advertstment washed away a message from the local gay right group....<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jerry was beginning to feel the first signs of the curse&#39;s power washing over him, as his interest in the cooking show on his tv waned greatly.  Bored with it now, he began to switch through the channels, looking for something.  When he came across a reality show about college girls sharing a beach house, he surprised himself by stopping on it. But something, the way that their breasts bounced as they ran down the beach really interested him now.<br />
<br />
As he struggled with these new feelings of attraction, Jerry&#39;s body was beginning to change. His dress slacks began to lighten up, the dark fabric giving way to khaki as the legs rolled upwards to reveal the businessman&#39;s tanned and toned calves.  Polished black leather shoes gave way to something more casual and brown.  There was tearing noises as his pants completed their transformation into a cargo shorts underneath which his dick began to rise to attention. It gained length and width, forcing Jerry to uncross his legs and take a wider stance on the couch. His briefs strained against it, but gave way as they became boxers.<br />
<br />
Jerry&#39;s left hand dropped down to his groin, and began kneeding it as he watched the babes on the screen. As if in response, the sleeves of his dress shirt began to recede up to uncover his forearms.  The tanned skin was suddenly darkening in different spots as various tattoos began to develop on the surface. Intertwining serpents extended down to his hands, which suddenly grew more calloused and rougher. Rings of gold and silver popped into existence on his fingers, while a high*end watch with leather straps wrapped around his right wrist.<br />
<br />
The change to his shirt continued as the material shifted to a lighter type of cotton while also darkening to a charcoal grey, His starched collar tore away, twisting itself into a thick braid of silver that hung around a thickening neck up which was creeping tattoos similar to the ones that graced his arms. Buttons popped off as the front sealed itself up and completed its transition into a comfortable t-shirt.  On its chest, a logo identical to the ones that replaced Jerry&#39;s ads pressed its way outward, pressed further forward by a swell in the man&#39;s pectoral muscles. <br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, in a certain Instagram model&#39;s smartphone, a new contact titled &#39;Gerald&#39; was typing itself into existence. Soon dozens and dozens of messages between her and him were appearing, stretching back for years.  Then, the contact information jumped from Jae&#39;s phone over to her bestie Jessica&#39;s phone, which brought more messages. And so it spread...<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
As his body changed, so too did the apartment Jerry lived in. The furnishings which had been modest became more expensive. His kitchen grew larger with a huge marble countertop bursting up from the floor.  His couch became all leather with built-in recliners, into which he now unconsciously leaned back as he continued to touch himself in response to the images on his TV.  The few paintings he&#39;d had on the walls were replaced with framed images of beautiful women. All of them seemed to be posing for the pictures, each one of them a masterpiece.  <br />
<br />
The closet store that had once been James&#39; apartment expanded greatly.  One section remained closed off but now a red bulb stood over the door behind which a full photographic dark room was coming into existence. In another corner, the plain queen bed Jerry had been sleeping on grew wider and wider, becoming  a full sized king with a thick oaken headboard and black sheets. Across from that, the various sport equipment that had been filled this space twisted and contorted themselves into lamps and lights that framed an area. In front of this, a professional tripod planted itself with a top-of-the-line camera on it.  Overall, the store had become a photographer&#39;s studio.<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
In response to these developments, Jerry&#39;s mind was bombarded by flashes of light, each one a snapshot of a different woman standing in front of him. Each time it flashed, he could feel his gayness bleeding away, as confidence swelled up inside him.  After all, these women sought him out, didn&#39;t they? His knowledge of sales was being replaced by years of experience behind the lens of a camera. His brown eyes suddenly became green, and much more focused. His undercut began to grow in, the hair stretching down past his shoulders before an unseen force gathered into a ponytail. <br />
<br />
His left hand continued to massage his cock through his shorts as his new self came into clear focus. He was Gerald, the owner and operator of Paradise Photography, the number one private studio in the city with a long list of celebrity clients.  As he climaxed,  his sexuality completed its shift from homo to hetero.Just then, the smartphone in his pocket vibrated and the veteran photographer reached in to check it.  He grinned widely,  his perfect teeth almost shining as he saw it was a message from his favorite subject, the lovely Jae Bang<br />
<br />
JBang69: -Hey! Did you see my vid?-<br />
<br />
ParadisePhotog: -Sure did,babe. Congrats on 35 mil-<br />
<br />
JBang69: -Wanna help me celebrate? XXX-<br />
<br />
Gerald let out a low whistle as he recalled all the fun he&#39;d had with her before. His fingers quickly typed out a reply.<br />
<br />
ParadisePhotog: -Ur place or mine?-<br />
<br />
======<br />
<br />
Another victim had fallen prey to the curse, growing its power even more as it now had a extensive web connections between those it had infected.  Each of those ties reinforced its hold, and allowed it to cast a wider net for others to latch onto.  The thread tying Gerald and Jae was going to reap huge benefits...</p>
