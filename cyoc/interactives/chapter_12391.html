<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren smiled, we were of agreement Pony Fire was to be my coma. Oh but the fond memories of younger days and the wild creature which stired my blood. Now it seemed as if to honor that wonderful creature I would have his likeness injected upon my chest.<br />
<br />
Stripping off my shirt I readied myself with a deep breath of personal delight as to calm down and lay down on Darren's couch.<br />
<br />
He also readied himself as then rolling to the side of that couch a tray filled with equipment of his trade.<br />
<br />
&quot;First I must shave your chest, alright?&quot; asked Darren as he had the most thought filled expression on his face.<br />
<br />
A spray can of some oily liquid served as the beginning. I watched him with graceful hand stroke the skin of my hairy chest with that straight razorblade.<br />
<br />
Then a hot towel to soften and clean away the remaining oil. As with a deep breath he did begin. The electric needle hummed and buzzed as first an outline appeared. I watched in wonder and awe as this artist went about his work.<br />
<br />
Slowly on the ears, then crown of his head, eyes, and building those sound cheek bones Fire took shape. <br />
<br />
Not a word or even a song did Darren made as he was as intent his creation of this art. Time after time he'd stop and still without a word adjust his needle, or get up and stepping back eyed my chest as if a canvas.<br />
<br />
A good three hours later he sat up straight, he smiled at me and pronounced the work was complete.<br />
<br />
I slowly got up as if the wrinkles in my chest would damage his piece of wonderous art. Once standing the full length mirror reflected the most real picture of my favorite pet, Fire!<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren your a master of the art, its so real one might think he was there and could move or snort!&quot; I exclaimed in wild delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like it Kyle, then I know you will enjoy just what Fire can do for your love life.&quot; said Darren.<br />
<br />
&quot;No this is for me to see and remember, I'm widowed now and living alone!&quot; so I told him.<br />
<br />
Darren smiled again but this time as if he had some deep truth to tell about what was just permanently added to my body.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see!&quot; came Darren's reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'll see what, tell me is there a problem?&quot; I asked now being worried and showing this in my quivering voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You now something special as is that reflection of Fire is and will be for you a renewing of a deep dark passion!&quot; again said Darren as if taunting me on.<br />
<br />
I was suddenly worried as if I'd out of foolish admiration of his artistic ability then been injured maybe or poisened by some mad hatter guy?<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight, when you get home I'd suggest you sit for a while outside and take advantage of the clear sky. As the moon rises early in it's first quarter phase the cool of the evening will arouse Fire there. It is then I know you will find memories and fond joyous thoughts come to be alive once again. The tatoo is more real then you can yet imagine!&quot; Darren told me.<br />
<br />
I pulled on my shirt without a word as the fear he instilled right then was enough to make me wish I'd never stepped through that door. A toss down of two hundred dollars was brushed aside as he just smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No charge Kyle, its a gift from the management, enjoy!&quot; he said as I picked up my money as scurried off.<br />
<br />
My day in the sun and sea was for me right then ruined. I had something of a wonderous reminder of younger days and happy carefree times. Yet those were all great, then too what had I just allowed done to my body? This made me want to head home and try to calm down.<br />
<br />
The phone was ringing like crazy when I walked in the back door. My Father was on the line wanting to know if I'd come for a cookout that night? I agreed without thinking much of Darren's words and went about collecting some things to take along.<br />
<br />
Dad's lake front cottage was if the family now two generations. A great ole English tudor house it was like stepping back in time to a richer age. Dad and Mom both now in their late eighties were still healthy and spry enough to get around even by car.<br />
<br />
As I got out my car the smell of his charcoal cooker warming up filled the air. We all greeted warmly as Dad slipped me a lite beer and the two of us plopped down into some Adirondak chairs.<br />
<br />
The dinner was great, the company was and has always been the warmth which kept my heart going after the loss of Jane. And so went the early evening till from out the far surface of the lake appeared a bright slit of Moon.<br />
<br />
Even as we talked and laughed together there was a strange feeling welling up in my chest.<br />
<br />
Soon it was almost an agony feeling as my temperment was noted by Mother wondering if I had some indigestion problem?<br />
<br />
At first I said no, but as the feelings seemed to make me uncomfortable they also were making me very horny.<br />
<br />
Excusing myself and with two parents showing their concern on each face I got into my car for the hour long drive to home.<br />
<br />
Not ten minutes down the road and my heart was beating like I'd run a mile. I was sweating and felt very itchy. The clear night sky and that quarter moon gave an eerie white glow to everything aside the road.<br />
<br />
My breathing got heavier, not rapid but just deep drafts of breath. I was coming up to the Mason Apple Orchard when it hit full force. Turning the steering wheel had to the right my car flew off the road and into a lucky spot of just open grasses.<br />
<br />
I flicked the door latch open and just rolled out into the grassy field. My head ached, shoulders felt like a mountain was forced down upon them. Fingers and toes went numb as the chest seemed to be getting larger.<br />
<br />
It had to be the tatoo, but how? I wondered this till the buttons on my shirt started to pop off one by one.<br />
<br />
A oggled look down to my chest proved I had a real stiff neck. Almost able to see the face of Fire but it seemed to be fading under a new covering of chest hairs.<br />
<br />
I bet had I not been in such a feeling of distress that the realization of those fast growing chest hairs would maybe have signaled what was happening, but it didn't!<br />
<br />
Suddenly my pants felt tight around the waist and with dull feeling almost numb fingers I fumbled the belt and snap loose.<br />
<br />
A jab of pain hit my backbone and flipped me onto my back. One spasm of pain ran down the spine from my skull to the butt. I moaned and screamed but there was not a soul out that night to hear my groanings.<br />
<br />
It hurt so damn bad my butt was jerking making me almost laugh as if I was humping some female.<br />
<br />
Then it slowed, like a wave upon the beach it just seeped away till I lay there peering up at the Moon with one eye.<br />
<br />
My breathing calmed as heart raced onward. The dull feelings in hands and feet now were stranger yet as they would not move to my desired thoughts.<br />
<br />
At rest, calm, and strange deep satisfaction over being alive crept over me and I lay there at long last without any pains. I must have laid there quite some time feeling the delight in being pain free and not wishing to move less it all began again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must get up, I must try to stand up!&quot; came the urging thought.<br />
<br />
Rolling up to lay on one side I pushed myself up with arms as legs strained to find an easy way to get us up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I'm up and no more pains!&quot; I tried to yell out. I did try to yell it out but what issued forth from my lips was the shrill sounding voice of Fire that wonderously beautiful stallion I remembered all so very well.<br />
<br />
A deep breath and then like I was clearing my mind by clearing my nose a snort of true equine sound rattled out my nostrils.<br />
<br />
It kind'a scared me and I stood very still. Then as if a call to explore the orchard a step and then another bringing me to be quite a ways from the car.<br />
<br />
My thoughts were foggy, I thought that was from the battle of pain I'd felt. As I walked the orchard rows a scent travelled up my nose, &quot;Horses!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister Mason had two very fine pair of Friesian horses he used during those days when the County Fair was in town. I pranced that way following the wafting scent from those wonderful creatures.<br />
<br />
A cool breeze kicked up and with my nakedness it chilled me bringing on an erection. I stopped by the gate to the corral as my erection became extreme and rock hard. I stood there with eyes closed enjoying the feelings as they flowed through my being.<br />
<br />
A snuffling sound, eyes popped open and I turned toward it as my heart skipped a beat. There off in the far end of the corral was what all my senses told me to be a mare and in estrus.<br />
<br />
Prancing up and down the fenceline my mind ablaze with wild desires I had to find a way into that corral. At last the fury of Fire came out in me and with a short run I did jump and clear with ease that four rail fence.<br />
<br />
Now was the time for a courtship to begin, as equine rituals surfaced into my mind the thoughts of having sex with an animal vanished. I was then somebody else and not myself!<br />
<br />
Pracing about tail held high I showed off for my sweet lover. Snorting and tossing my head about made her snuffle and whinnie softly at me. She seemed willing to my advances and this too thrilled me all the more.<br />
<br />
As I was some distance away from her and prancing up a storm of dust she turned her glorious rump in my direction.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I stopped, did stare, my breathing was now rapid and heart beat into a rythum of pure desire. Her tail began to rise up and with it on one side of that wonderous dark slit she made it wink at me.<br />
<br />
I screamed a loud whinnie and made a dashing beeline toward her invitation. A screeching halt behid her had me erect and ready. I think it was when my head leaned forward and a tongue reached forth slurping the brown juices ozzing out her willing vulva the reality factor kicked in.<br />
<br />
My upper lip curled into a knot as nostrils flared and erection turned to concrete. Breathing now rapid, heart pumping like mad I was thinking total lusty thoughts of a long gone stallion named Fire.</p>
