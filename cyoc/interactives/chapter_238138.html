<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Animalia has had many a recently-converted newcomer act out on their enhanced hormones, not many get as outspoken as Layla. The newest employee at the Meat Market was very noticeable. Not just because Layla had large than average breasts for a cheetah, but she was gaining a reputation for being very loose and inviting any interested stud to rail her. At least she was making sure to keep taking her birth control pills. This would be noticeable enough if Layla didn&#39;t keep boasting on social media, though leaving out the most explicit details. Though she was far less reserved on the premium page of Animalia&#39;s website and OnlyFans. Those who knew Layla before would hardly recognize her as this sexually-charged cheetah.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Before her conversion, Layla looked like your typical Midwestern mom type, the type who wore sweaters that made her look plumper than she already is. Of course, one key difference to Layla was she was certainly not a mom and wasn&#39;t the marrying type. Layla was actually very much against the 50&#39;s housewife archetype. She wanted to be able to make her own business without having to rely on a husband. Layla&#39;s approach to that was home-based marketing, mostly in the form of baked goods and cookbooks about baked goods. It met with minimal success, just enough to keep her afloat. The problem was that outside of her hometown, she had very little name recognition amidst so many other home businesses.<br />
<br />
Looking for a way to get more recognizable, Layla was able to save up enough to get a double-dosed conversion. She went with a cheetah because she wanted to be skinny for once. And once she was converted, she should stand out more against her competition and be able to make her business really thrive. Little did Layla suspect that she would starting on a whole new line of work. Her recorded conversion definitely demonstrated that and was something that could only be seen on the premium page of the Animalia website.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The webcam had a good view of the 40+ plump woman in a sweater. &quot;Hey everyone, Layla here. To those who know me, I&#39;ve got big news. I&#39;m about to go through a major rebranding and it&#39;s not just my merchandise. I&#39;m about to convert into a cheetah Animalian. Some might say it&#39;s drastic, but sometimes you have to make big changes to stay in business. But I&#39;ll still be me on the inside.&quot; She held up a tall glass of milk and said, &quot;Well, here&#39;s to a new Layla.&quot; With that, she drank down the whole glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, I can feel it spreading through my tummy,&quot; said Layla. There were subtle changes in her face. Fat was draining away along with the faint signs of age. There were getting less subtle as her nose started changing, pushing out a bit more as her tip grew darker. Her chin was also pushing out as her face starting forming a muzzle. Fur was starting to spread across the edges of her face, including the signature tearmarks of a cheetah. &quot;I&#39;m feeling fuzzier,&quot; said Layla as her ears started getting bigger and rounder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Starting to get kinda warm,&quot; said Layla, &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind if I take this off.&quot; She pulled off her sweater and sighed with relief. The body under it was a lot different from before. The white shirt was getting baggier as the pounds were melting away. Spotted fur was spreading across her arms and down her neck. However, the one place not growing smaller was her breasts. In fact, it looked a lot like the mass from most of her body was being funneled there. Her baggy shirt started getting tight against her breasts as more and more of her cleavage was being shown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoo, I&#39;m getting hotter, much hotter,&quot; said Layla, pulling up her shirt. Her waist had slimmed down a lot and her belly had disappeared before the surface rippled into lightly-defined abs. But the most noticeable changes were to her breasts. They were still swelling and starting to look ill-fitting in her bra, which was designed to hold smaller and less firm breasts. Layla panted as she squeezed her breasts. &quot;Oh, they feel so...so...confined...&quot; she moaned before she started undoing her bra, seemingly forgetting she was recording this. Her breasts soon bounced free, looking to be at least E cups.<br />
<br />
Layla moaned loudly as she squeezed them, playing with the nipples. Her transformation to a cheetah looked to be nearly complete, as her tail could be seen swishing behind her. But Layla seemed more interested in playing with her breasts, her nipples now starting to dribble with milk. &quot;Kitty wants more milk,&quot; she moaned before lifting one tit up. The boob&#39;s size and her slightly longer muzzle made it easy for her to suck from her own breast. Her other hand played with the other tit, but soon it started circling downwards. Her hand was no longer onscreen, but from her arm&#39;s movements and the moan she was making, it was obvious what she was doing with it. And the increasing pitch of her moans showed how close she was until made one last squeal, her nipples letting out one last spurt of milk.<br />
<br />
Layla sighed as she licked her lips. The Midwestern mom-type had been completely replaced by a total sexpot of a cheetah with huge milky breasts. She fondled her breasts a bit more before seeming to finally remember that her computer&#39;s camera was still filming. Rather than being embarrassed or ashamed, she leaned closer to the camera and said, &quot;Well, I think I came out nicely. But maybe you&#39;re less interested in baked good than these sweater puppies.&quot; She gave her tits another squeeze and said, &quot;But don&#39;t you worry about supply and demand. You&#39;ll be seeing a lot more of these girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Since then, Layla had abandoned the home-marketing and focused more on self-marketing, her body that is. She was certainly more popular and more profitable than her previous business. Though there was some concern that Layla was getting too involved in her RHS. Though some were starting to think if this really was her personality that had been buried under a thick layer of self-dependence.</p>
