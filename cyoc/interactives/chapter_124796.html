<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     Issac and Ilvir had then found themselves in the basement of the village Elder who had offered them a temporary refuge while they prepare for the journey ahead. While he clearly showed some hesitation at first, he eventually caved in and left the duo to their own devices as he went with Marry to buy her supplies and gear for the journey ahead, which would approximately take about a weeks travel, which had made Issac a tad bit nervous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Even though his quest to purge the corruption had no real time constraint, Issac couldn&#39;t help but feel guilty that he was solving the problems of one world and ignoring the problems of his own, not to mention he didn&#39;t have even the slightest clue where to go from here, the cloud portal they had come from had long since disappeared, most likely materializing somewhere else on the plane.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Issac sighed at the thought of running around this dammed cloud land, searching for the portal for the rest of his days. However for now he needed to focus on two things, constantly moving no matter what  and preparing the holy circle he was drawing in the cloudly floor of the basement using a piece of chalk like cloud.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Ilvir watched him silently from the corner, his feet sinking slightly into the floor due to his weight but not enough for him to have o worry about it. Ilvir had been quiet for some time now, watching him, barely moving to the point where he looked like a regular statue surrounded by a world of white. The only thing that showed he was still alive was his exposed erection at seeing his Master bend over, giving him a perfect view of his thick cocks and massive balls which made Ilvir leak his purple pre cum just by looking at them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
       Absent mindedly stroking  one of his cocks at the view of his Master&#39;s rump, Ilvir finally broke the semi-awkward silence with a question.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Master, why did you agree to let Marry be your guide?&quot; He said, no discernible emotion in his voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;We need a guide to navigate through these lands my Spawn, not to mention the fact that an extra hand is always welcomed.&quot; Issac answered, giving out groan in frustration slightly as he attempted to draw his magic circle on the lumpy white floor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;It wasn&#39;t for... any other reason?&quot; Ilvir asked, the message in his voice clear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Issac sighed louder this time, understanding what Ilvir was gettting at. &quot;Ilvir, she may have looks but we only just met her, don&#39;t think I&#39;m suddenly cheating on you the second I meet another woman.&quot; Issac said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   &quot;No, you misunderstand, I am fine with having to share you and your... magnificence,&quot; he said with a shudder as one of his cocks spurted out a quick stream of purple cum.&quot;But, my question is when were you going to make Marry, your own?&quot; Ilvir asked casually.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Issac stopped drawing immediately, freezing in place for several seconds, almost sinking into the floor before he panickedly started moving again to prevent falling through the floor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
    Issac, jogging in place, looked at Ilvir, a noting the barely hidden lust within his spawn eyes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Ilvir, please do not tell me, you are thinking what I know your thinking.&quot; Issac said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;What&#39;s wrong Master? I thought you had already been planning to make her one of your Spawn the second you spared her life, why her voluptuous curves and smooth figure would make a perfect fuck toy for one such as yourself.&quot; Ilvir said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 &quot;Ilvir, she is innocent, I only made you my spawn so you would have a body, turning her would be practically a crime and a massive breach in my moral code, turning her into one of my Spawn simply to be a tool for pleasure is one of the most vile things imaginable.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   &quot;I see, however I would highly recommend that only your Spawn should travel with you, any strangers are a liability and you know that Issac.&quot; Ilvir stated. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Issac bit his lip. He never would have expected Ilvir would have been so straightforward about this. But Issac wouldn&#39;t really do something like that... would he? No, Issac thought shaking his head. Ilvir was clearly just in one of his horny periods right now, it&#39;ll wear off eventually, then they would put down the foul Sky King, return to their world and finally end the corruption. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
    &quot;Ilvir I ask you to never speak of this again, the circle is almost complete, and I&#39;ll need my full concentration to carry out the ritual.&quot; Issac said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Very well my Master, but if I may ask, what will this ritual do? The sigils you&#39;ve drawn so far are used in detection spells, what are you trying to detect?&quot; Ilvir asked, curiously, still masturbating at the sight of Issac.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;You&#39;ll see soon enough.&quot; Isaac said, finally completing the large ritual circle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
     Issac moved to the very center of the circle, closing his eyes and making sure to always be in movement lest he sink into the ground and ruin his circle.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
    Issac concentrating drawing out the latent divine magic that still resided deep within his soul, despite his latent corruption.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
        As he drew up his divine energy, allowing it course through his body, feeling it violently interact with his body, wracking every fiber of his being with an intense pain, but he persisted, fully allowing the magic to clash and course through his defiled body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
    The ritual circle began to glow beneath him, casting the entire basement into a yellow light as the ritual proceeded. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Deorum est lux, ignorare corpus peccatum meum: et noli me videtis hunc de terra nubes veritas.&quot; Issac chanted quietly, his body deteriorating slightly, pieces of his ivy withering into dust and parts of his granite body crumbling away, as the ritual continued.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
     The ritual itself was weaker than Issac expected, even with his corrupted body, most likely due to this plane being closer to the Otherworld than the divine world.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
     Issac continued chanting, his voice rising loudly for several minutes, then at the five minute mark, his chanting which had turned into full on shouting ceased and quieted, the pain of the divine magic slowly fading away as the ritual circle darkness and eventually stopped its glowing, returning back to its original white color.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
        The Elder watched alongside Ilvir, having come after hearing Issac&#39;s nonstop chanting, watching with a curious interest at the divine magic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   Issac kept his eyes shut, maintaining his concentration as a flow of information poured into his mind. Interesting he thought. This plane despite having the properties of the corruption was not actually corrupted in the slightest. In fact it never had been touched by the corrupted in the first place, the corruption itself was a product of the Otherworld leaking into the material world, but this place was like this since its creation, after all the corruption only infected things that weren&#39;t already like it, this place was naturally corrupted so therefore, how could something be corrupted if it was always like that to start with!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Which meant, theoretically, his enchanted dagger could work with the natives of this plane as well, which bodes good news for Issac indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   &quot;Interesting magic, you truly are from another world.... Issac.&quot; The Elder spoke quietly, almost muttering to himself. &quot;But at what cost has that magic done to your own body?&quot; He said, gesturing with his staff at Issac&#39;s devastated body, chunks of fur, plant, ice, stone, and scale had withered from his body, making Issac into a sickly version of his former self. Even his balls and cocks, which Issac took much pride in had shriveled away, leaving only thin wormy dicks in their place.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Isaac breathed heavily, his breath ragged and torn as he struggled to stand on two feet, thankfully though, his immense lost of weight had allowed him to not fully sink into the cloud below him. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Ilvir as soon as the ritual was completed, instinctively rushed to his master, holding him up with his granite strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Do not fret Elder, my body may seem weak but it is already rebuilding itself as we speak.&quot; Issac said, gesturing to the vines that were already attempting to grow back and his stone muscles and withered ice already spreading weakly back to their full form. Even his dicks and balls were slowly reforming back into their full glory as Issac breathed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Very well then, just be sure to not push your body, no matter how durable it is, too far.&quot; The Elder spoke. &quot;Marry herself is ready and waiting for you both outside, we have no idea of your personal requirements for sustenance but Marry has prepared about two weeks worth of rations and I have briefly trained her in some combat manuevers myself though as you might expect she is by no means an expert fighter.&quot; The Elder explained to Issac and Ilvir. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Very well, thank you Elder, also I have been thinking about your offer to purify the statues I carry within myself, while I mean no disrespect I would rather you not purify them yourself, instead I was wondering if I would be able to store them in here for the time being and reclaim them after defeating the Sky King?&quot; Issac asked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Very well, I grant you permission to leave those petrified statues here for the time being, just please ensure Marry herself does not come to any harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;I promise Sir, as my honor as a paladin.&quot; Issac said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   &quot;I do not know what a paladin is but I will trust you for now. Be on your way now, the Sky King&#39;s minions will arrive here to collect taxes within the next few days, and it would be bad for both of us if you were to be found.&quot; The Elder explained, leaving Issac and Ilvir to their own devices once more as he went up to go outside.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
      Issac looked at Ilvir, who was still supporting his body, and nodded. The duo both went into an empty corner, and Issac, feeling the weight of all of the statues inside of him, willed them out, pushing them delicately outside of his body, feeling relief as their weight left Issac&#39;s body, feeling himself shrink with each statue leaving his form.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
     Issac had stored about a dozen or so statues from the Basilisk&#39;s lair, having a diverse assortment of humans, demons, bird men, and even a single male centaur wielding a wicked looking two handed war axe. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
      Issac gave a sigh of relief, feeling his body losing almost two tons in weight, although he was still very heavy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
     Issac and Ilvir made their way outside of the Elder&#39;s cottage, seeing Marry, wearing a full suit of a shiny white armor, much more solid looking than the rest of land around her, a scabbard holding a short sword at her left, also carrying a large travel bag, fillies to the brim with supplies, waiting outside the door. At first Marry looked at Issac&#39;s shrunken and heavily damaged body with immense concern, but after Issac gave her a reassuring looks, she relaxed. Ilvir looked at her wordlessly, a hint of lust in his eyes, as he jerked his granite members off in front of her, although she paid him no mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Our Village Elder has left, saying he had other business to attend to, I myself am ready when you two are to begin our journey.&quot; She said confidently.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  &quot;Very well then, let us go now, time is burning while we wait.&quot; Issac said, nodding at Marry.</p>
