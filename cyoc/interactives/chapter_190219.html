<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish I was normal again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted.&quot; Gaz gave him a knowing smile, crossed his arms, and bowed his head. As he did so, a blinding flash emanated within the room. Truthfully, he could have done so without the theatrics, but he found the imagery made it easier for the humans to understand.<br />
<br />
Ryan shielded his eyes from the light, and as the room dimmed back to its normal brightness, he dropped his arm. &quot;Was that really necessary? You didn&#39;t do that before, Ryan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but those were smaller changes. This one took a little more horsepower, or whatever kind of power it is you use these days. I&#39;ve been meaning to ask what year it is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz continued rambling to Ryan, but he wasn&#39;t paying much attention as his reflection in the mirror caught his eye again. Ryan scanned himself over. He was expecting his original body back but for some reason still saw the older version of himself standing there. Although, it wasn&#39;t really the same version. This one was dressed in a well tailored suit that managed to hug and caress his features perfectly. The pants highlighted the thickly muscled thighs and muscular globes sticking out from behind him--something he would have never worn before with his old average body. As he was hands ran across the dress shirt whose buttons were straining to contain his massive chest, he realized even his hair and beard were coiffed in a more stylish manor than before. Ryan hardly even recognized himself anymore, he could pass for any regular businessman walking down the street. &#39;Well, maybe not just any regular businessman,&#39; he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you like the clothes I gave you,&quot; Gaz said giving a wink to Ryan. &quot;I have to say, you turned out better than I thought. But it&#39;s like they say, everyone&#39;s crazy for a sharp-dressed man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I appreciate the clothes, whatever. That still doesn&#39;t tell me why I still look over ten years over my &#39;normal&#39; age. I mean I&#39;m starting to look like my dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz thought to correct Ryan that it was more like brother now, but decided that might be a bit much at the moment. &quot;What do you mean? This is your normal age now. That&#39;s what you wished for, no? For things to be normal again. Well, now it makes sense for you to look like this. Have you not noticed the room around you as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Ryan turned his attention to what used to be his old apartment and noticed it no longer looked like the studio he was used to. This was a full fledge high-rise apartment with a panoramic set of windows that exposed the city below. Apparently in this new life he was able to afford a place like this. He walked over to what seemed to be his new office and saw his many degrees and accolades lining the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gaz, this place is huge! I must be rich as hell if I have a place like this, especially right downtown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What you thought I was going to let you grow up to get stuck in a lifeless office job? You&#39;re in charge of those people now. Besides, a man of your stature needs a fitting lifestyle to support you.&quot; Gaz said. &#39;Anything to sweeten the deal&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s incredible. I love this!&quot; But as his voiced echoed throughout the apartment, his excitement shrank. &quot;So, with a place this big, I must have someone to share it with, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, a CEO like you needed to focus on his job in order to get to where he is at this young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, damn. That kind of sucks.&quot; Ryan looked off to the distance. &quot;This life seems amazing, I just wish I wasn&#39;t so alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
A devious smile formed on Gaz&#39;s face as he uttered &quot;Granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what did you d-&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan was cut off as a voice came from another room. &quot;Hello? Mr. Desmond? Are you home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan walked out into the main living area to see standing there was his best friend from college, Carter. Carter was similar to Ryan before he changed. Dark, wavy hair, fairly average build, a little on the skinnier side, though to his credit he did have a boy next door image to him. Seeing Carter standing there, he looked more dressed up than usual. A buttoned up dress shirt, a pair of tan slacks, some nice dress shoes. None of it was well fitted, but he still looked good.<br />
<br />
Ryan looked over to Gaz and gave him a sharp side eye before he replied, &quot;Hey, uh, Carter. What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well the door was unlocked and no one answered when I knocked on the door, so I just figured I&#39;d let myself in since it was time for our meeting about the internship. And when I reached for... Sorry, if I overstepped. I just didn&#39;t want to be late, sir.&quot; Carter said, slightly flustered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine, dude. Just take a seat in the living room, I&#39;ll get us some drinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I can&#39;t drink yet, Mr. Desmond.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan looked confused until he remembered that Carter saw him as an adult now. &#39;God that was weird&#39; he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotcha, I&#39;ll just bring out two waters for the both of us then.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Ryan got to the kitchen, he tried his best to whisper &quot;Gaz, what the actual hell is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz appeared sitting on the counter. &quot;You said you didn&#39;t want to be alone. I thought seeing your best friend would cheer you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe normally, but he keeps calling me Mr. Desmond and sir. Plus he seems really nervous whenever he talks to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you would be, too, if you were talking to your father&#39;s boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Father&#39;s boss? I&#39;m in charge of that company? I&#39;m in charge of Carter&#39;s dad. God that&#39;s so weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you better go back over there. He must be so anxious waiting for you.&quot; Gaz winked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but once he leaves. We&#39;re changing this all back to normal. For real this time,&quot; Ryan said as he picked up the glasses of water. &quot;Maybe not the money, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Ryan turned around, he watched Carter&#39;s head quickly dart to the side. &#39;Had he been staring at me?&#39; Ryan thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man. Got the drinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ryan went to hand Carter his glass, likely because he hadn&#39;t been looking, Carter got up from his seat to take the water but his dress shoes slipped on the rug, sending Carter flying forward into Ryan. Before Carter fell face first into his hardwood floor, Ryan successfully caught him in his arms, but in doing so managed to soak the both of them in water.<br />
<br />
Ryan brought Carter back to his feet again, something that was easier due to his new muscular arms. As he did so, Carter rested his hands across Ryan&#39;s chest for stability, although, even once Carter was standing on his own, it felt like his hands lingered a little longer on Ryan&#39;s now damp chest. Taking a step back, Carter blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry, Mr. Desmond. I don&#39;t know how, but my feet fell out from beneath me, and then I just couldn&#39;t control myself, and if I saw you there I probably wouldn&#39;t have gotten up, and I know I should have been more aware, but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Carter. It&#39;s fine. I drenched the both of us in water. We can call it even,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;If you want, I have some towels back in my bathroom, and we can run your clothes through the dryer. I&#39;ll probably just change into something more comfortable if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t mind, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Again with the &quot;sir&quot;,&#39; Ryan thought.<br />
<br />
Ryan led the two of them over to his bathroom and grabbed some towel, which he strangely had memories of. He also handed a robe over to Carter since he didn&#39;t have anything extra to wear and none of Ryan&#39;s new clothes would fit him. Carter was nervous at first about changing together, but Ryan assured him that he thought nothing of it. Even so, Ryan still needed to change in his walk-in closet to get his new clothing.<br />
<br />
Ryan left the door open while changing, not thinking much of it, but he didn&#39;t notice that the entire time, Carter was sneaking peaks of Ryan. Carter was paying attention to every curve of Ryan&#39;s body as the individual articles of clothing came off. Carter imagined being in there with Ryan, getting to run his hands over the muscled legs trapped in those tight dress pants, feeling up the forest of hair on those massive pecs he felt earlier, this time without the shirt, having his fingers run through Ryan&#39;s impressively thick beard as he helped slide the tie over his head.<br />
<br />
However, Carter was snapped out of his fantasy as he felt a rising pressure down below. He saw as his tenting erection was pushing against the robe he had on, parting the flaps almost as if to put his manhood on full display. Embarrassed, and thankful Mr. Desmond hadn&#39;t seen him, Carter took a seat on the bed and bundled the robe in his lap to try and hide himself until he calmed down again.<br />
<br />
During all of this, Gaz was silently chuckling from the other side of the room as he watched Ryan&#39;s formerly straight best friend lust over his new manly body. And the best part was he hadn&#39;t even noticed yet.<br />
<br />
Ryan eventually walked out of the closet in a V-neck t-shirt and a pair of gray sweatpants. &quot;I hope you&#39;re alright with seeing me so casually. I didn&#39;t feel the need to dress up all over again if it&#39;s just going to be the two of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m no better,&quot; Carter said, laughing nervously. He was trying his best to not re-undress Ryan.<br />
<br />
Ryan took a seat next to Carter and draped an arm over his shoulders. &quot;You don&#39;t have to be so tense, Carter. While you&#39;re here, just imagine I&#39;m another one of your college buddies.&quot;<br />
<br />
The physical contact made Carter jump slightly. And it definitely didn&#39;t help the bulge underneath all that fabric get any smaller. &quot;Um, if you don&#39;t mind, sir. I need to use the restroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he waddled his way over, Ryan watched with a sullen look on his face. Gaz took note of this. &quot;Something wrong, Ryan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s Carter. I&#39;m trying to make it at least somewhat easy on him until he leaves and we can fix all this. But it&#39;s almost painful seeing him so closed up and anxious. I hope I&#39;m not a crazy mean boss or anything and that&#39;s why he can&#39;t talk to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re actually a pretty well respected CEO. I think it can just be a bit daunting for a 19 year old to be alone with a young executive like yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you&#39;re right. It&#39;d just be nice to hang out with the Carter I know, or knew, from back on campus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could always make a wish to help with that,&quot; Gaz said cheekily.<br />
<br />
&quot;With the way you&#39;ve been doing things around here? Pass. Besides, it&#39;s only for another hour or so,&quot; Ryan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, he&#39;s your friend. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to do something for him? I mean have you seen the guy recently? He&#39;s so nervous even the neighbors below can hear him shaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carter has always been a little socially awkward around new people. And I guess technically I&#39;m new company at the moment. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if he had a little more self-confidence...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz had caused Ryan to drop his guard again, and with that another accident slipped out from his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wish...&quot;</p>
