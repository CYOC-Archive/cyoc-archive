<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Four years have passed since my father&#39;s transformation, and in that time, I&#39;ve grown even bigger than I ever thought possible. It&#39;s all thanks to the genes that my dad passed down to me.<br />
<br />
At first, I didn&#39;t notice much of a difference. I was already tall and muscular, but as I hit puberty, something inside me shifted. My muscles grew thicker and denser, and my bones seemed to expand with each passing day. It was both exhilarating and terrifying to watch my body change so rapidly.<br />
<br />
My dad noticed the changes too, and he couldn&#39;t help but grin from ear to ear every time he saw me. He knew that his genes were responsible for my growth, and he was proud to see that his legacy would continue through me.<br />
<br />
Now, at the age of 19, I stand at a staggering 8 feet tall. My muscles bulge beneath my skin like boulders, and my bones creak with each step I take. My dad still dwarfs me in comparison, but I&#39;m quickly catching up.<br />
<br />
The transformation hasn&#39;t been without its challenges, however. Finding clothes that fit me has been a nightmare, and I often have to have them custom-made just to accommodate my size. And then there&#39;s the issue of everyday tasks - reaching for things on high shelves or sitting down in a regular chair can be a real struggle.<br />
<br />
But despite the difficulties, I wouldn&#39;t trade this new body for anything. The strength and power that come with being this big are intoxicating, and I feel like I can take on anything that comes my way. And best of all, I know that my dad is always here to support me every step of the way.<br />
<br />
As we sit together on our oversized couch (which we had to have custom-made just for us), I can&#39;t help but feel grateful for this new life we&#39;ve built together. Who knows what other adventures await us in the future? But for now, I&#39;m content to bask in the warmth of my dad&#39;s embrace and enjoy the simple pleasures of being the biggest son on earth.<br />
<br />
As the years went by, my growth only intensified, both physically and mentally. My muscles continued to expand, each fiber becoming thicker and stronger. The power surging through my veins was unlike anything I had ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
But along with my physical transformation, my mentality underwent a profound shift. The dominant traits that I had imprinted upon my father&#39;s personality became even more prominent in myself. I became assertive, confident, and unyielding in my desires. My once docile demeanor was replaced with a commanding presence that demanded respect.<br />
<br />
As I surpassed my father&#39;s immense size, it was time for me to take charge. The tables had turned, and now I stood as the dominant force in our household. My massive physique towered over him, and my muscles appeared more defined, chiseled like works of art. My every movement exuded power and authority.<br />
<br />
My dominance went beyond just physical superiority. Mentally, I commanded respect and submission from those around me, including my father. But it wasn&#39;t about belittling him or exerting control for the sake of it. Instead, I saw it as an opportunity to guide and protect my father, just as he had done for me in my earlier years. Despite my growth, I still held a deep respect and love for him.<br />
<br />
Together, we navigated this new dynamic, and my father graciously accepted the changing roles. He saw it as a natural progression, a passing of the torch from one generation to the next. He had always instilled in me the values of care and compassion, and I carried those traits with me even as I became physically larger and stronger.<br />
<br />
We would spend hours training together, our muscles straining and flexing as we pushed ourselves to new limits. With each passing day, we grew closer as we discovered new ways to support and challenge each other. Despite the clear difference in size, there was an unspoken bond that kept us connected, a mutual understanding that transcended physicality.<br />
<br />
And while I may have become the dominant force in our household, I never let it overshadow the love and admiration I held for my father. I still respected his wisdom and valued his guidance. Our relationship had evolved into one of mutual respect and collaboration, where each of us played a crucial role in the growth and happiness of the other.<br />
<br />
As time went on, my muscles continued to develop, each ripple and bulge a testament to my dedication and hard work. But it was not about dominance for its own sake. It was about harnessing the strength within me and using it to protect and uplift those around me, including my father.<br />
<br />
So, in this tale of growth and dominance, it is not a story of overpowering or defeating my father. Instead, it is a story of the profound bond forged through strength and the triumph of love and respect in the face of physical change. Together, we stood as a testament to the enduring power of family and the unyielding spirit that strengthens us all.<br />
<br />
As I approached my 22nd year, my size had become a sight to behold. My muscles rippled and bulged beneath my skin, each fiber as hard and defined as steel. My height had grown to a staggering 10 feet, towering over the trees in the forest. And my weight? Well, let&#39;s just say that it was enough to crush boulders and level mountains.<br />
<br />
My father, once the undisputed king of our family&#39;s size, now looked like a mere child in comparison. At 950 pounds, he was still a force to be reckoned with, but I dwarfed him in every way possible. My size was a testament to the strength and dedication that I had put into my training, and it filled me with a sense of pride and accomplishment.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t just my physical size that had grown. My cock, once a modest 4  inches when I was 15, had grown to an impressive 20 inches by the time I was 22. It was a sight to behold, thick and veiny, pulsing with an unyielding energy that demanded attention.<br />
<br />
As I stood before my father, his eyes widened in awe at the sight of me. He knew that I had surpassed him in every way possible, but he still held a deep respect for me. And as I approached him, my cock leading the way, he knew that there was no stopping me now.<br />
<br />
I could see the fear in his eyes as I loomed over him, my muscles straining and flexing with each step I took. But I didn&#39;t want to harm him; instead, I wanted to guide him towards greatness once again. And so, I reached out my hand and helped him stand up, my cock brushing against his thigh as we made our way into the forest.<br />
<br />
As we walked, my father&#39;s eyes followed my every move. He could see the power and dominance that radiated from me, but he also saw the love and respect that guided me. And as we reached a clearing in the forest, I knew that it was time for us to work together once again.</p>
