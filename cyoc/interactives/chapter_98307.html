<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall walked hand in hand across the intersection from Moon Lake High School and entered the town proper.<br />
As they traveled, Julie pointed out all the sights, however large or small, and told Eric everything she knew about the town she had grown up in. As a native born resident (and a were) she was proud of Moon Lake and wanted Eric to feel the same about his new home.<br />
Among other things.<br />
<br />
Their first major stop was the town library. While it had some of the more recent releases Eric was aware of from his local library in Minnesota, and even kept up with the latest CDs, DVDs, and audio books, Eric was surprised that the library had an old fashioned hard copy card catalog along with a computer system.<br />
&quot;Being a were-owl, the head librarian has been in charge since the 1950s. Although she&#39;s kept the library as up to date as budgetary restraints will allow, she&#39;s never seen the need to throw it away,&quot; explained Julie in a whisper since they were indoors. &quot;Besides, it does make a good backup system in case there&#39;s a power or computer failure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; agreed Eric, as they continued looking around.<br />
Before they left, Eric got a library card, but didn&#39;t check anything out (except Julie), since his book bag was already on its way home and he didn&#39;t feel like carrying anything extra with him. But he did take a good look at the library&#39;s science and reference sections, and was privately glad that they appeared to be current.<br />
<br />
From the library, the budding freshman sweethearts resumed their walk. In time, Julie was able to point out the Town Hall where, among other things, the Mayor&#39;s office was located. However, they decided not to go in and visit either her father the Mayor, or Eric&#39;s friend the Town Chancellor. Both were probably busy and besides, they wanted to be together (relatively alone) as much as possible.<br />
As they walked down Main Street, Eric couldn&#39;t help thinking about television and movie shows he&#39;d seen that were filmed in the 1950s. Except for the modern cars, parking meters, street lights, and the ATM at the local bank, Moon Lake looked just like any other quaint small town.<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t use the word small when describing Moon Lake,&quot; cautioned Julie. &quot;It&#39;s a lot bigger than it first appears, especially considering a good 70% of the town is actually open forest and woodlands, along with several parks and recreational areas.&quot;<br />
&quot;For weres?&quot; Eric asked with genuine curiosity.<br />
&quot;For everyone,&quot; replied Julie, emphasizing the last word before giving Eric a quick kiss on the cheek. Having been holding hands every moment they could, Julie added, &quot;Come on. I&#39;ll show you the local museum,&quot; as she tugged Eric&#39;s arm to lead the way.<br />
<br />
The museum covered everything concerning either Moon Lake specifically or Washington state in general, without ever mentioning the subject of were-creatures; but local residents knew the full story behind most of the exhibits. The town&#39;s founding fathers and a &quot;fit for the public&quot; version of its history were featured at the beginning of their tour. Local celebrities, such as Tachibana no Akane and the were who was a famous science fiction author (although no one outside of Moon Lake knew the real reason why he wrote so many adventure stories set on a world of anthropomorphic beings) were featured.<br />
Julie took great pride showing some of the nautical treasures her pod members found off the Pacific Coast and the relics they were able to bring back, such as parts of old ships originally lost at sea for generations, sea shells, and trinkets from days gone by that were lost in the ocean&#39;s depths until found and brought back to land.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a science museum on the university grounds. We&#39;ll have to go there some time,&quot; promised Julie. &quot;They&#39;re more up to date on the technological subjects.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure, no problem,&quot; said Eric, kind of absentmindedly, as he stared at one particular display.<br />
&quot;Is something wrong Eric?&quot; asked Julie, wondering what might be distracting him.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s that blue piece of sea glass in that display case,&quot; replied Eric, pointing to an exhibit of oceanic geology.<br />
&quot;What about it?&quot; inquired Julie, looking at the irregularly shaped piece of aqua-marine quartz.<br />
Eric turned to look at her and said, &quot;That unique color reminds me of your eyes.&quot;<br />
Then Eric made the bold move of kissing her, directly on the lips, right on the museum floor.<br />
<br />
Julie eagerly returned the passionate kiss, while stepping closer to Eric to fully embrace him within her arms, even as Eric ran his hands up her shoulders and began running his fingers through her long blonde hair.<br />
As Eric&#39;s hands began drifting down Julie&#39;s back, there was no telling how long they would have stayed in that position, with each participant thinking now was even better than their experience this morning by the school swimming pool; when a voice announced loudly over the museum&#39;s public address system that the museum would be closing for the day in a half hour.<br />
Eric and Julie reluctantly broke the kiss, but didn&#39;t let go of each other, as they continued to stare into each other&#39;s eyes.<br />
While Eric had created several analogies, comparing Julie&#39;s deep blue eyes to either the sea or the sky; he didn&#39;t know what she thought of his brown ones. Something else he would have to ask her in time. <i>Or would they turn blue if I became a weremer?</i><br />
The tips of their noses were touching, as Eric looked at Julie and said softly, &quot;How come every time I kiss you seems sweeter than the last?&quot;<br />
&quot;I honestly don&#39;t know Mister Anderson,&quot; replied Julie, as Eric saw she was actually blushing, &quot;but you won&#39;t ever hear me complaining if you&#39;d like more.&quot;<br />
&quot;I would love to M—&quot; and then stopped himself, for Eric was about to call her <b>MRS.</b> Anderson! Instead, he paused hesitantly, before looking at his wristwatch and saying, &quot;Would you like some dinner?&quot;<br />
&quot;I know just the place,&quot; replied Julie with a smile, before leading Eric out of the museum.<br />
If she was aware of his almost slip, Julie never commented on it.<br />
<br />
