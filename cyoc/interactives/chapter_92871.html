<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the truck finally stopped moving, Dan was pretty well confused and shook-up from the ride. As the doors opened, he glanced up, and the bright light initially blinded him. He heard footsteps and something big came between the light and him.<br />
<br />
 &quot;OK, mutt. We&#39;re here. Time for your shakedown.&quot; a man&#39;s gruff voice told him. &quot;Come on. Get up!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Dan saw a shadow move and felt something touch his upper thigh and a hand grabbed his collar. Then there was a painful sting where the thing touch him. Like an electric shock. The man dragged him to the door before Dan could even move his feet. He&#39;s dragged off the back of the van almost falling flat when he hit the ground. Fortunately, his feet were quick enough to get under him.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Move it, mutt.&quot; and Dan felt a another stronger zap of electricity against his other hind leg. Dan tried to look but was pulled forward by the burly man, Dan&#39;s legs scurrying to keep up. Both his thighs quivering and almost unable to move with his legs. As they reached a large area that&#39;s fenced in with chain-link, the man pulled hard choking him as he threw Dan against the fence and pinned him there with his leg while he unlatched the gate. Using Dan&#39;s collar as a handle, the man lifted and sent Dan flying through the air into the back of the cage where he crashed against it.<br />
<br />
 Dan fell down hard and collapsed gasping from being choked. It felt as if the collar was trying to be removed, and his hips hurt from landing sideways on the cement floor. Slowly he stood up and turned to look at his rear. Placing his nose almost to his ass hole, Dan licked the spot that still stung from the electric shock and then his whole hip and thigh that was now tingling from the whole ordeal. The licking made them feel warm and good, and he continued until his thighs began to twitch and a sharp pain swirled around his hips.<br />
<br />
 He stopped and pulled back to watch as his hip and rear cheeks began to shrink and his muscles began to pull his thighs up so they rested almost parallel to his side. This changed his walk from that of a crouching human or monkey to that of a true quadruped with haunches.<br />
<br />
 As he watched the end of this happen, Dan screamed, &quot;NOOooooooooooo.&quot; in another mournful howl realizing one of the last remaining vestiges of his humanity had now been lost. He again collapsed on the ground and began to whimper - the closet thing to crying he could do. He looked up and across at the man who had caused this. Short and in his dark uniform and cap that seemed to stick straight up from his head. Their eyes met and he could see a smirk on the man&#39;s face reminding him of someone evil. <br />
<br />
 The man turned away, and Dan closed his eyes putting his head down and thinking how Kat had caused this. Perhaps she was watching, maybe looking into a smoldering black pot of vile brew that worked like a TV for the evil witch she was. Her face came to him with a greenish color and dressed in a pointed black cape and hat like the Wicked Witch of the West in Oz, then seeming to morph into the man who&#39;d dragged him in. He was becoming delirious with grief, self pity, and pain when he again called for help from his mother in an even worse mournful howl.<br />
<br />
 &quot;QUIET, MUTT!&quot; ZAP.<br />
<br />
 Dan was surprised by another shock that stung his side causing him to spring forward across the enclosure with a yelp.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Why did you do that, Cathan  ? Your Irish temper?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;The mutt deserved it.&quot; he spat as he strode off away from the cage.<br />
<br />
 The woman had returned and entered the large enclosure to put down bowls of water and some dry food. Dan cautiously approached them and sniffed, then lapped the water greedily while the woman stood back. After Dan had drunk and gobbled up the food, the woman moved in to stroke his head and scratch behind his ears while waving some device up and down his neck.<br />
<br />
 &quot;That&#39;s strange. You&#39;ve got no chip. How are we going to find who you belong too?&quot; she posed to Dan rhetorically knowing he couldn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Probably some nice young woman that he annoyed and left exasperated at his antics and now is distressed that he disappeared even after the gifts she gave him.&quot; Cathan retorted sarcastically still with a smirk that made Dan wonder why this person was so mean and feeling Dan knew him.<br />
<br />
 &quot;No matter. We will wait and put the word out to other shelters in the area for when his owner comes looking. Until then, he is a guest here.&quot; the woman sternly replied as she left the enclosure and went out the door.<br />
<br />
 &quot;A fine guest to be treated as a dog deserves for disobeying the rules and his master.&quot; Cathan muttered at Dan so no one else could hear. Then he quickly thrust through the fencing with his electric prod and just grazed Dan with a shock as Dan was moving away.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I am watching you, mutt. Stay in line or ...&quot; and the man buzzed the prod sadistically.</p>
