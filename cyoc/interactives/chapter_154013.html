<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Considering it was their last year of high school, Abby and her friends wanted to make this Halloween memorable. Though there were a few limitations of what they could do. Since a few of them were still physically underage, they all couldn&#39;t go all out. Next year, when they were in college and legal adults, they would do sexier costumes. But for this year, they had the fun idea of half of them wearing old costumes and the other half wearing new costumes. Of course, each person had to decide if they were going to dress as something new or not. And they were also giving this Halloween bounty hunting thing a go.<br />
<br />
========<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it was kinda inevitable there would be one here,&quot; said Abby as she walked around the Brown Farm with Sarah. The harvesting was finished so there was plenty of room for Halloween decorations. Abby had opted to go with her princess outfit from the Renaissance Festival. It made her feel a little silly walking around a farm in a dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, where else would you find a cattle rustler?&quot; asked Sarah. She had gone for a vampire dress, the sleek kind that clung to her body and showed off a lot of cleavage. The main indicators that she was a vampire were the small bat wings on her back, the special fake fangs that were adjusted for her canine mouth, and two red dots on her neck meant to represent a bite mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hopefully our knights in shining armor are going to show up soon,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, your boyfriend&#39;s a knight, mine&#39;s a vampire hunter,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re dressed as a vampire because...&quot; prompted Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampires are sexy. But classy too. We have a little love/hate relationship,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please tell me you won&#39;t make a lot of innuendos about stakes,&quot; said Abby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but at least I won&#39;t when you&#39;re around. Besides, I&#39;m sure you want to see your knight&#39;s big lance,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sounding less classy by the second,&quot; said Abby flatly.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure there&#39;s a bounty to collect here?&quot; asked Pauline skeptically. She and Malice were at the Meat Market, or rather the Slaughterhouse. The adult party was definitely in full swing, people dressing in sexy costumes. Pauline was wearing her pirate costume from last year, which did emphasize her figure enough to be considered sexy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, don&#39;t you know that gangsters use nightclubs as fronts for their seedy operations?&quot; asked Malice. She was dressed as Red Riding Hood, but not the same costume as last year. This year&#39;s costume was a lot less conservative. It featured a very short skirt, a corset to put more emphasis on her figure, and the blouse had a deep neckline to show off most of her cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m suspecting you&#39;re using that as an excuse to come here,&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to lighten up,&quot; said Malice, &quot;You and JC won&#39;t be tied to Sophie&#39;s apron strings forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not dependent on her,&quot; protested Pauline, &quot;JC just sees her as his mother and I don&#39;t want to disappoint him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like we aren&#39;t going to see Sophie eventually,&quot; said Malice, &quot;But we can enjoy some time here with our mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know mine is dressed as a pirate, but what is Simon dressed?&quot; asked Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Big Bad Wolf, of course,&quot; said Malice, &quot;Well, Bigby Wolf, to be precise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; asked Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s from a comic called &#39;Fables&#39;. It&#39;s a good read if you don&#39;t mind characters from your childhood fairy tales being portrayed in different ways,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;My childhood was as a pet parrot,&quot; said Pauline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, mine was as a puppy,&quot; said Malice, &quot;So you don&#39;t hear me complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Though not everyone was totally interested in the bounty hunting. Jessica and Sophie were aware that this was basically the last Halloween of their childhoods, even if they were hardly little kids. So they at least were going to trick-or-treat one last time. The two of them made an interesting pair. Sophie&#39;s sexy aviator costume got a lot of comments. But she wasn&#39;t about to go flying around all the time. Besides, flapping her wings gets exhausting after a while.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jessica was wearing the same outfit from her first Animalian Halloween: Jessica Rabbit. Of course, things had changed between then and now. Back then, Jessica had recently converted into a rabbit Animalian, which boosted her figure, but didn&#39;t give her the legendary curves of her Toon counterpart. But she had grown up since and her figure had filled out a lot. If Jessica was a little more modest, she&#39;d be embarrassed by how much of her breasts were being displayed. And she was probably going to wear something even sexier next year.<br />
<br />
&quot;So after we get enough candy, what do you want to do?&quot; asked Jessica. She had sneaked a few pieces of candy into her cleavage for extra holding. Not the chocolate candy, of course. The last thing she wanted was melted chocolate making her fur messy and sticky.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking about that deep sea exhibit,&quot; said Sophie, &quot;Should be more interesting since we have more deep sea Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heard anything from Dino City? I mean, Jura City?&quot; asked Jessica.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m getting constant updates,&quot; said Sophie, looking at her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies, are we going to get more candy or what?&quot; asked Roland. He was dressed as a gremlin to go with Sophie&#39;s aviator costume. It mostly consisted of a green unitard, long pointed ears, and an aviator&#39;s hat. He didn&#39;t really care for the look of the gremlin from &#39;The Twilight Zone&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to rush, the night is still young,&quot; said Sophie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see some of those exhibits before they close,&quot; said Roger. He was also dressed as his Toon counterpart, though he wasn&#39;t as close a match as Jessica. It wasn&#39;t just because Roger&#39;s fur was brown, but he was, quite frankly, much better built than the floppy Toon rabbit. Jessica certainly appreciated how the overalls showed off his chest muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t close anytime soon,&quot; said Jessica, &quot;But I think we can take a break from trick-or-treating to look at some.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too long,&quot; said Sophie, &quot;We&#39;re not going to be young enough to do this next year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there will be plenty that we&#39;ll be old enough to do,&quot; said Jessica.</p>
