<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ms. Welles&#39;s office was on the other side of the school, so by the time Victor and Miles had reached the cafeteria, it was already 12:15 P.M. Almost every other student had already gotten their lunch and was seated at a table. Victor and Miles didn&#39;t mind, as neither were in a very talkative mood right now anyway. They both quickly grabbed something to eat from the lunch counter, paid for their meals, and found a small, intimate little two person table off in the corner. <br />
<br />
“OK, so what&#39;s your theory?” asked Victor in as hushed a whisper as he could manage in his new, mezzo-soprano voice.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” asked Miles, distracted. He had been staring at everyone in the lunch hall. It was disturbing him that he was slowly starting to become less attracted to girls. One of the girls that Miles liked, a perky goth girl name Kylie Perkins, was sitting within eyesight on the other side of the cafeteria. Usually her presence could be counted on to give Miles an erection no matter how innocuous what she was doing was. Now, while he was still enraptured by her appearance, it was more for her aesthetic choices than how attractive Miles found her.. He thought with slight jealousy about how cute her black crop top and red skirt went together, how well done her makeup was, and how she was so lucky to have Tyler Bates as a boyfriend. <br />
<br />
“Your theory! About what&#39;s happening to us!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right” said Miles. “So it all starts with this really creepy dream I had last night.”<br />
<br />
Miles began to explain what he thought was going on with his mother, and how he suspected that she somehow was doing this to them both. <br />
<br />
“Miles” said Victor flatly. “That&#39;s insane. You&#39;re saying that your mom is some kind of witch?”<br />
<br />
“Not necessarily. Maybe she got some kind of special power to make wishes or something. You know, like Pinocchio? Who the hell knows where she got it from? But it&#39;s the only explanation that makes sense. Why else would I have such a vivid dream about my grandmother?”<br />
<br />
“Because you miss her!”<br />
<br />
“Of course I miss her, but Victor, you don&#39;t get it. This was realer than real. I know how much the brain can play tricks on you, but this wasn&#39;t that. I WAS my grandmother.”<br />
<br />
“You were her when she was our age?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! This hair” said Miles, pulling on his long locks. “This was exactly her haircut. These clothes? Well, she didn&#39;t exactly wear this exact outfit, but I swear I remember seeing this pinafore in her closet. I&#39;m telling you, Victor, I&#39;m turning into my grandmother.”<br />
<br />
“Geez, this sounds like a plot for a bad Nickelodeon show” whined Victor, sipping on some apple juice. “Or that old movie Freaky Friday.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, this is by far the freakiest day I&#39;ve ever had in my life!” exclaimed Miles with bitter sarcasm.<br />
<br />
“So why am I turning into a girl too?”<br />
<br />
Miles shrugged his shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Maybe my mom hates us? Who knows. I got into a fight with her last night after I came home late. Maybe she blames you. Maybe she believes that you&#39;re complicit or something.”<br />
<br />
“So what are we going to do now? Run to your house and tackle her or something?”<br />
<br />
Miles sighed. He felt defeated. <br />
<br />
“I just don&#39;t know. I was hoping that there was someone, anyone we could find who could help us with this.”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
“Uh oh” said Molly. “They&#39;re starting to catch on to me. Well, lets see if they can pay attention now...”<br />
<br />
She began to chant a spell that would let the two boys know exactly what assets they were now carrying.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
“What about Lisa Conroy?” asked Victor. “She&#39;s Wicc...holy shit, you&#39;ve just grown boobs!” <br />
<br />
“What?” asked Miles, already on edge. He grabbed the top of his blouse with his hands, and by god, Victor was right! A noticeable pair of sensitive breasts were poking through!<br />
<br />
Miles started to breath heavy. Now he wasn&#39;t even noticing the transformations! These breasts were large enough that he would think he would have HAD to have felt them growing, but until Victor had just mentioned it, he didn&#39;t see them at all! Now he was starting to sweat. Was Miles having a panic attack?<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!” Victor yelped, just cutting himself off from screaming his lungs out in the middle of the cafeteria. “I&#39;ve got them too!” he said, also feeling himself up. <br />
<br />
Victor&#39;s breasts were slightly larger than Miles&#39;s own, and they could more than clearly be seen through the fabric of his green skater dress. His top had a rounded collar, so he wasn&#39;t displaying any cleavage at all, but it was more than obvious what was underneath. <br />
<br />
Both boys dropped what they were eating and ran into the restroom. <br />
<br />
Option 1: Miles and Victor take their tops off and begin to examine their new breasts in one of the girl&#39;s restroom stalls, both panicking over how they didn&#39;t notice their breasts earlier. Somebody eventually walks in and notices the two of them behind the stall, thinking that they are making out with each other. During History, rumors start spreading that Nellie and Victoria are a gay couple. <br />
<br />
Option 2: The same scenario happens, but Miles and Victor are mistaken for smoking or doing drugs together, and they get sent to the principals office.</p>
