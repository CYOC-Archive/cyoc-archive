<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac is currently living a memory were he his holding hands with a older man as they walk through a familiar looking tunnel. Is it just him, or is Isaac&#39;s perspective a little shorter? <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Hope was a little intimidated by the idea of moving. She was happy with her rich house. But her dad was invited by a friend of his to move with him. So they packed their bags and moved from a beautiful snowy city to a yucky old cavern under a temple. They are currently walking trough a creepy cave. Her father was holding a torch to light the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, why do we need to move here? I like our rich house.&quot; Hope complained.<br />
<br />
Crawnav chucked a little. &quot;Yes, but Grevialus is a good friend of mine.  I&#39;m realy sure myself, why we are moving in with Grevialus. I guess it&#39;s just curiosity. Whenever Grevialus is involved, things always proved to be interesting. Besides, he promised that he and his other assistants will take care of you whenever I&#39;m working. I understand that it&#39;s not the most safest of work environments, but I&#39;m the only one who can take care of you. None of our family relatives are available at the moment.&quot; Crawnav reassured.<br />
<br />
&quot;But daaaaaadyyyyy. I&#39;m 8 years old now! I&#39;m big enough to take care of myself. I already know how to cook and shop. I can take care of the house while you&#39;re gone&quot; Hope whined.<br />
<br />
Crawnav let out a hearty laugh. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll will. But the world we live in is dangerous. Things gotten more frantic ever since the legendary warlock, Calmach, introduced magic to the world. Ever since, magic users and dark knight has been running around causing a ruckus. There is no guarantee that a dark knight will not try to rob the house with you in it. So it&#39;s best to take with me. According to the letter, the underground research facility should be full of magic users who are fully capable of protecting you. The converted cavern is also very spacious and has a large network of rooms. Grevialus has even set up  a room just for you. It&#39;s a lot bigger then your old room.&quot; Crawnav reassured.<br />
<br />
Hope simply nodded. After a few moments of walking through the caves, Hope got bored.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing before them was a sturdy wooden door covering a stone entryway. There seems to be a light behind the door and a lot of voices talking behind it.<br />
<br />
This must be the place.<br />
<br />
As Crawnav opened the door, Hope saw a bunch of magic scholars running or walking around the room, examining artifacts or conducting shady magic rituals.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the room was a eldery man wearing a green outfit. He looked like a mid-evil mad scientist. He must be daddy&#39;s friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grevialus! Sorry that  we couldn&#39;t come here sooner.  Snowpoint Mountain is a long ways from here.&quot; Crawnav apologized.<br />
<br />
The elder man referred to as Grevialus turned around. As soon as he saw Crawnav, his tired expression changed into one of happiness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crawnav, my boy! You&#39;re here! I knew you will arrive eventually! My assistants has found some artifact that I know you will love!&quot; Grevialus looked down to see Hope. &quot;And this must be your little girl.&quot; The eldery man kneeled before the 8 year old girl. &quot;Ha ha ha, you look just like your father if he was born a girl!&quot; Hope doesn&#39;t like the strange old man. He hid behind her father&#39;s leg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her name is Hope. I&#39;m sorry for bringing her here, but I&#39;m all she has.&quot; Crawnav answered.<br />
<br />
Grevialus nodded. &quot;That&#39;s fine. No need to explain yourself again. You made yourself clear in your letter that you wouldn&#39;t come if you couldn&#39;t bring your girl. This research facility is by no means safe, but I made special preparation to make sure she stays out of harms way.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grevialus turned to address hope. &quot;Young lady, your room is over there. Please don&#39;t mind the explosions. I personally made sure your room is protected by the strongest wards we have. So as long you don&#39;t open your door during work hours, you should find your stay quite enjoyable. I even made an extra point to place soul poof wards around your room!&quot; He pointed to a wooden door with a sigh with her name hanging on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now go ahead and unpack your luggage into your new room. Me and your father has important business to attend to.&quot; Grevialus suggested.<br />
<br />
Crawnav set down his bags. &quot;Go explore you new room. Grevialus and I need to discuss some things. Oh, and can you take my bags with you? I don&#39;t want them to be knocked around by the other assistants.&quot; Crawnav told his daughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes daddy.&quot; Hope responded. She grabbed her father&#39;s luggage in addition to the luggage she is already holding. She was stugleing to hold them all but she didn&#39;t ask for help. She is a big girl now.<br />
<br />
Crawnav nodded in satisfaction and begun walking with Grevialus down a long stairway.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the door was left ajar as she walked into her new room. Hope let out a sigh of relief as she dropped the bags. <br />
<br />
When Hope got a good look of her room, she instantly fell in love with it. The room was big enough to carry a house! It even had a stove for her to make breakfast for her daddy, And her new bed was so fluffy and huge! <br />
<br />
Hope jumped on her new bed. It even had toys on it! Hope jumped on the bouncy bed until she tired herself out. She soon found her self tired. The very self and very comfortable bed made it easy to sleep. So she closed her eyes, thus ending her first day in her new home. <br />
...<br />
<br />
The memory ended and Isaac was brought back to the red mental void. Isaac found himself pondering what he just seen. It seems he was just shown the origins of Crawnav through the perspective of his daughter, Hope. But Crawnav seems like a decent guy. It&#39;s hard to believe that he was the one who released the corrupt on to the world.<br />
<br />
What Isaac found interesting was that he found out who Crawnav was working for. A elderly professor known as Grevialus. Just what is Grevialus and his men are working on? What are they researching? According to the notes Isaac read in Calmach&#39;s Crypt, Crawnav was working on a type of teleporting spell. Was that what they were working on from the start? And the talk of artifact sounds interesting. Isaac wonders just what kind of artifacts they are studying.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, what does Calmach have to do with any of this? Doesn&#39;t everyone beleive he the one who unleashed the corrupt on the world? Then why did the notes Isaac uncovered back at Calmach&#39;s crypt was telling him that Crawnav was the one who did it? But then again, Crawnav&#39;s involvement was probably kept a secret. It must be easy for everyone to blame someone as well known as Calmach. So did Calmach had any involvement in releasing  the corrupt onto the world?<br />
<br />
Isaac may have a new piece to the puzzle, but not enough to form a complete picture. There are still a lot of pieces missing. Why and when did Crawnav made the Ring of Purity? And what does Angela, the deity of Purity have anything to do with this? Come to think about it, why is he being shown this memory at all? He thought he was being shown Angela&#39;s memory, not some little girl&#39;s memory. What does Hope have to do with this?<br />
<br />
While Isaac was wrapped up in his thoughts, Angela appeared before him once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angela. I still have questions. How does Hope and Calmach ties into this? How do YOU tie into this? And better yet, how do I tie into this!&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
Angela simply smiled. &quot;There are still more memories for you to see. You questions will be answered then. But I can clear up some lose ends from our last conversation. I mentioned how your soul was split in half and the void you left was filled in by me and the possessed armor&#39;s soul respectfully. The soul in your head is the possessed armor&#39;s soul. The red half being you and the black half being the possessed armor&#39;s. So why did the soul mirror show a completely red soul in the red soul gem? There is a reasonable explanation for that. Souls are represented by a wide array of colors. A single color can represent all kinds of characteristics. My half of the red soul represents purity. Your half represent passion. So that&#39;s why both halves of the soul in the halo is completely red. And as for why the ring of purity seems to upgrade itself whenever the possessed armor upgrades? Well, you still have a connection to the half of your soul with the possessed armor. There for, Me and the ring of purity has in some degree, some of the possessed armor&#39;s power. Just like how Dark Isaac and the possessed armor has some of my power of purity. That&#39;s why our ring went from a ordinary ring to a floating, glowing halo.&quot; Angela looked relived. It was like she was getting a weight off her back.<br />
<br />
Isaac blinked in surprise. He never thought of asking those questions, but those explanations were really helpful. But Isaac can&#39;t help but feel like Angela is dodging Isaac&#39;s questions about why she has Hope&#39;s memories.<br />
<br />
Angela, being a part of Isaac now, can read his thoughts. She frowned as if she was being accused of a crime she didn&#39;t commit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to dodge your questions. I just wanted to get my explanation about the ring and our soul off my back before I forget. Anyways, now is time for memory number two.&quot; Angela declared.<br />
<br />
Before Isaac could respond, Isaac was engulfed by another memory.</p>
