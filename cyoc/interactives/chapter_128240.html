<br />
<br />
It was a warm and sunny Valentines day for New York as all the happy couples went to and fro with their dates. Among the many happy couples though was Seph Meissener, a normal looking, brown haired guy, of 25 years old and recently single after his girlfriend decided they were drifting apart over the years and decided to end it over a text. Because of the recent sting of the text, Seph wanted to seclude himself in his apartment away from everybody and just play one of the thousands of text adventure games he had collected over the years but his Jared had other plans. Jared was a nice guy as anyone who knew him would say but he had a tendency to be both oblivious and overbearing at the most inopportune times such as now. Originally he wanted to just hang out with Seph and help him out in his downtrodden mood but when his girlfriend found out he was going around town she wanted to join as well leading to Seph currently standing outside Macys as his friend and girl friend bought some chocolates for each other. Unable to stand doing nothing while surrounded by such happy couples, Seph pulled out his phones and started to search for any new text adventures he had missed.<br />
Seph soon became engrossed in his search though and was unable to notice Jared sneak up behind him and ask what he was doing. Scared by the sudden noise being so close, Seph’s phone went flying into the air before being caught by jared and handed back with and apologetic smile.<br />
“Sorry Seph, didn’t mean to scare you like that, I was just curious what you were doing.”<br />
Unable to get truly mad at him, Seph said it was no big deal though it came out strained even while Seph tried to hide. Jared, noticing this realized his mistake and tried to find some way of making it better.<br />
“Um maybe coming out today wasn’t such a good idea, we can go home if you want to, maybe have movie marathon.”<br />
“No thanks Jared, you and Misty look like you’re having a great time, I can’t ruin that. We can always go and hang out some other day, until then, i’m heading home.”<br />
Jared tried to argue but Seph wouldn’t let him, eventually leading him to finally being alone as Jared walked off with while looking over his shoulder. When they turned around the corner and out of sight, Seph gave a sigh of slight relief before catching a taxi and heading back home. The ride took only a few minutes but Seph watched as street after street flew by even with traffic being slower than usual. Finally reaching his apartment complex, Seph payed the taxi driver and entered the small three storied building without even a sound to mark his entrance before heading upstairs and entering his three room apartment. Shrugging off his coat for the slightly cold air, Seph went straight to his bedroom, which was right across from the bathroom, and entered to see his small room with only a single built in closet, 1 king size bed, and a single laptop plugged in on a table. One of the reason for him buying a room in this apartment was the free internet access it gave him. Plugging in his now half dead phone, Seph noticed that he still had his internet app open. Unlocking his phone, and checking what was exactly on it, he was surprised to see the picture of a colored shadow with the appearance of some holy knight with wing on one side and a demonic warrior on the other with the title “Corruption of champions”. Surprised by the interesting title, Seph did a quick back track in his history to see that it was an online browser based text adventure though many of the words were smudged from Jared’s chocolate covered fingers.<br />
Remembering the title, Seph turned off the app to let his phone charge unhindered and booted up his laptop. When the screen finally changed to let him enter, he instantly searched for the strange looking game. After 5 minutes of searching and rewording his search Seph finally found the big play link needed to try the unknown game. Clicking it, Seph’s screen was taken to a large background with a parchment like look to it. Next to be noticed were the large bold and black letters that took up half the screen. Not understanding everything that was written, Seph ignored the information before going to instructions. like before, the words were large but still readable with the first line saying that it was just a standard save the world text RPG save for the apparent ability to do whatever you wanted.<br />
Clicking back, Seph went to setting next and saw multiple boxes with shortened words and now available information for it not even in the large blank area over top the choices. Deciding to hope for the best he chose the Debug option first hoping that any problems were fixed, Next Seph changed EZ mode to on since he just wanted to have some fun not do anything strenuous for his mind like some games did, and finally was hyper happy since he had no idea what it meant and he could just change it later. With his selections done, Seph went to new game selection and clicked it.<br />
You grew up in the small village of Ignam, a remote village with rich traditions, buried deep in the wilds. Every year for as long as you can remember, your village has chosen a champion to send to the cursed Demon Realm. Legend has it that in years Ignam has failed to produce a champion, chaos has reigned over the countryside, children disappear, crops wilt, and disease spread like wildfire. This year, you have been selected to be the champion.<br />
What is your name?<br />
_______________<br />
Reading over the backstory again, Seph couldn’t help but laugh at the simple nature of it. It wasn’t a rude laugh but rather of one of relief that it wasn’t some complicated drivel that someone concocted to try and get players by being ‘interesting’ instead it was short and simple. Seeing no harm in it, Seph decided to use his name for the character.<br />
Clicking Ok, he was given a prompt that asked for his gender, replying Man he was given a new screen that wanted to know what his body type was. Looking over the options and then himself, he picked lean so as to imagine himself as the character. Next was complexion which Seph chose light to match his own skin. Picking brown for his hair, Seph was brought to a new screen that stopped him in his tracks.<br />
You have short brown hair. Every person is born with a gift. What’s yours?<br />
Strength<br />
Toughness<br />
Speed<br />
Smarts<br />
Libido<br />
Touch<br />
Big Cock<br />
Lots of Jizz<br />
Easily understanding what the first four options were for, Seph was gaping at the other options with thoughts ranging from “What the hell is this?” to “Maybe this game is more interesting than I thought”. Still unsure about the other options, Seph decided to ignore them for now and pick one of the normal options.<br />
‘Strength obviously means how much I can hit my target, Toughness is how much damage I can take, Smarts will have something to do with magic, and speed will have something to do with evading attacks.’<br />
Thinking about it for a few seconds more, Seph decided to go with speed as his ‘Gift’.<br />
Are you very quick? (+5 speed)<br />
Speed makes it easier to escape combat and grapples. It also boosts your chances of attack and successfully catching up to enemies who try to run.<br />
Clicking yes again, Seph was brought to a new screen.<br />
Before you became champion, you had other plans for your life. What were you doing  before?<br />
Alchemy<br />
Fighting<br />
Healing<br />
Religion<br />
Schooling<br />
Slacking<br />
Slutting<br />
Smithing<br />
Whoring<br />
Ignoring the strange options again, Seph clicked on Smithing to see what information he could glean from it.<br />
You managed to get an apprenticeship with the local blacksmith. Because of your time spent their at the blacksmith’s side you’ve learned how to fit armor for maximum protection. Is this your story?<br />
Realizing that it meant armor gave extra protection, Seph clicked yes. In a flash, the screen was replaced by a much larger one with many words and stats held to the side. Reading through the story, it tells how you make your way through the caves to a swirling portal that leads to Demon Realm and how just by coming close to it your lust was raised by a fifth of it possible maximum. Stopping now and not continuing, Seph makes a startling discovery about the game he had missed before.<br />
“This is some kind of sex game.”<br />
Knowing what it is now, Seph was left in a conundrum on if he should continue to play the unknown game or stop and never come back. Eventually he decided to continue to play and see just how far the game went in its deviant ways. Clicking continue on his computer screen, Seph noticed a creeping darkness that had appeared on the outer edges of his vision, not knowing what it was, he was unprepared for it to consume him completely.</p>
