<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Chronivac let out a loud &quot;Bip!&quot; noise, and Jeff started feeling strange. Dean looked at him questioned. Jeff pointed towards his lower back. &quot;Dude, my back feels so strange.&quot;<br />
Just as he said that, the mechine buzzed, and a message appeared on the screen:<br />
WARNING! IT IS RECOMMENDED TO REMOVE ALL CLOTHING BEFORE THE START OF THE TRANSFORMATION!<br />
Jeff blushed in embaressment, and Dean just smirked at his discomfort. &quot;Come on, Jeff. I&#39;ve seen you before. And besides, dogs don&#39;t wear clothes, remember? If you want to be my dog, you should start by listening to me-and the Chronivac-and remove your clothes.&quot;<br />
Jeff was embarresed, but he did as he was told, and removed his clothing. Dean smiled. &quot;Good boy!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a dog! Well, at least not for now!&quot; Snapped Jeff in anger. Dean was suprised. &quot;Whoa, sorry, man. I thought it was funny. Take it easy.&quot;<br />
Jeff sighed. &quot;Whatever.&quot;<br />
There was a minute of akwards silence, until the Chronivac buzzed again, and a new message appeared: &quot;ALL IS SET! TRANFORMATION WILL START IN TEN SECONDS.&quot;<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; Said Jeff in annoyence. For how long will he have to stand there naked? <br />
It was like Dean read his mind. &quot;The transformation itself will take about half an hour.&quot;<br />
Was it a lot? A bit? Jeff had no idea. &quot;Will it ever start?&quot; He asked. Dean nodded. &quot;In any minute now. And-Oh, I think it&#39;s starting!&quot;<br />
Jeff could feel it. The strange sensetion above his butt turned into a pushing feeling. He looked at his exposed backside, and saw a little appendage sprouting just above his anus. Dean let out a laugh. &quot;Yes! Just as I setted it-looks like you&#39;re getting your tail!&quot;<br />
&quot;My tail?&quot; The appendage lengthened, and started sprouting brown fur. Jeff felt like another part of his brain has opened. He focused, and his tail starts wagging! It felt like a third arm!<br />
&quot;Wow, it&#39;s so cool!&quot; Exclaimed Jeff. Dean nodded. &quot;Hell yeah.&quot;<br />
When his tail has finnaly finished growing, Jeff faced Dean eagerly. &quot;What comes now?&quot;<br />
Dean smiled. &quot;You&#39;ll see. I think it will be way more fun if I won&#39;t tell you what&#39;s about to come.&quot;<br />
Jeff felt his legs changing. He looked down, and saw his toes was disappearing, His fingers grew thick, and soft fur started growing on them, changing them into dog&#39;s paws. Jeff lifted his right paw, touching it, feeling how soft his new feet was. <br />
His legs were next. Jeff felt itchy all over his legs, who started sprout brown and black fur. His legs got thinner, and in a &#39;Snap!&#39; they changed their position into a canine one. <br />
Jeff trambled, almost falling over. &quot;Its getting hard to keep my balance!&quot; He told Dean, a bit afraid. Dean laughed. &quot;Well, of course it&#39;s harder. Dogs walk on all fours, remember? You&#39;ll see it soon enough.&quot;<br />
Figuring out what he meant, Jeff looked at his hands, who just like his feet started to change into dog&#39;s paws. His armes shifted and changed, transforming into front legs.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s even harded now!&quot; Shouted Jeff, bot afraid and excited. He tried to hold a chair, but he just couldn&#39;t with his new hands-well, front legs. Dean smiled. &quot;Dogs can&#39;t hold things.&quot; He said. <br />
Jeff was about to respond, but a sudden pain in his back took his attention. Thankfully, the pain stopped almost immideatly, changing into a weird shifting feeling. His shoulders changed, and his belly was covering in brwon and white fur. As he rubbed it, he can&#39;t deny it felt good. Dean said ominously, &quot;Now you&#39;ll get to know what &#39;quadropod&#39; means!&quot;<br />
Jeff&#39;s back cracked and shifted, forcing him to lower down. He let out a suprised &quot;Yelp!&quot; as he fell down. When he tried to get back up, he figured he just couldn&#39;t. He new, canine back was forcing him on all fours. <br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re in the proper position for a dog,&quot; Said Dean. Jeff looked up, and saw Dean towering above him. He looked so tall!<br />
His back was covered in fur, and Dean stroked it. &quot;Hey! What are yoy doing!&quot; Demanded Jeff. <br />
&quot;You better get used to it, Jeff. Dogs get petted all the time. And doesn&#39;t it feels good?&quot;<br />
It does, but Jeff felt so humiliated, having his friend touching him while completely naked. He blushed again. Dean saw his discomfort, and told him: &quot;Well, don&#39;t worry about that. Dogs go around naked.&quot;<br />
Jeff let out an embarresed &quot;But I&#39;m not a dog! Not... there, anyway!&quot;<br />
&quot;Speaking of the devil,&quot; grinned Dean, and Jeff felt his privates heating. He looked under his belly, and saw his balls changing their position, and fur covering them. His penis changed, and a sheath formed around it. Jaff whimpered in shame. Dean, once again, said in a calming voice: &quot;Don&#39;t be ashamed, boy.&quot;<br />
Jeff was now completly a dog, except for his head. He felt his ears changing, and he rubbed them with his paw. He felt them moving up on his head, becoming bigger and triangular. Dean started saying something, and the sudden noise startled him, making his ears twitch. Since when Dean talked so loud?<br />
&quot;Dude, why are you yelling?&quot; Asked Jeff. Dean smiled. &quot;I wasn&#39;t yelling. It was your hearing that became much better.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, right, I forhauot...&quot; Started Jeff, finding it harded to speak, like his toungue was bigger. &quot;I hmmph ammmn saying that arrf grrr-woof!&quot; He said. Looking at his friend in terror, all Jeff could form were dog&#39;s growls and barks. &quot;Well, dogs don&#39;t speak, do they? But, don&#39;t worry. I setted it so I can understanded you-not like word-to-word, but I can get the general thing.&quot;<br />
Jeff calmed down. Dean really had thought on everything. &quot;Now, only two things remain...&quot;<br />
Jeff felt his nose pushing forward, darkening and becoming a snout. He could smell everything! He sniffed the air, each smell giving him so much information. He smelled Dean. &#39;Human, young adult, healthy, happy...&#39; informed him his new nose. &quot;What are you doing, boy?&quot; Asked Dean. Jeff snaaped out of his smelling. He looked down, and saw his snout sniffing at Dean&#39;s leg. He whimpered in embaressment. Dean only laughed. &quot;No, boy, I totally get it. Testing out you new sense of smell? Well, let&#39;s just wait until you finish transforming, and than we&#39;ll get you aqquinted with this body.&quot;<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes moved, and he closed them hard. As he opened them, it looked like the room was drained of color. He wasn&#39;t excactly colorblind, but all colors seem a little dimmer.<br />
&quot;Transformation Succesful. Time: 30 Days. Enjoy!&quot; Read the Chronivac, and shutted down. Dean looked at Jeff in joy. &quot;Well, boy, come on! We&#39;re gonna have so much fun together!&quot;</p>
