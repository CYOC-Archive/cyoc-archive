<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Mmm, you made from a mix of fruit concentrate, right? I like it.” He went ahead and gave his feedback while she was still mulling over what she’d done. “And its<br />
got some spice notes to it, too. That’s pretty exotic. Not sure about what I can promise you about the alcoholic part, though. Our gym’s got its image to keep up, after all.”<br />
<br />
“Julian?” She just stared back at him with uncertainty and concern written plainly across her face.<br />
<br />
“Uh...no, no! Don’t get me wrong, I loved it. It’s just, we’re not that kind of business.” <br />
<br />
She knew, of course, that this would be all flying straight over his head, but it was still a bit insulting to see how badly he could misread her.<br />
<br />
“Listen Mar, I’ll definitely put in a word about it to the guys behind the counter, but don’t be surprised if they gotta alter it to be more in line with—”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he stopped mid-sentence, right when his stomach made this kind of noise that reminded her of the growl let out by a savage bear. She watched on as Julian cringed while clutching his core and gasped when she noticed something huge pressing out against the front of his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Julian!”<br />
<br />
“Nnghh...!” He started panting like a dog and sweating profusely. “Mari, I—I want more. But not from a bottle. From youuUUUH!”<br />
<br />
Her mouth hung wide in terror as she saw his whole body getting bigger beneath his clothes. And she almost couldn’t bear how disturbing the sounds of his pained grunts were getting, almost like he was...aroused?<br />
<br />
“Julian! Oh my God, I’m so sorry. P-Please, wait here while I go get help.”<br />
<br />
“NOOO!” She heard him boom, almost roaring. “S-S-Stay here. I...I need—”<br />
<br />
Just then, the zipper on his jeans broke open and through it popped an enormous, throbbing cockhead, uncut and fully erect. Fascinated by the sight of it, he reached down and let out a soft moan as the slightest touch caused a thick trail of pre to start dripping down the side of its shaft.<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuuuckk!” He moaned as his enlarging, clean-shaven nutsack grew big enough to split the seams of his pants before weeks worth of bright orange pubes carpeted them in an instant.<br />
<br />
Marissa was stunned silent throughout his change while it unfolded, both in horror at the pain it put him through and with perverse interest at how much closer it was bringing him to her fantasy ideal. Some part of her hated admitting she found thrill in the way his chest became barreled to such extremes that it sent his shirt buttons flying off and the way that his bulbous asscheeks were spilling out the top of his belt line at the same time they were showing through the torn fabric underneath. And even when he began thrashing around the room in a wild rage, leaving dents in the lockers and walls, the feat only made her want him more. <br />
<br />
When he stopped to rip away what remained of his pants, howling as his powerful thighs felt the air, her heart skipped a beat for him. But her rapt observation also made her realize that Julian was subtly getting less and less human as this went on. His feet tore through his high-quality athletic shoes and continued to grow to cartoonish size along with his hands, which he would soon need for the task of jerking off his massive new schlong. Thick body hair was spreading all over and growing into a light, sweat-drenched pelt. <br />
<br />
Julian’s primitive, enhancer form was a thing of wonder to her. As his arms elongated and his sides expanded, he was forced to take on a posture much like a gorilla’s. His brow became thick and heavy like that of a caveman, and his jaw jutted out into a snarling muzzle filled with menacing teeth. His ears became pointed, while his soft, conditioned hair spilled down over his shoulders becoming something akin to a mane. Sometime in the middle of his rampage, a destroyed locker caught onto his shirt and tore it off, revealing a massive, wooly chest with convulsing pecs larger than Marissa’s head. The change also let him keep his same general physique throughout, looking like a superhero whose limbs had been blown way out of proportion.<br />
<br />
He came near her, looming easily above seven feet, and for a moment, Marissa was afraid this was the end of her. But then, she heard him inhale deep, felt his panting breath blowing against her lowered head, and realized what he was doing. He only wanted to smell her, just like he was doing before, in fact, letting him now seemed to calm him a little. And that’s when she picked up on something important: she understood how the tonics worked now.<br />
<br />
“Marrr...Me like Mar. So good...” Julian snorted in ecstasy before falling back and straddling a bench. He then proceeded to jack himself off. “Mmm...like Mar...good girl...like n-nice tits...Augh!”<br />
<br />
She watched his first release as a wildman, his cum shooting high enough to hit the ceiling. It was intense and fantastical, and every part of his quivering figure said it was all for her. Some part of Marissa knew he was her beta, which meant from here this could go any way she wanted it to.<br />
<br />
Thinking quick on her feet, Marissa decided to...</p>
