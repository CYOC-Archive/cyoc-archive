<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Betty lead Jen down some more unfamiliar hallways. As they walked, she could feel what was left of the fake cum dribbling out of her pussy and running down her thighs which slid slickly against each other. It wasn&#39;t an unpleasant feeling, but Jen did wonder if she would be given a chance to clean up. Her mom had bathed her yesterday, but her long walk early that morning followed by her session with the sex machine had left her quite sweaty and smelling of sex. Her tail made things worse. The shifting plug in her ass kept in a constant state of low-level arousal that just served to add more fluids to the mix.<br />
<br />
As they walked, another smell began to edge out Jen&#39;s own. One of good, hearty food being cooked. Betty pushed open a door and let Jen into the school&#39;s kitchen. The room was quite large, even for an industrial kitchen. It had been designed with the idea that it would be providing food for both the employees and the dogs. Jen vaguely remembered someone saying that Amelia sometimes held parties and other events in one of the halls. The kitchen certainly was big enough for catering. There were five cooks bustling around, cleaning up after lunch and starting prep for dinner. One of them, a large man with a tall chef&#39;s hat, saw Betty and Jen and came over.<br />
<br />
&quot;How may I help you ladies.&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just bringing Jen around for a treat.&quot; Betty said, &quot;She started our advanced course today and has been doing exceptionally well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Of course.&quot; The man looked down at Jen with an appraising eye. &quot;I see you enjoyed our special food paste. I designed the base for it. It was quite tricky. No matter what I did, it always came out horribly bitter. All my attempts at sweetening it just made it worse. Miss Amber, my sous chef, was the one to finally crack it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Amber around?&quot; asked Betty. &quot;She said she was working on some other things and I thought that Jen here might be the perfect test subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has commandeered the night kitchen since Mina has been... busy elsewhere. You can probably find her there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Jim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty turned towards the door. As Jen turned to follow, Jim pulled something from his apron pocket and tossed it to her. Jen fielded it just like a dog would, catching it in her mouth. It was a scrap of jerky. Good jerky too, not the mass-produced stuff you get in the supermarket. Betty turned back to see why Jen had stopped and saw her chewing happily. She gave Jim a severe look.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he said in mock innocence. &quot;You said she&#39;d earned a treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty just rolled her eyes and took Jen out of the kitchen before she could be spoiled further. They walked further down the corridor and Betty opened another door. The kitchen beyond was a lot smaller than the previous one, but was set up much the same. A young woman was standing at the stove, stirring a large pot. She looked up and smiled at Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Betty!&quot; She said. &quot;What brings you all the way down here? Miss lunch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I enjoyed my lunch very much. I&#39;m just here to introduce you to Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Is this *the* Jen? The one who inspired Amelia to start a whole new program training people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Jen this is Amber, one of our chefs. She helped develop all the food you have eaten while you&#39;ve been staying here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked up at Amber. She was older than Jen, probably mid-twenties, and was dressed in black slacks and a white chef&#39;s coat with an apron over it. A tall chef&#39;s hat completed the ensemble. She turned the stove off and moved the pot to a cooler spot before walking over to crouch down next to Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Jen.&quot; She said, ruffling Jen&#39;s hair. &quot;It&#39;s nice to finally meet you. I would have come and said hi during your last stay, but Amelia ordered no contact except with the trainers. Is she allowed to speak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Betty said. &quot;She&#39;s already graduated from our basic program and though she&#39;s currently in our special advanced course it&#39;s in more of a testing role. I wanted to get some feedback on it from someone who isn&#39;t as obsessive as Mina.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; Amber trilled, looking Jen over. &quot;I see you&#39;ve already sampled our special feed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen jumped a bit as Amber ran a finger across her inner thigh and held it up for inspection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Consistency is still good.&quot; She said, rubbing her fingers together. &quot;How did you like the taste?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; Jen hesitated, not entirely comfortable with speaking. &quot;It was alright, I guess, but... I didn&#39;t really get to try any of it before it was... uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Slung up you like a drunken prostitute?&quot; Amber said with a cheeky grin. &quot;That was Mina&#39;s idea, of course. The girl is insatiable. We only made the stuff because she kept trying to suck off every guy she saw. The male trainers were starting to complain. When we first fed it to her she nearly drowned herself trying to suck it down. Supposedly it tastes just like the real stuff. If the guy is eating the right diet, that is. I wouldn&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never tried the real stuff myself. You want some fresh? You can tell me how the taste compares to your earlier meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up and walked over to a tall steel cabinet. Light steam billowed out when she opened it. Inside where several large vats. The young chef ladled the contents of one into a bowl which she placed in front of Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it a second to cool.&quot; she said. &quot;It keeps well, but only if I keep it hot. Once it cools it only has a few hours before it reduces itself to a thick paste that&#39;s difficult to scrub off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen waited a bit, then carefully lapped at the white goo in the bowl. It was tasty, but it lacked the depth of flavor that her earlier meal had. She tried to finish it all, but she was still quite full from lunch. Amber took the bowl and rinsed it out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how does it compare?&quot; Amber asked, drying her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... Not as good.&quot; Jen murmured, licking her lips. &quot;No offense, but it tastes better after... after...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it.&quot; Amber sighed. &quot;Don&#39;t ask me why though. The few other people I&#39;ve convinced to taste it both ways agree that it&#39;s somehow better afterwards. I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why so I could make it without such unsanitary methods. I would appreciate it if you could stop by here every once in a while and sample some of my experiments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be sure to do so.&quot; Betty said. &quot;In the meantime, Jen here has earned a treat. Any ideas on what we could give her? Maybe you have some other experiments you&#39;d like to share?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot; Amber mused, tapping her chin.</p>
