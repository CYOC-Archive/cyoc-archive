<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Damn it Jay!&#39; Sean thought. &#39;I cant think straight!&#39; Sean thought in Rains body. Wait if he could think straight as Sean but not Rain perhaps . Rather she could reverse this, however the breast size is nice. &quot;Please change... me back.&quot; Rain begged.<br />
<br />
Jay looked down at Rain who sat back on her bed. Jay looked at her. &#39;Well perhaps i could give her IQ back at least.&#39; Jay opened her profile to look at IQ. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll change one thing for you.&quot; He smiled. Shifting her IQ back to 120. At that point Rain felt her thoughts and knowledge come back.<br />
<br />
Jay then saw what time it was. Jay then saved the Rains Profile and turned off the program before he shut off the computer. &#39;Guess i have to go to bed.&#39; She then turned and walked towards his room to go to bed. &#39;She&#39;s not Sean so she wouldn&#39;t even know his password,&#39; Jay thought. He may not but he would call his friend about it to share thing about this new girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Rain couldn&#39;t believe it. Jay forgot to take her into him room or even to into another room. She walked over to the door and locked the door shut. Now, Jay couldn&#39;t do anything to her yet she still felt so much pleasure. Annoyingly. She stepped back to the computer to turn her p on all the while fighting the pleasure she was getting.<br />
<br />
She put in her password and turned the program back on. Opening her profile she started to look through the setting. Eventually she found the settings for her body. She turned down the sensitivity on her breasts go whole an turned back the the sensitivity for her ass back to a normal level. After a few more minutes she removed all the high sensitivity. she then quickly saved the setting of her profile.<br />
<br />
Instantly all the pleasure than she was feeling went away. Now luckily it seemed that Sean was hidden in the back of her mind. Right now Sean was grateful that Rain&#39;s original mind was intact. Export. The word caught her attention. hovering over it she read that: Export the profile as a preset.<br />
<br />
&#39;perfect,&#39; Rain thought. With this maybe she could apply her form to Jay for revenge. Clicking it a new window opening to save the profile. She saved it in the present as Jay sexual form, at this point she could make him Jay and this form. Then she looked at at the transformation presets. She wanted her old form back. At least there was a way to become Rain again. Clicking the transform into the goth preset. She her breasts shrink and her ass shrink. Slowly her body reseted back into her goth form. Looking at her old familiar form she put her hands to her smaller C breasts.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ok well,&#39; She thought. &#39;I did like the larger breasts but first.&#39; She turned around to look at the profile of her. THem was a original state. Looking at it. It contain her male Sean form. &#39;Well I&#39;ll save that for a back up.&#39; She then clicked on it and a new window. On it it read:<br />
<br />
You can revert back to your normal form. However you can also save this as a form that you can shift to at anytime in the profile menu. Also you can lock it with a password so no one else can change it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I better lock it.&quot; Rain choose lock as ORIGINAL STATE SEAN. After saving it she looked at the goth form once again. Looking at the breast size she increased it. &#39;But how big.&#39; She increased the slider to hit about the size of a basket ball. &quot;That&#39;ll work,&quot; She read the sensitivity and kept it down to 20%. Saving it she felt her breasts expand till thy reached their new basket ball size. &quot;Perfect,&quot; Rain put her hands to touch her breasts. Smirking she looked back at the profile. Now She needed to shift it so it was as if she was always Rain Blackfeather. Looking around she eventually found a reality shirt.<br />
<br />
ON it it stated that it shifting reality so everyone would remember her as Rain Blackfeather. Changing it and saving it she felt nothing but it was better now. At least nothing else would happen like with Jay but she now needed to do something to him. First she looked at the profile list. Not surprisenly she found Jay on it opening it she looked for apply preset she saved earlier. She eventually found it. Clicking on apply preset she looked through them till she found. Apply Custom Presets. Looking at it she clicked it after a minute.<br />
<br />
She saw the Jay sexual form. Applying it she saw a new tab above the profile window appear. Labeled Jay form two. &quot;Looks like i can set it as Jays new form.&quot; Rain then saw he had an list of form like her profile did. She then looked through the new form. She then looked through it. She decided to apply the same thing that she did to her. She maxed out the sensitivity of her ass, breasts, sex. Looking up at it she saw that at the top said: Apply Form. &quot;I&#39;ll leave that off. But first before I finish.&quot; She saved the form. She looked over to Jays form. She looked around to find an option. Memory. Looking at it she found that she could remove the memory of what happened to her from Jays mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; Sean said through Rain. It was like he was the control of the character Rain.<br />
<br />
Removing the last hour when he changed her she applied it. &quot;Now for the revenge!&quot; On THe new form for Jay she clicked apply form. A new window opened to ask if these setting were to be applied. She clicked yes. Now all she had to do was wait. &#39;Wait its 11 at night.&#39; She finished what she was doing when was about to close it she saw a new window appear saying applying settings. Waiting a few more minutes she saw it say compete. &quot;Now He&#39;ll be his DREAM GIRL,&quot; Rain Stressed the two last words. She then closed the program and turned off her PC before she went to bed.</p>
