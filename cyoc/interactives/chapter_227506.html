<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the first time since the fury flu pandemic of 2023, a winter snow storm blanketed the Pacific Northwest. Some theorized that because the population went from eight billion plus to around four billion five hundred; the reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide being put out has started to cool down planet. Others theorize that since fury’s love nature so much, that many have gone through steps to re-plant trees; restoring forest canopies that were cut back for lumber, land for farming or cattle ranching. All agree that those that benefited the most from the unexpected winter wonderland were the cubs that were born after the pandemic. The rush of the cool air on their thick winter fur coats; dense feathers and extra layers of fat for the avian and reptilian furies respectively. The crunch of snow on their paws as they playfully gambled about, making snow forts, toboggan rides and the various snow ball fights.<br />
<br />
Because furies were not affected by the cold as much as humans were, most had the thermostats of their houses set low; keeping  the temperature warm enough not cause pipes to burst and freeze. This didn’t mean they preferred to remain cold all the time; most found it comfortable to keep homes at a comfortable ten degrees Celsius or 50 degrees Fahrenheit; only turning up the temperature when the weather dips to the extreme colds. One of the issues furies faced during winter was road salt being used to make roads and sidewalks safe to travel on. Furies who walked on paw pads or bird like talons would always curse and growl when they stepped on a granule; not only would the mineral hurt the bare flesh but would also cause mild burns. While this was a minor inconvenience, it was sufficient enough to force scientists to come up with new ways to melt ice and snow without using caustic chemicals.<br />
<br />
“Snow,” Adam beamed as he made a mad dash out into the back yard; the young anthro cougar cub ran into the snow before diving into a large bank of it that formed near the fence bordering his parents place as well as his older sister’s yard. The young cub popping his head out as his fur holds back the white snow made for a photogenic moment as Julian watched her son while sipping her morning coffee; she wasn’t fast enough to summon her phone to take pictures of her cub when he came bounding back to her, his tail swishing happily as his body has a modest dusting of snow sticking to his fur.<br />
“You’re not coming back inside,” Julian chuckling, “until all that snow on you is gone”; she places a hand paw on her son’s head and watches as her runes glow. The magic causing the snow to melt and evaporate as his fur dries. “One day,” Julian escorting the energetic cub inside for breakfast; “you’ll be able to cast magic once your runes appear.”<br />
<br />
Alison Heartpaw-Proudhoof winced as her paws landed on a cold floor; getting out of bed and walking to the bathroom, the anthro cougar fury was five months along in her second pregnancy. Despite both Jake and Brittany’s teasing that she was having twins; the expectant mother breathed a sigh of relief when her obstetrician told her that she was only carrying one cub. Sitting on the toilet and beginning her morning ablutions, Alison smiled as gently rubbed her baby bump. Getting up to flush and then use the bidet; the anthro cougar then hoped into the shower and sighed as the hot water hit her body after turning on the faucet. She soon began to grab her body wash and scowled as the bottle neared empty. Using the last of the contents to lather up and rub into her fur; the specially formulated cleaning agent was designed to help repel fleas and ticks, while ensuring the fur remained silk smooth and free of flakes. The fact that it was unscented was a bonus; as furies found out that the shampoos and body washes they used when they were humans had an offensive smell thanks to their more enhanced sense of smell. It took a few minutes for the foamy cleaner to fully wash out of her fur, before she turned off the faucet. With but a thought, her runes glow and the wet fur starts to dry as she steps out of the shower. She still winces as her paw pads make contact with the cold tile floor.<br />
“You may not be bothered by the cold floor much Jimmy,” the pregnant fury muttering; “thanks to your hooves. But I am,” Alison stepping out of the bathroom and walking onto the carpeted hallway. Pausing at the thermostat, she turns the dial up setting the house to be five degrees warmer. “And I bet our son is also not enjoying walking on a cold floor in the morning,” Julian adding as she hears the furnace kicking in.<br />
<br />
Heading downstairs to see a pot of coffee, Julian makes a beeline to it only to be stopped by her mate and handing her a mug of hot non alcoholic cider instead.<br />
“No caffeine for you,” Jimmy speaking as he places a hoof hand on her belly before adding; “and none for baby to be.”<br />
“Then you better have a hot breakfast ready,” Alison looking at her imposing anthro stag-deer fury for a mate; a fury who liked having a large rack of antlers while his twin brother kept his trimmed down. “And don’t touch the thermostat,” the pregnant fury sitting at the small table; “I woke up and shivered when my paws touched cold tile.”<br />
“Perhaps we should have paid for the electric infloor warming for the bathroom,” Jimmy spooning out a hot bowl of oatmeal; “instead of the extra skylights during the house renovation.” He places the bowl in front of Alison as well as a jar of honey and several pieces of toast. “I’ll go wake out son up,” Jimmy pouring himself a cup of coffee; the act making Alison whimper as she craved caffeine to help kick start her day; Jimmy noticing his mate’s amusing cries, he smirks as he takes a big sip before heading out of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“You jackass,” Alison shaking her head as she sips the cider; finding it tolerable, she pours honey on her toast. She was about to dig into her oatmeal when she had the sudden urge to add something extra to it. Getting up and heading to the fridge, Alison pulls out a jar of pickled onions; one of many jars of various pickled products thanks to wild cravings. Digging out a few of the tangy pearl onions she drops them onto the oatmeal as well as mixing some of the pickle juice into it as well. She starts to eat just as Jimmy S.R walks back into the kitchen with a sleepy anthro cougar cub in tow. Naturally Jimmy J.R’s cat Dickens was close behind, purring as he eagerly awaited his breakfast.<br />
“Pickle flavored oatmeal,” the anthro deer looking at Alison queerly; “Is nothing safe from your pickle fetish?” <br />
“Nope,” Alison answering as she spoons a dollop of the gruel onto her toast before taking a bite; “sweet and salty.”<br />
“Your mother is going to be like this for another four months,” Jimmy S.R placing a bowl of oatmeal topped with blueberries; next to it was a glass of orange juice and slices of toast. “Now to deal with the other purr monster,” Jimmy S.R finally looking down at the cat that was rubbing up on his legs; seeing the cat chirp as it stretches up the anthro as far as his hind legs will allow.<br />
<br />
“Is Michael still shutting down the restaurant after tonight,” Alison watching her mate prepare Dicken’s breakfast; quickly glancing at her son to see if he is paying attention before turning back to Jimmy S.R. The senior Proudhoof was planning a Christmas gathering and wanted to make sure the entire family would be available, so he made sure the plans were made while the cubs slept as he called his sons as well as Edward and Lucas.<br />
“Yes,” Jimmy nodding as he places the bowl down so Dickens can begin eating; “but there is also the after work party for the staff, so we’ll be home late. Jimmy you’ll be with Granma and Grandpa while mom and dad have a night out,” the anthro deer looking at his son. “try not to keep your uncle Adam up all night.”<br />
“What about Dickens,” Jimmy J.R pausing in between bites of food; “can he come over as well?”<br />
“Dickens will stay here,” Alison answering; “we’ll be home late, and this little scourge can look after himself for a few hours.” The female Cougar fury looking at the cat as he licks his lips after scarfing down his mixture of kibble and wet food. “Now finish breakfast up,” Alison looks at her son; “we have a busy day now that school is out for winter break I need to come up with ways to keep you occupied and active.”</p>
