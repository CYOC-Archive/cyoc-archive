<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After giving Darrell and Joan a tour of the police station; minus the holding cells which are currently housing several of Frederick parker’s men and Daniel Parker himself; Douglas Cooper was busy finishing up some paperwork before he decided to leave for the day, when a deputy came into his office. Hearing from him that Frederick Parker and his remaining men have pitched tents and are now camping by the lake; Douglas Cooper just shrugs his shoulders. While Frederick is a known mobster out from California, the man has currently don nothing criminal; that can be proven as of yet. Sheriff Cooper informs the deputy to keep him posted with any changes to the Parker situation.<br />
<br />
Douglas Cooper gets up from his desk as the deputy leaves. Looking at the photos on his desk; one of his friend and former partner in the Seattle Police force John Shaffer Senior, a werewolf who is now dead. The other photo that of his second cousin Darrell and Joan Morning Star. Darrell being Alyssa Cooper’s only son and Joan, a friend of Douglas’s wer-mer cousin. With Alyssa now dead, Darrell was all that Douglas had left for his family. The sheriff an only child to parents who died seven years past; Douglas became the family were via an unfortunate accident. Becoming a were-grizzly thanks to a woman he befriended; Douglas always wondered what happened to her and her family. Never telling on her that his entry into were-society was the result of being accidently swiped by a were-grizzly’s paw. Her family quickly leaving town shortly after he became a were-grizzly himself; Douglas soon became friends with a werewolf that eventually pulled him into law enforcement.<br />
<br />
Deciding to leave his office, Douglas passes by the gathering room where roll call for the night shift will soon take place in a few hours. Checking in on a few deputies that are currently filing reports and dealing with the mundane; Sheriff Cooper arched an eyebrow when a noise complaint came in recently regarding loud animal noises from the Anderson household. Chuckling as it came from William Anderson’s next door neighbor and elderly man who is a normal pushing seventy; Sheriff cooper knew what those noises were. He himself is experiencing the thrill of roaring out his climaxes with his were-tigress girlfriend Joan during an intense session of rutting; Sheriff Cooper instructed the deputy if another complaint comes in then send an officer over to ascertain the situation.<br />
<br />
“Let the Anderson have their fun,” Sheriff Cooper stating; “with the were-alert going on, there is not much else for were’s to do other than engaging in loud sex. I’m surprised this is the only noise complaint received through the entire day though.”<br />
Getting a hearty chuckle from the deputy; a fellow were himself, Douglas heads to his vehicle parked outside and proceeds to drive home.<br />
<br />
Douglas sighs as he thinks of the day’s events that have so far transpired. Chelnik Vladomir an ex Spetsnaz now a bodyguard for Frederick Parker was killed by Special Agent Brooke Reed as she and Samson Carter where on route to the Knight estate. Spotting the man, Agent Reed jumps out of the cruiser to chase the wanted war criminal. With Samson getting shot as a result; thankfully the bullet only wounded the deputy in the shoulder, Chelnik was soon killed by the FBI agent who was also a werewolf. Shortly after, Frederick Parker showed up with a lawyer to visit his son Daniel Parker. A man arrested for attempt aggravated murder and a whole other assorted charges from shoot Peter Talbot Friday evening; Sheriff Cooper knew the Parkers were planning something but couldn’t quite figure it out just yet. Enjoying the moment when he watched Agent Reed informed Frederick that Chelnik was a wanted man but not telling the mobster that he was dead; Sheriff Cooper loved watching the man squirm as he had a heated discussion with his son Daniel and the lawyer from Las Vegas.<br />
<br />
Despite a planning being worked out by Tachibana in keeping Chelnik’s body on ice for the time being; Douglas Cooper was happy that the day was somewhat peaceful. Pulling into his driveway and getting out of the car; Douglas was soon being attacked by a happy six year old kid who he only saw a few hours ago, Darrell latching onto Douglas’s leg as he tried to walk into the door <br />
“Uncle Yogi,” Darrell beaming; “your home!”<br />
“Yes,” Douglas helping the young wer-mer up; “and hopefully I won’t get called in for an emergency.”<br />
“Joan made supper but won’t let me tell you,” Darrell giggling; “it’s a surprise.”<br />
<br />
Douglas puts Darrell down as he gets inside. Getting a strong smell of chicken frying; Douglas knew it was chicken Kiev for supper. Curious as to what it is as he never ate before; Douglas heads to his room to get out of his police uniform and into something more casual.<br />
“Supper will be ready in a few minutes,” Douglas could hear Joan speaking as he decided to put on some jeans and a white t-shirt.<br />
<br />
Heading back into the kitchen which opened up to the living room; Douglas gets a close look at the food being plated.<br />
“Fried Chicken,” Douglas looking at Joan; “is that what chicken Kiev is?”<br />
“Nope,” Joan answering; “it’s a stuffed chicken that has been fried in a crunchy batter.”<br />
“What’s it stuffed with,” Douglas helping to set the table.<br />
“Herbs and butter,” Joan looking at Douglas; “it’s a very delicious.”<br />
“And fattening,” Douglas looking at the lump of crispy chicken.<br />
“No more fattening then a chicken breast stuffed with ham and cheese and fried the same way as this,” Joan responding; “which by the way is a sandwich less version of a cordon blué.”<br />
“Think of it this way,” Joan smiling; “all these extra carbs and fat can be easily burned off with a wild romp.”<br />
“Oh,” Douglas grinning; “and here I thought you wanted to wait until tomorrow evening.”<br />
“What’s having a little fun a day early,” Joan playfully growling; “this were-tigress is in a mood for some fun.”<br />
“Not while Darrell is awake,” Douglas smelling Joan’s lovely scent and getting aroused; “let’s just eat first.”<br />
<br />
On top of the stuffed chicken, Joan also prepared some steamed Brussel sprouts and a cold tomato salad. Darrell bounding into the kitchen with his usual energetic zeal; the kid was a little disappointed when both Douglas and Joan sat down and weren’t in their fursonas. The six year old was still having a hard time grasping the concept of a were-alert and why no one can be furry during it. Yet the tyke was assured that this emergency would soon pass and he would be able to look out the window after sunset and see several were’s in their fursona walking about.<br />
<br />
Supper was an enjoyable moment for Douglas. While the were-grizzly preferred to eat healthy; he could not deny that the greasy chicken stuffed with butter was delicious. Eating three portions well before the sun has set; Douglas felt full as he watched Darrell mix his tomatoes with the butter spilling from the chicken, gleefully making a mess as he ate.<br />
“Well you are certainly enjoying supper,” Douglas watching the kid eat.<br />
“I made this once before,” Joan responding; “but then it was more fried chicken drowned in butter. Thank goodness Darrell isn’t a picky eater.”<br />
“Yet he prefers to eat cheesy noodles whenever he can,” Douglas still watching Darrell as he finished eating.<br />
“Cheesy noodles for dessert,” Darrell looking at Joan.<br />
“No,” Joan collecting the plates; “but there is a few chocolate pudding cups.”<br />
“I’ll pass on those,” Douglas grabbing a glass and pouring himself some water; “to much sugar in them.”<br />
“Your lose,” Joan handing one to Darrell as Douglas drinks his water; “you want to go see a movie tonight?”</p>
