<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sheriff Douglas Cooper and a deputy pulled up to see a were-panther attacking a werewolf. While Sheriff Cooper recognized the Were-panther as Benton; he was unfamiliar with the werewolf. Deciding to end the struggle between the two; the Sheriff pulls out his stun gun and order his deputy to do so as well. Sheriff Cooper aims at Benton and fires a set of twin barbs into Benton’s hide; fifty thousand volts shoot through the wires and course through the were-panther forcing him to drop to the ground. The deputy discharged his stun gun to the werewolf at the same time; ending the confrontation then and there.<br />
<br />
The Sheriff in no mood for a repeat event cuffs Benton as he reverts to human form. Looking at Amanda Knight; “Please get your husband some clothes. I highly doubt everyone here is keen on seeing his junk swaying the breeze. Looking at the werewolf in underwear, he sees Spencer Lawson try to comfort him; “Is that your father Spencer?” <br />
“Grandfather,” Spencer sobs. Looking up at the sheriff, “was this necessary? Did you have to use force to stop the fight?”<br />
“I have seen enough fights between two were’s, little girl too know that if you don’t use whatever means are at your disposal to stop the fight; One of the were’s will be dead with their throat ripped out.”<br />
“You’re saying my dad would of killed Mike Lawson here?” Frieda speaks up while comforting a dazed and injured Eric Anderson.<br />
“That, or Mr. Lawson here would of killed Benton,” the Sheriff remarks; “He seemed to be holding his own quite well when I showed up.”<br />
“That’s because I was once a marine in the U.S army,” Mike Lawson groggily states; “What hit me?”<br />
“Fifty thousand volts of electricity,” The sheriff comments with no hint of humor in his voice.<br />
“The crazy ass were-panther attacked Eric just as we were dropping Frieda off,” Mike Lawson states as he struggles to get up. Now fully human, the underwear that survived Mike’s shifting is the only thing maintaining his modesty.<br />
“It’s true Sheriff”, Frieda responds; “Father attacked Eric before I could get out of the car. Look at Eric! Look at what my father&#39;s rage did!”<br />
<br />
The Sheriff notices Eric, while injured, he is still conscious. Several deep scratches are on the boy’s chest and are bleeding. The sheriff radios in for an ambulance he is about to radio a car to the Anderson household when Mike interrupts him. <br />
“Martha and William are at my son and daughter in-law&#39;s house.”<br />
“Cancel the car to the Anderson household,” Sheriff Copper states on the radio; “Direct it to the Lawson residence.”<br />
“Tell whoever arrives to brace themselves,” Mike winces; “My son, his wife and the Anderson are swingers. Don’t be shocked if the scent of intense sex floods their noses.”<br />
“Grandpa!” Spencer chides; “use some discretion!”<br />
“Sorry Spencer,” Mike states; still sore from where the barbs from the stun gun hit him.<br />
<br />
Minutes later Benton starts to stir just as an ambulance arrives; following the ambulance is a black limousine. As the paramedics jump out to assess Eric’s injuries, Benton sees Tachibana No Akane steps out of the limousine, followed by a person he loathes just as much as Daisuke; his younger brother Lance Knight.<br />
<br />
Tachibana looks at the injured Eric Anderson as he is being placed on the ambulance gurney, she turns to the sheriff; “Statue 1A violation?”<br />
No Tachibana,” Sheriff Cooper answers; “I know for a fact that young Eric there has been a were since last Tuesday. Just before Julie Stovall assaulted him and Frieda.”<br />
Tachibana turns to stare at a naked and handcuffed Benton; “you dodge a big bullet there Benton. But did I not warn you the other night? Harm the Lawson’s or Anderson’s in any way and you will be at war with the Skulk!”<br />
Benton was about to speak up when Lance who has been quiet finally speaks up; “With all due respect Tachibana I know my brother best. While he tends to lose control when angry; there are times he does regret his actions later. He is just too stubborn to let people know. He is after all a prideful pig-headed ass.”<br />
“Then what would you suggest,” Tachibana asks; “as the were-panther representative pro-temp until Frieda is of age to assume control of her father’s former seat on the elder council; Benton&#39;s fate is in your paws.”<br />
<br />
Benton was shocked to hear what Tachibana just said; his brother on ‘his’ seat on the council. He hated his brother; despised that he was the favorite son of dad’s. While Benton did get the lion share of the Knight business, he was livid that he gave Lance the juicy plumb that was Knight Media. He was so mad that he staged a rigged proxy fight to wrest control of the shares owned by the Crawford family. Shortly thereafter he re-brands Crawford and Knight to Knight Industries. His attempt to take his brother’s holdings further inflamed the strained relationship Benton had with his parents. The last time he spoke to them was just after Frieda was born. Now here was his younger brother staring over him about to order him about like a drill sergeant does to raw recruits.<br />
<br />
“Get on with it,” Benton growls.<br />
“Nice to see you to Benton,” Lances responds; “I’d ask if you want to further flush your reputation down the toilet, but I think you done that already.”<br />
“Eat spit,” Benton grouses.<br />
“Colorful retort,” Tachibana responds rolling her eyes.<br />
“Yes, that’s Benton Knight,” Lance answers; “Full of piss and vinegar. No room for compassion or remorse; a snob, through and through.”<br />
<br />
Amanda finally reappears with a pair of pants. She sees Tachibana and her brother in-law. Knowing things are not going to get better, she sighs.<br />
“Evening Amanda,” Lances states; “Need help dressing my brother?”<br />
While Amanda never liked Lance, she knew now was not the time to get into an argument with him; ”Yes,” She answers.<br />
“Sheriff can you remove the handcuffs to my brother?” Lance asks; “I doubt he is keen on doing something further stupid.”<br />
“You sure?” Sheriff Cooper asks.<br />
“Would you rather help put his pants on?” Lances quips.<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper sours at the prospect of dressing Benton, so he takes the handcuffs off. Benton grabs the pants from Amanda and quickly puts them on.<br />
“That’s better,” Lance comments. “Now on to business; I was about to attend tonight&#39;s elder council session when this activity of yours happened.”<br />
“Oh shut up with the speeches,” Benton gripes; “Say what you’re going to say and get lost.” Noticing Frieda climbing in the ambulance with Eric he shouts; “You’re not going anywhere Frieda!”<br />
Frieda looks at her father and responds by flipping her middle finger at him. She closes the Ambulance door and it drives off to the hospital.<br />
“Get out of my way,” Benton tries to leave; “I&#39;m following them.”<br />
“No you’re not,” Lance answers.<br />
“Excuse me?” Benton looking at his brother; “Who are you to tell me what I can and can’t do?”<br />
“I’m the one on the elder council,” Lance fires back; “I’m also the one who is tasked with mentoring your daughter to take her rightful place. Which means sit down, shut up and put up!”<br />
<br />
Benton about to attack his brother notices Sheriff Cooper readying his service pistol. Benton backs off but is clearly angered at the fact that his brother has the gall to order him about.<br />
“Assaulting a child is a very serious issue. To try and chase down the ambulance carrying said minor just to drag your daughter back her will not help your situation!” Lance shouts.<br />
“Your brother is right Benton,” Amanda sighs; “As much as I hate to admit it, he is right.”<br />
“Then what will you have me do,” Benton grumbles.<br />
“First, you will not ground you daughter for flipping you off;” Lance states; “Second, I know of your press conference tomorrow, you will have yourself composed and calm by then. I and the rest of the council will be in attendance. As of now consider yourself on notice; one more outburst, one more display of anger; any attempt to shift into your fursona for purposes of intimidation and all the money you have in the world won’t save you from the deepest hole the council will undoubtedly throw you into.”<br />
<br />
Lance turns around to head back to Tachibana’s limo. Tachibana stays for a brief moment; “You still have the previous edicts the council ordered you to do. Take care of them soon.”<br />
“Have they decided where I’m to attend anger management then?” Benton retorts.<br />
“That will be discussed tonight,” Tachibana answers; “Stay next to your phone. We will contact you soon.” Tachibana turns around to leave.<br />
<br />
All that remains outside is Benton, Amanda, Sheriff Cooper his deputy and a still woozy Mike Lawson. Spencer also joined Eric on the ambulance to the hospital. <br />
“Come on Mr. Lawson, “Sheriff Cooper comments; “You’re in no shape to drive. Get in my cruiser and I take you to the hospital to be assessed. You can pick up your vehicle later.”<br />
“I want that piece of shit off my property or I’ll have it towed to the junk yard,” Benton shouts.<br />
“Mike Lawson hears this and shouts back, “but what will your daughter say when she finds out you got rid of your trampy looking wife!”<br />
Benton and Amanda’s faces turn red with rage while Sheriff Cooper laughs; “Don’t worry, If Benton does anything to your vehicle Mr. Lawson, he have auto theft charges to deal with as well. Oh and one other thing Benton; despite being in your fursona; I highly doubt you are not going to be charged with assaulting a minor.” Both get in the police cruiser and drive off; the sheriff’s deputy following.<br />
<br />
“The nerve of him, calling me a tramp;” Amanda seethes.<br />
“Yes,” Benton responds; “Come let’s go to the hospital. Frieda is there and I want her home.”<br />
“You think that’s wise Benton?” Amanda responds; “Eric’s parents will most definitely be there; possibly Tachibana as well.”<br />
“Then what do you suggest,” Benton still angry.<br />
“I will go alone,” Amanda answers; “You being there will only make matters worse, More so if the Anderson what to press charges.”<br />
<br />
Benton just grunts as he heads back inside the house, while Amanda gets in her car and drives off to the hospital.</p>
