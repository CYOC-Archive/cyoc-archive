<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris and John sat there in the shade for what seemed like hours, lost in the newfound pleasure of chewing their cud. They didn&#39;t stop to think that they were doing what cows did. They didn&#39;t really understand what they were doing at all. They just knew that eating grass was way different and way better than they expected, and they wished they&#39;d discovered it sooner.<br />
<br />
Chris, for one, was glad he&#39;d never taken up learning and working at some honest craft like the respectable townspeople did. He wasn&#39;t even sure he needed to steal anymore, except maybe for winter. If he could just spend the whole day lollygagging with his buddy and eating the green stuff, what was the point of running in and out of houses, getting cut on broken windows, taking random trinkets and stealing foods that people only eat once? This was the life! Sure, he hadn&#39;t managed to get rid of that thing he&#39;d found attached to the top of his butt crack out in the woods, but it&#39;s not like it seemed to be doing him any harm. It pretty much did whatever he wanted it to, and honestly he was starting to have trouble thinking of it as some separate thing from himself at all. Touching it felt just about like touching any random part of his body, which was one of the things that had freaked him out about it in the first place. He remembered the old stories of snake demons that fused with people in body and mind, but surely those weren&#39;t furry? Oh well, if it was willing to tag along for the ride while he happily chewed up and swallowed his own puke, he wasn&#39;t going to complain.<br />
<br />
John, meanwhile, was pleased to find that he often felt more satiated when he swallowed a big mass of rechewed grass. Whatever was still empty inside him was starting to get a little more full, and he liked it. It was almost like he had discovered a whole other stomach down inside himself: one for eating the grass, and another for eating the grass again. It was so weird. He couldn&#39;t really imagine any other food he&#39;d eaten doing this for him, and he really didn&#39;t want to go back other food if he could help it. He didn&#39;t even make the connection to his black, bovine-looking ears. After all, what would his ears have to do with what was happening in his belly? Anyway, he had another bodily function to focus on right at the moment. John swallowed his cud again and said, &quot;Alright Chris it&#39;s my turn to piss. I&#39;ll be right back man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before he got very far, he felt weird and dizzy again and heard Chris groaning back behind him. Whatever it was wore off as quickly as it had before, and looking over himself and feeling around his head again he didn&#39;t find anything else different, so he decide not to worry about it. He walked over a few more yards, pulled down his pants, and gasped!<br />
<br />
* Where is my dick?! * John thought. He couldn&#39;t even bring himself to scream. That wasn&#39;t all, either. There were for little pink lumps where his penis used to be which looked sort of like bug bites, except really they looked and felt even more like his nipples. pulling up his top, he found that his actual nipples were gone from his chest. Apparently, they had been replaced by these FOUR down below! And yet, even though he didn&#39;t have a penis, he felt like he could still pee, and like he had to, so he tried. The stream trickled out from a new whole somewhere near his ass. When he finished, he just left his clothes off and went yelling back up toward the meadow.<br />
<br />
&quot;CHRIS! CHRIS!&quot; He yelled. &quot;Something&#39;s wrong! Did it happen to you? You gotta see this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris jumped and looked at his naked friend. &quot;Dude, chill out, what is it, and where your clothes--OH!&quot; Chris noticed that he was not looking at male genitalia and realized what Chris was trying to show him. He quickly looked down in his own pants and breathed a sigh of relief. Everything was normal for him there for now. But John was looking at him like something else was the matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Chris, you&#39;re head, you ... you ...&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching his hands up to where John was pointing and stammering, Chris felt a pair of hard growths up above his still-human ears. What could they be? Did they have something to do with the furry snake demon? He could easily get a good solid grip on them, but they were much to firmly rooted in his skull to even budge. Could he even discuss this with John without admitting that John might have been right about some of the old superstitions?<br />
<br />
John was just about to lose it and didn&#39;t even know what to say. What COULD he say? He had animal ears and wasn&#39;t even a male anymore, and his friend had HORNS and a fucking tail. Was this their punishment for a life of crime? It was like everything Chris told him not to believe in, happening all at once.</p>
