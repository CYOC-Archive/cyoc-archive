<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I don&#39;t know the exact medical science behind it, but basically you don&#39;t have one, you&#39;re just weird.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; asked Kyle, hoping his mom would elaborate slightly.<br />
&quot;I mean no offense honey, you&#39;re just a bit weird is all. You&#39;ve always been a little weird, but ever since puberty you seem to have just focused all of that weirdness into sexual energy. Everybody, myself included, got so sick of trying to get you to stop masturbating constantly, so we just stopped trying all together.&quot; replied his mom. Kyle began wondering how that even worked. If he doesn&#39;t have any sort of condition how is he allowed to just masturbate in front of somebody.<br />
&quot;I guess what I don&#39;t understand is why I&#39;m even allowed to masturbate in front of you. People don&#39;t do that, right?&quot; asked Kyle, genuinely concerned that he had somehow made it okay for people to masturbate in front of their parents.<br />
&quot;No, of course people don&#39;t do that Kyle. At least normal people don&#39;t. Don&#39;t be ridiculous. There&#39;s no particular reason that you&#39;re allowed to, you just are. I wouldn&#39;t complain about it too much if I were you. Seems nice to have that level of freedom to me.&quot; This only raised more question in his mind. He supposed that him changing what was normal for him must have left a few logical gaps. Other people didn&#39;t regularly jack off in front of other people, it was just him, and for some reason he didn&#39;t need a reason to be allowed to, everybody just accepted that as fact. Reality had altered to give him alone special privileges. His mom was right too, the level of freedom that Kyle now realized he had was really exciting. Perhaps too exciting, Kyle realized, as he heard and felt his newly enlarged package straining his pants due to his excitement. His new package also came with the added effect of being noticeably more difficult to ignore than it ever was before. Kyle had too actually put in a small amount of effort to keep himself from reaching down and touching it. His mom evidently noticed this as well, as she looked over at him beginning to blush and staring down at his own crotch. She sighed before saying, &quot;If you really want to you can go ahead and do it now, since you seem so incapable of controlling yourself right now. I&#39;m finished eating anyways.&quot; She then got up from the table and walked over to the sink to wash her plate. Kyle meanwhile was still holding back, still not really comfortable with jacking off in full view of his mother, even if he is allowed to. Unfortunately for him though, his boner disagreed, as it began to push harder. Willpower alone didn&#39;t work yet. He hadn&#39;t yet acclimated to having a cock this large. The breaking point was when he dropped the fork he had been holding directly onto his lap, and right onto his bulge. This small amount of stimulation was enough for him to almost entirely forget that his mom was still only a couple feet away. He undid his pants and pulled his cock out right there at the dining table, windows leading to the outside wide open, and his mom not even acknowledging his active masturbating. His hands flew up and down his beast of a phallus. He had so little experience with a penis this large, and had yet to develop a solid masturbating strategy. He had no rhythm when stroking, and most of his strokes weren&#39;t even able to go all the way up and down due to his habits he had formed over years of masturbating with something so much smaller. Eventually the pleasure was balanced out with the frustration of his incapability of masturbating effectively. He absent mindedly began to think how much easier this would be if somebody with more experience could help him. In his fog of horniness he scarcely even realized what he was about to say before it was too late.<br />
&quot;Damnit, I just want somebody to help with this.&quot; he said, briefly forgetting the power which had made him like this in the first place. As if a switch had been flipped his mom turned towards him, with a look in her eyes that he didn&#39;t recognize.<br />
&quot;Well why didn&#39;t you just say so?&quot; she says, in a slightly lower tone than he is used to hearing from her. She begins walking towards him, and his heart sinks as his brain catches up with the situation. Surprisingly quickly his mom makes her way over to him and sits down in the chair next to his.<br />
&quot;Wait no I-&quot; Kyle begins to say, before being cut off by the pleasure of a foreign hand being partially wrapped around his rigid appendage. A second later his mom&#39;s hand began to move up and down, at first somewhat strangely, but she quickly found her rhythm. Eventually she got to a point of jacking him off better than he could even do for himself. If Kyle was capable of thinking rationally in this moment he might have remembered the stories he&#39;d heard from his mom&#39;s friends about her adventurous days in college. How she was notorious for being a very promiscuous and experienced woman. Eventually after she turned 25 she began to slow down, and shortly afterwards got pregnant with Kyle. It would seem that none of that experience ever left her, as currently Kyle was experiencing more pleasure than he could rationally handle. He was nearly incapable of being consciously present in this moment, and as such couldn&#39;t tell his mom to stop. If this continued much longer Kyle wouldn&#39;t want to tell her to stop. What little willpower remained in Kyle was entirely spent on attempting to hold back the potential torrent of cum that would erupt, likely directly into the face of his own mother. All of this felt so good, but Kyle&#39;s rational mind knew that if that happened, he couldn&#39;t undo it. He would always have the memory of cumming on his mother&#39;s face. He was scared of the idea that he would regret that forever, or worse, that he might not, that something would snap in him and he would turn to liking it. He wasn&#39;t ready for that. <br />
Just as he began to get used to the constant downpour of pleasure on his mind, he heard his mom speak again. &quot;You know, for being so eager just a couple minutes ago, you sure are trying real hard not to finish.&quot; At first Kyle assumed she was talking to him, but based on where her gaze sat, she seemed almost as if she was talking directly to his dick. She began to speak again. &quot;Fine then. If you wanna play hardball, I&#39;ll just have to break out one of my old tricks.&quot; Before Kyle had time to respond, his mom readjusted her posture, and as if practiced a hundred times, she shoved nearly the entire length of his massive cock directly into her mouth. Kyle literally could not understand what had just happened. His mind wouldn&#39;t allow him to think, the pleasure was all too much. His vision blurred slightly from the pure pleasure of it all. His mom truly was an expert. She began bobbing up and down on his massive shaft, almost as if she simply did not have a gag reflex. With how long his cock now was, it was certainly going partially down her throat with each bob, not that you could tell from her actions. Kyle&#39;s vision began to unblur just in to to see his mom rest her lips all the way down on his pelvis. It truly didn&#39;t seem possible to him. The absurdity of this situation would overwhelm anyone in his position. The straw that broke the camels back was when she reached up slightly, and began to fondle his huge balls. Kyle couldn&#39;t hold on anymore, and could only hope that he could live with himself for what was about to occur. If he though the load he blew earlier this morning was large, than this orgasm would be classified as titanic. The sheer volume of cum that Kyle could feel emptying from his balls was mighty indeed. It went on for nearly a full minute, with an average orgasms worth of cum being launched out with each pump. Yet still the most impressive part of it all was the fact that nary a drop of it leaked out of his mothers mouth. She was managing to swallow it all. A true champion of fellatio. Eventually however the amount became too much for his mom&#39;s stomach to contain, especially after just having eaten breakfast, and she slid herself off his might rod. As a consequence, the last few pumps landed themselves squarely on her face and upper chest, though she didn&#39;t seem all that surprised, nor unwelcoming of it. She simply sat there and allowed it to happen until his orgasm subsided. By the end of it all she was left a mess, and Kyle was left completely spent, and with the worst case of post nut clarity, possibly ever. He mustered the energy to look at his mom, who merely smiled at him and said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the mess, you know I&#39;ll handle it.&quot; She then walked off to retrieve a towel, at no point bothering to wipe any of the still warm cum off of her face.<br />
While she was gone Kyle began thinking about what had just happened. Not only had his own mother just had oral sex with him, but it had  also been the best orgasm he&#39;d ever had. Kyle began to realize that he didn&#39;t entirely know what he was worried about. His mom wasn&#39;t angry. Both parties seem to have enjoyed themselves. Perhaps it was wrong to think this way, but that experience had been freeing for him. With his new power, it didn&#39;t matter what other people thought, he could do as he pleases. He still didn&#39;t want to become full on evil or anything, but what was the harm in a little fun like that if both parties are consenting adults. As Kyle was thinking about this he resolved to begin using his powers maybe a bit more liberally. Maybe stretch the limits of normalcy, and really see what he could do. He just had to decide where he wanted to start. After all, it&#39;s not like he could get much lower than sex with his mom, right? Kyle makes the decision...</p>
