<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike asked his person trainer to come over for a session. Mike knew dad liked her, he’d always stay and watch her for a while. His dad cleaned up the mess the house made. The trainer, Jane, who was about Dad’s age showed up in the evening. She came in her gym clothes and was expecting Mike to be to but Mike said he didn’t ask her to come for a session. He pointed backwards and she saw a giant crotch that she knew belonged to his dad. She looked up and saw his giant dads face smiling back. Mike explained about the remote and how it shrank him and how dad asked to grow huge. She still didn’t really understand but didn’t care. Mike and her walked up to his dad and they started climbing. His dad got hard at the idea that Jane was on his crotch. They both were sent upwards by his growing penis. His dad picked them both up in his hand and brought him closer to his face. Jane said hello and so did his dad and they both talked. His dad asked Jane if she liked his size. She said yes and that it turned her on. Mikes dad asked if she wanted to grow bigger too but she said she wanted him to grow bigger. Jane grabbed the remote from Mike and aimed it at his dad. <br />
<br />
She fired and nothing happened. But suddenly he started growing bigger. His hand expanded underneath them. He lowered his hand and he placed them on his crotch. He grew and grew so big that his feet were as big as skyscrapers. He kept growing and growing. His ass destroyed trees as it expanded. The lake near their home looked like a puddle to him. He stopped growing soon and now he was around 300ft tall. Jane still had the remote and fired at herself.<br />
<br />
She started growing huge, she dropped the remote and Mike sat and watched as she grew. She grew on his crotch and slowly she was the same size as it. She place Mike in her pants to keep him safe. In that process the remote shot again and she started growing faster. She climbed up on dads stomach, and grew. Her legs stretched back to his crotch and then the ground. She was the size of a baby to Mikes dad. She kept growing until she was finally his size. Mike was stuck in her back pocket but noticed a small hole he could climb out of. He grabbed her underwear and made his way forward. He made it to her crotch and climbed inside. <br />
<br />
Outside, Mikes dad grabbed Janes ass firmly and Jane touched his crotch. They both started making out. Mike could feel it and he decided to wait it out. Suddenly a giant hand pressed against Janes crotch and started rubbing it. Jane came and Mike was soaked. He climbed out of her crotch and pants. He fell in between both his dad and Janes crotch. He was pushed back and forth by them. Eventually, his dad reached down and picked him up. He placed him to the side. But then they rolled over and Mike was crushed by Janes ass. He couldn’t move and was stuck there. <br />
<br />
But this caused the remote to fire. Mike could feel Janes ass expanding again. Jane started growing again. Mikes dad didn’t notice but soon he was able to fit perfectly on her breasts. Jane sat up and Mikes dad fell on her crotch. She pulled mike out from under her ass. He was as small as her finger nail. They both were done for the night so Mike shrank Jane back to normal. His dad placed them on his crotch and Mike shrank him back too but not all the way. He was still huge. He also made Jane bigger, twice her height. Jane asked Mike if there was anything she could do to thank him and his dad for a fun time. Mike told her dad wouldn’t mind if she dated him and she said of course. Mike also asked if he could stay with her.<br />
<br />
Mike left with Jane and stayed at her house. His dad stayed there and the next day they went back.</p>
