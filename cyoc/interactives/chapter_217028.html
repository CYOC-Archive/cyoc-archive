<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Kevin and Kyle remained on the ground watching all the ATVs passing by, wheel by wheel. Kevin looked horrified and Kyle felt his heart racing and a knot in his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Kevin?&quot; Kyle asked, with a feeling much more intense than just the fear of being seen like this.<br />
<br />
Silence, no words, Kevin was in shock, standing still, staring firmly, a few low words came out of his mouth &quot;The necklace... the... necklace&quot;.<br />
And at that moment Kyle noticed that the necklace was no longer in their possession.<br />
<br />
&quot;The necklace?! Where is it? What happened?&quot; Kyle spoke rapidly, feeling afraid that something worse had happened.<br />
Kevin slowly looked down, looking at his body, slowly passing his hand over it. Perhaps Kevin was expecting something to happen to them both, but nothing seemed to be happening, they were still fused into one body. A body with two heads, an aberration. He thought in panic, which consumed his entire body. Kyle could feel the strong panic that ran through both their bodies, their hearts racing, sweating profusely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer me, Kevin, tell me, what&#39;s going on? You know that I feel everything you feel,&quot; Kyle said, trying to look at Kevin&#39;s face - &quot;Tell me, where is the necklace?&quot; Kyle spoke faster and louder, starting to get nervous. Kevin slowly raised his hand and pointed to the trail left by the ATV and whispered -&quot;It&#39;s gone&quot;.<br />
It was at that moment that Kyle began to understand what had happened, as he looked at the shattered necklace on the ground. There were dozens of small pieces, something that seemed impossible to mend. Kyle widened his eyes and looked at his own body and understood the panic that had run through his whole body. They had not separated, they were still a body with two heads, two people sharing the same body.<br />
Kyle felt fear, anger, he wanted to scream with all his might, wanted to fight as if Kevin were to blame, he did not want to assume that maybe they were trapped like this forever, but at this moment of panic, a sentence echoed loudly in his head &quot;as if you were made to be each other&#39;s second head...&quot; and the more Kyle felt scared, the more this sentence came to his mind and calmed him down, like a mantra.<br />
<br />
Kevin, on the other hand, was still absolutely in shock, he did not move his side of the body, just stared fixedly at this body &quot;an aberration&quot; was the word in his head, this body was only half of him, he would never be entirely himself again, he would always be Kyle&#39;s half, just a half.<br />
<br />
However, something inside him was calming his feelings, while Kyle was calming down, he was also bringing Kevin to a calm state, and this was slowly bringing him back to consciousness, coming out of shock little by little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Kevin whispered - &quot;why?&quot; his voice gradually increased until a scream came out of his mouth &quot;WHY ARE WE STILL TOGETHER?&quot; Kevin looked down and with a trembling voice began to apologize &quot;-this is all my fault, I&#39;m sorry Kyle, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
&quot;Kevin, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not angry, it&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Kyle spoke trying to calm Kevin&#39;s breathing and whole body, in a calm voice - &quot;We&#39;ll find a way...&quot;<br />
&quot;How? How will we find a way?&quot; Kevin interrupted Kyle - &quot;This necklace, this damn necklace, only with it we had a way to separate ourselves&quot; His voice remained trembling, like a cry &quot;How will we do it? How will we live our lives? How will we go out on the streets? We&#39;re an aberration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt a heartache at being called an aberration, but nonetheless, it was worth calming Kevin down, he knew everything would be okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll figure this out,&quot; said Kyle, trying to maintain a positive voice. &quot;Moreover, I think we&#39;ve now been able to free the others. Just think, Jack won&#39;t have to share his body anymore. He&#39;s free, like all the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin had a moment of calm as he remembered his brother. He was free, and that eased Kevin a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Furthermore,&quot; Kyle continued, &quot;you&#39;ll never have to share your body with Josh again. See? A great relief.&quot; Kyle said this in a playful manner, and it made Kevin let out a light, muffled laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say it as if only I benefit from not sharing my body with Josh again,&quot; Kevin replied in a low but slightly humorous tone, which made Kyle laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? We both agree that this is the best,&quot; they both laughed together, and Kyle smiled at Kevin, even though they couldn&#39;t see each other&#39;s faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I&#39;ll be happy to help you with Jack,&quot; Kyle reaffirmed.<br />
<br />
Gradually, Kevin began to calm down, and the word aberration began to fade from his mind. Something inside him made him feel very natural about sharing his body with Kyle, as if they had always been sharing their body between them.<br />
<br />
Both forced their bodies forward and walked towards the necklace, collecting piece by piece, storing each piece they found. Perhaps if they could glue the pieces together, everything would go back to normal, that&#39;s what they both had in mind.<br />
<br />
With each piece stored, they began to walk slowly back home along the path they came. Kevin was still downcast, feeling guilty about what had happened, and Kyle led the way with his head held high, with only one thought in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were made to be each other&#39;s second head.&quot;</p>
