<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up to Nancy shaking you and saying, &quot;Come on get up Lisa. There's a few things that you need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
You opened your eyes a bit and said, &quot;I had a weird dream that we ate people last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't a dream,&quot; Nancy said with a smile.<br />
<br />
You sat bolt upright and asked, &quot;It wasn't a dream?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Nancy said digging out some of her clothes and some of your's too. &quot;Like I told you last night they're alright though. In fact you'll see Caitlin when we go to the baths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I ate someone,&quot; you said placing your head into your hands.<br />
<br />
Nancy placed her clothes on her bed then came over and after putting your clothes on your bed grabbed your shoulders and said, &quot;It's alright Lisa. At least you didn't eat a non-shifter. Henry did that when he first shifted into a Naga. He's been torn up by it ever since. It's difficult to control the instincts of what you shift into the first time especially if you haven't learned to control your shifts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still ate someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she was alright after wasn't she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember what she said to you once she had become whole again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She said that it was an experience she wants to do again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Nancy said hugging you. &quot;Now stop beating yourself up over it and get your toiletries so we can go to the baths.&quot;<br />
<br />
You rolled out of bed and looked in your cases but you couldn't find your toiletries. Looking back up at Nancy you said, &quot;I can't find them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can borrow mine for this morning and then we can stop at the school store and get you some more,&quot; Nancy said going back over to her bed and picking up her clothes and toiletries.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't have any money,&quot; you said picking up your own clothes. You noticed that Nancy had taken out your favorite sundress for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry about it. You get an allowance of twenty bucks a week for doing a few chores around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What type of chores?&quot; you asked as you followed Nancy out of your room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh for you it will mostly be a little cleaning and helping to set the tables,&quot; Nancy said slithering into the common room. &quot;As you get older you'll be able to do more chores and have a bigger allowance. The store keeps a tab for each student. We need to stop there anyway after we get your student ID so you can get your uniform.&quot; By this time you were out of the common room and walking down a hall. &quot;Oh I almost forgot. Char came by to give you your keys.&quot;<br />
<br />
You took the keys from Nancy and asked, &quot;Which one is which?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The one with our house crest on it is the key to the common room while the other is for our room,&quot; Nancy said smiling. &quot;Ah here's the girl's baths,&quot; she said opening a door. You went down a short corridor to a desk by another door. &quot;Good morning Professor Helms,&quot; Nancy said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Miss Bones,&quot; Professor Helms said. &quot;Please show your ID.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Professor,&quot; Nancy said showing her a card. &quot;Oh this is Lisa Perkins. She doesn't have her school ID yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You attest that this is indeed Miss Perkins?&quot; Professor Helms asked giving Nancy and you a penetrating gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Nancy said with a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I need you to sign this form stating that,&quot; Professor Helms said after writing something down on a piece of paper and handing it to Nancy. After Nancy singed it and handed it back she said, &quot;You two may go in now. And Miss Perkins, I would suggest that you get your student ID today to avoid this in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Professor,&quot; you said with a little nod and followed Nancy into the baths.<br />
<br />
The baths weren't anything like you expected them to be. You had expected some showers and indeed there were showers along one wall but there were also five Olympic size pools in there. Two of them were giving off some steam and the majority of the girls were in one of those and some chatting away on the sides washing themselves. All of the girls were naked and you didn't think it was very hygienic. Nancy seemed to sense your confusion since she said, &quot;Don't worry about it. The baths are constantly filtered and sanitized. In the years since I've been here we've only gotten sick from the baths once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; you said nodding. &quot;How come there's someone at the door and you have to show your student ID?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well boys aren't allowed in here,&quot; Nancy said taking her nightgown off and putting it into a laundry bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why if we see each other nude in the halls?&quot; you asked looking at Nancy curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they feel that the opposite sex shouldn't see each other bathing,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;Don't ask me why they feel that way as I don't really know. Now put your clothes in a basket and take off your PJ's. You can put them in my laundry bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I'm comfortable being nude in front of everyone,&quot; you said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've changed in front of people before haven't you?&quot; Nancy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I have,&quot; you said blushing more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's no different now than it was then,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;But I can understand what you're feeling. I felt the same way when I first came here. Of course I really was a six year old girl at the time and the only one I had been nude in front of was my mother. You on the other hand were older when you first shifted and have been nude in front of other people before. Though I think I can understand why you feel the way you do. Your body was more developed and now it isn't. Don't worry so much about it. Your body will develop again.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had to admit that she had a point so still blushing you took off your PJ's and panties putting them in Nancy's laundry bag. &quot;Ok I'm sure that you need to use the toilets,&quot; she said smiling. &quot;Follow me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You followed her through a doorway and found what you expected the toilets to look like. Stalls on one end of the room and sinks on the other. Nancy stuck her tail in one of the stalls and you heard the tinkle of pee hitting water. You were a little astonished at this as you thought she would have had a hard time peeing. She was looking at you with a questioning look and you just shrugged your shoulders and went into a stall to pee. Once done you asked Nancy, &quot;Why did you only need to put your tail in the stall?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy smiled at you and said, &quot;Well I'm part snake and snakes have one hole near the tip of their tail for removal of waste. I bet you were expecting me to be peeing from about the same area as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was,&quot; you said blushing. &quot;Now lets go get cleaned up.&quot; You followed her back out to the baths as she said, &quot;Each bath is a different temperature. One is near freezing and another is near boiling. Then we have a cold one and a hot one then the warm one. Most of the girls like the hot one since it's pretty relaxing so we'll see if you like that one first. If it's too hot for you we'll go to the warm bath.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you approached the one with the most girls you saw a sign stating the temperature of the water. You carefully stepped into it and found that while it was hot it was nice. Kind of like a spa. You walked to the deeper water until it was up to your shoulders. Nancy was there with you and she helped you to wash your body and hair. During this Caitlin came over and you learned that Professor Helms was her mother and that both of them had been male before their first shift.<br />
<br />
Once you were clean the three of you got out and used the provided towels to wrap your hair and body. Nancy led you to another room where there were hair driers and she dried your hair while brushing it. Then it was back to the baths to put your clean clothes on and out the door for your little tour.<br />
<br />
Nancy dropped the laundry bag back in your room then took you to the administrative block. There Professor Manson took your photo and made your school ID. Before you left he said, &quot;Now don't lose that Miss Perkins. There are some here who can shift into a reasonable replica of anyone. If they get hold of your ID then they could cause some trouble for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll remember that Professor,&quot; you said smiling then following Nancy out.<br />
<br />
Nancy showed you the arts block, the maths block, the science block, the social and history block, the gym, the languages block, the shift block, the library, and finally the computer block. While at the computer block she took you to a room and said to the person inside, &quot;Scuse us Professor Hart. Lisa Perkins needs her laptop issued.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah of course,&quot; Professor Hart said with a smile. &quot;I just need to see your school ID Miss Perkins.&quot; After showing him your ID he went to a cabinet and pulled out a backpack. Handing it and a piece of paper to you he said, &quot;This contains all your school books. The paper contains your email address and password as well as log-in information for Netflix. Each student has the nine dollar subscription to Netflix. If you have any problems with the laptop just bring it back and we'll see what we can do to fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Professor,&quot; you said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think nothing of it,&quot; Professor Hart said waving it off. &quot;Now go on as I'm sure you have other things you'd like to do today.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next stop was the school store. It was a separate building and it had basically everything you would need. A girl who looked to be seventeen came up and said, &quot;Hi Nancy. Who do you have with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Lisa Perkins,&quot; Nancy said with a little wave toward you. &quot;Lisa, this is Heather Bond. She works here and it looks like she'll be helping with your uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me Lisa,&quot; Heather said holding out a hand which you took. She led you to a changing cubicle and asked, &quot;Do you know what size you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not really,&quot; you admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then I'll need you to strip so I can take your measurements,&quot; she said pulling out a cloth measuring tape. You decide to do as you're asked and soon you were standing there nude with her taking your measurements. After she said, &quot;Well you can get dressed again and if you need anything else go ahead and get it. The first three uniforms are provided for by the school though if you want extras you'll have to pay for them. Come up to the check-out when you're ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather left before you could say anything and sighing you got dressed. Once you were back out into the store you found toiletries for yourself and Nancy soon found you. You took what you had up to the check-out and Heather handed you three sets of clothes. Turns out that the uniform was black dress shoes, white pantyhose, dark blue skirt, white blouse, and dark blue vest with the school crest (a werewolf howling at the full moon) on the left and the house crest (a human shadow on a white background) on the right. You paid for the extra you bought on a tab the store keeps for students and you went outside with Nancy.<br />
<br />
Once outside Nancy asked you, &quot;So what do you want to do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is there to do?&quot; you asked shrugging your shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there's and aerial race today,&quot; Nancy said thinking. &quot;Then there's a boxing match, a cycle race, a shift-off, paintball, we could go swimming in the lake, read in the library, watch something, or just walk around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a shift-off?&quot; you asked intrigued by the sound of that.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's where two or more shifters shift as many times as they can before giving up or passing out,&quot; Nancy explained. &quot;The winner is the one who does the most shifts. It can get quite exciting watching as most of the participants have multiple forms they can shift into and they sometimes start shifting into another form before they're completely shifted. Of course everyone has a favorite and the houses tend to put their best shifters in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like it might be fun,&quot; you said thinking over your options.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;So what do you want to do?&quot;</p>
