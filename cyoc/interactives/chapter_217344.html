<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ugh,” the fat wizard growls as he runs to the bathroom. “Who do those bitches think they are?”<br />
<br />
The wizard is furious at the giggling girls for body shaming him. Why should people make fun of him just for his looks? They should at least judge him based on his personality. It didn’t help that he was bullied at high school for being overweight and having the reputation of the “weird kid.” Most of the students there had carelessly tossed him aside, and when he had to do something with them, they made him do most of, if not, all of the work for them. Wait, high school?<br />
<br />
“Hold up,” the wizard realizes, “I think I have an idea.”<br />
<br />
The wizard decides to magically spy on the girls. To do this, he aims his wand at the window and watches. Blue ashes spread around the mirror as the wizard’s reflection disappears. Before long, the mirror is now a magical TV. It will reveal all of the girls’ information about them. Combine all of that together, and that would result in the wizard’s own camera.<br />
<br />
“Perfect,” the wizard comments, “now which girl should I observe first?”<br />
<br />
It takes him a few seconds to decide for himself; ultimately, he chooses to look at April Austen first. He points his wand toward the mirror, and it then reveals April and her family. She has a height of 5’9” while her skin is sun-kissed. Her long hair is brown with some blonde highlights, and she likes to have it braided. Her body is curvy with b-cup breasts to go with it. She wears a pink cut off shirt to go with her jeans and girly pink shoes. April lives with her mom May along with her thirteen-year-old twin brothers Jason and Julius and ten-year-old Garrett, who is another brother. <br />
<br />
The wizard changes the camera to see Betty &#39;&#39;Bets&#39;&#39; Evergreen, whom her parents like to call Elizabeth. Unlike her friends, she is a part of the African American race with dark chocolate skin. Bets also has a height of 5 &#39;6&#39;&#39; and curly black hair with a fair number of blonde highlights. Her house is a suburban ranch that also accommodates her mother, a housewife in her forties with a traditional fashion sense, Sandra, her older sister who attends community college, her twelve-year-old brother Dustin, a new member in the football team, and five-year-old Kelly. Bets’s boobs are around a c-cup, leaving her with the biggest tits of the girls. To cover these, she wears a blue bra and a sea-foam colored t-shirt. She also has a pair of shorts and blue chacos to match them. <br />
<br />
Once the wizard is finished with Bets, he sets his camera to see Chastity Leland, who is the youngest member by a few months. Despite this, she has a height of 5’9”. Chastity has an athletic body type with a-cup breasts and short strawberry blonde hair. She likes to dress herself in a short sleeved orange flannel shirt over a white t-shirt while also wearing jeans and black tennis shoes. Coming from a Western European upper middle class, Chastity has family members who consist of her mother, her father, and her identical eleven-year-old triplets Lina, Nina, and Tina.<br />
<br />
Finally, the wizard sets his camera to Diane Malone, who has the body of a dancer with both brains and beauty. She has a height of around 5’6” while also having caramel skin, long black hair, and a b-cup bust. Diane likes to wear a plain white shirt along with a pair of jeans and a pair of black chacos. While she’s interested in health and fitness to maintain her figure, she sometimes gets herself into unhealthy foods. Her family members are Dr. Vern Malone, a dad who runs a clinic, her mom Eve, and her eleven-year-old twins Tina and Debbie.<br />
<br />
Before long, the camera shows all of the girls. Analyzing, the wizard soon concludes that all four of the girls are sixteen years old. They all like to hang out at the bus stop. This gives the wizard more confidence in his plan.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go disguise myself as a stud, become invisible to sneak to the school, and put a pink ring in the air once all of the girls show up,” the wizard monologues. “When one of them touches the ring, they’ll be into something that will change their lives forever.”<br />
<br />
Before the wizard truly goes on with his plan, he takes off his Saturday Morning cartoon character t-shirt, his suspenders, his pants, his Nikes, and finally his yellow boxers. This action leaves the wizard completely naked. Afterwards, he almost immediately wraps his body in blue mist as his reproductive system produces more testosterone. Starting with his height, the magic makes the wizard’s spine extend more and more until he is granted a height of being over six feet tall. Consequently, everything around the wizard seems smaller.<br />
<br />
‘Good,’ the wizard thought, ‘but this is just the beginning.’<br />
<br />
Next, the wizard’s gaze travels to both of his hands in time to see all of their chubbiness turn rough as his hands become large and blocky. It isn’t long before his biceps join the changes by embracing the growing muscle. The more muscle his arms receive, the more powerful his arms become. In addition, his shoulders broaden out to welcome his flawless form. Within seconds, both of his arms had become totally ripped!<br />
<br />
To make the face change next, the wizard facepalms, and blue magic spread all over it. His long, frizzy hair shrinks in length until it barely reaches his shoulders. The wizard’s jawline gets sharp while simultaneously letting his eyes become bold. In addition to this sexy development, a five o’clock shadow sprouts out. After that, his dull gray hair darkens along with the new stubble until his hair is completely jet black.<br />
<br />
With the wizard’s height, arms, and face out of the way, the magic slowly spreads down to the rest of his body. The wizard moans out loud, with it being a tenor at first but then slowly becoming more and more hypnotic as his neck thickens to make room for the growing Adam’s apple. At the end of the minute, the wizard’s voice is now at a commanding baritone. <br />
<br />
“I really like where this is going,” the wizard comments, “now to let it change the rest of my body.”<br />
<br />
As the magic continues to work its way downward, the wizard starts to feel a painful sensation in his moobs. Instead of watching them grow in size, he sees them receding back to his chest. Half a minute later, his chest is entirely flat. The wizard’s chest grows again, but now, those moobs are in the form of hard pectorals. While that happens, his stomach takes a painful sensation as if he got kicked by someone. It quickly shrinks back until there are no remnants of the bulging belly. In replacement, an amazing six pack forms.<br />
<br />
Before diving into the main course, the magic goes down to the wizard’s legs. He watches his chubby legs harden as all of its fat transforms into pure muscle. Meanwhile, his bum becomes tight and firm while letting the muscle get itself in it. At this point, there is only one thing left to take care of: the small penis. What was once considered a two-and-a-half-incher nearly quadruples in size as more veins wrap around it.<br />
<br />
“Perfect,” the wizard comments, “absolutely perfect. I already can’t wait to exploit this to the girls! Of course, this is only just phase one.”<br />
<br />
Thus, the wizard casts a spell to make him invisible, and in the next second, the new stud is nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I’ll give myself a nickname for the girls to call me,” the wizard says. “How about Rob?” <br />
<br />
The wizard thinks about it for a moment before he announces, “Yeah, I’ll go with it. Now for the pink ring.” <br />
<br />
He reaches into his pocket and successfully finds it.<br />
<br />
“Good, now for phase two,” Rob declares.<br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
“Hey, girls!” April joins along with Bets, Chastity, and Diane as they travel on the sidewalk after being dropped off by the bus.<br />
<br />
“Hello, April!” Diane addresses.<br />
<br />
“Do you think we should tell the class about that fat man we saw in the mall?” Bets asks.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Chastity answers, “I bet they’ll be making a joke about-”<br />
<br />
“Hey, girls,” April interrupts, “you got to take a look at something I found on a bush.”<br />
<br />
“What is it?” Chastity questions as she, Bets, and Diane go find the same bush as April. It is at that point that they see the ring.<br />
<br />
“Who is going to touch it?” Bets inquires.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Diane comments with suspicion, “it could be a trap.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, please,” Chastity answers, “what’s the worst that can happen?”<br />
<br />
“So is one of us going to get the ring, or are we all just going to go to class?” April wonders.</p>
