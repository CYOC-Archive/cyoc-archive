<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John pushed Scott’s phone away from his face as Scott giggled maniacally, the two of them wrestling each other on the bed. “S-stop showing me that, I-I don&#39;t take responsibility for this!...” John protested in embarrassment, face flush, rolling over on top of Scott. Scott laid in place temporarily, letting the video of the night before continue to play. Even if John didn’t want to see the video, he could still hear the audio. John would get embarrassed one way or another.<br />
<br />
“But I do know it still is you, to some extent, right honey?” Scott caressed John’s cheek, smiling brightly. “A part of that night is still in you, waiting to come out… you could make it come out right now, can’t you?” Scott was right, in a weird way. Ruby stuck to John’s mind tangibly, changing the way the man thought, what the man liked, how the man felt…<br />
<br />
“I’d rather not, Scotty… we can do the method acting in costumes, I don’t feel like leveraging my scattered mind to help you get off.  Right now, anyway.” John sighed, rolling off the top of his friend and laying down side by side. The two of them had a wild night yesterday. They both enjoyed it. They would like to do it again sometime, too. But they’ve got work tomorrow.<br />
<br />
“You ever feel like leaving it all behind, Scott?” The sunlight pushed through the curtains, illuminating the room softly as the two of them gazed off into the ceiling. “We could make it happen, I think. One week with the costumes, and we could probably pull together enough magical knowledge to not have to work ever again.”<br />
<br />
“Retiring isn’t the same as leaving it all behind, though, Ruby. Leaving it behind is… grand. &#39;Another life&#39; kind of grand. Retiring is just… us, still being us, together, but able to enjoy life in a carefree fashion. Able to choose what we want to do, without pressure from the outside world.” Scott scratched his neck, voice taking on a more tired tone. “I think we could retire if we sold copies of the videos I recorded.&quot; <br />
<br />
Scott felt arms press down on his chest as John rolled on top of him. John smiled through his teeth, as menacing a smile as he could muster, and leaned his forehead against Scott’s. “You post even a frame of that video ANYWHERE, or much less THINK about posting that video somewhere, and I’ll put you in that collar for a MONTH, and YOU&#39;LL be the one sucking my feet everywhere I go, you got that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott awkwardly shifted his legs as he tried not to show how hot he found this. T-though… maybe he could show it. Maybe they could take another step forward. All he needed to do was… g-gosh... <br />
<br />
“H-how about a… a kiss… J-John?...” Scott’s voice got softer and softer, looking needily at John. <br />
<br />
John was blindsided by the sudden change in tone, but he realized how much he must&#39;ve been turning Scott on. “Ah… you’re a boykisser, aren’t you, Scotty? You like kissing boys…” John didn’t give Scott a chance to respond, kissing him on the lips. Their hearts skipped a beat as they nuzzled into each other, just giggling to themselves like giddy schoolgirls.<br />
<br />
“That… came out of nowhere, Scott… how’d this come about? You been thinking dirty thoughts about me behind my back this whole time, hmm?”<br />
<br />
“No, hah, it’s just… y-yeah… I think I want to put some of this life behind. Be with you. Have the costumes be our secret, for now, and just… enjoy them… I brought a little trinket with me, actually.” Scott said, lightly shoving John away before reaching for a cabinet, pulling a shelf open to grab a collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, shit, you&#39;re right, we could totally grab those costumes home, why the fuck do we keep them in the storage unit?&quot; John said, grabbing the collar and running his fingers through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Habit, I guess. Or the desire not to make wearing costumes a habit. If we could wear any costume, any time, we&#39;d probably never stop putting all sorts of costumes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a bad thing? We both kinda want to… let go of our responsibilities. I don&#39;t want to be managing sales for the next decade.&quot; John put the collar down on the bed, sighing pensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it&#39;s not a bad thing, no. What did you want to try, then? Different job, different body, different species, different socioeconomic status, different role in society… What&#39;s your poison, John?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;T-that&#39;s hard. If I could be anything, choosing something would make me feel like I&#39;m missing out on everything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, with any luck your Uncle probably has a youth spell lying around somewhere, so we have a massive amount of time to try out everything. Besides, it&#39;s not like Uncle has infinite costumes.&quot; Scott held John&#39;s hand, smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of us could put on his robe for a while and make new costumes or something. Pretty much infinite costumes. Not sure if I could put up with you for a &quot;massive amount of time&quot;, though.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, but you love me, don&#39;t you, Ruby?&quot; Scott bumped into John with his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I think so.&quot; The two of them continued to lie in bed, staring at the ceiling and occasionally stealing glances at one another as they held hands. <br />
<br />
A few minutes had passed. John&#39;s other hand was twiddling with the collar, something on his mind as he gave the idea of leaving his old life behind more thought. It… it might not be fair to the people who know him. But parts of this life made him uncomfortable. If something is making you uncomfortable, you have the right to cut that thing out of your life.<br />
<br />
  - What&#39;s the point of hopping between lives? Just to run, and avoid the pains and consequences of life, or to find a refuge in the shelter of new flesh? - a thought surfaced in his mind, spoken by himself but as if thought by someone else.<br />
<br />
  - Probably to find a life we enjoy, honestly. Or, if that doesn&#39;t work out, just think of it as an extended vacation. I&#39;m overdue for one. - John responded, casually.<br />
<br />
  - What about Scott? Does he want to leave it behind, too, or is he just afraid of losing you without knowing where you&#39;ve gone or what you&#39;ve become? - <br />
<br />
  - That… that&#39;s a sad question. Stop asking sad questions. -<br />
<br />
  - Just trying to help us rationalize this. We agree that our life is kind of shit, but… this is Scott&#39;s decision, too, and you have to involve him in this. He will follow you no matter what, but it&#39;d be right to make sure that what happens is right by him, too. - <br />
<br />
  - I agree, but didn&#39;t Scott already-. -<br />
<br />
<br />
John was taken out of his thoughts by a hand reaching down into his underwear. He quickly rolled away from Scott, punching him lightly in the chest. &quot;What the fuck, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were taking too long, I had to take you out of there.&quot; Scott said with an innocent, timid tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck do you mean I was taking too long? I stop paying attention to you for like a minute, and you already get so attention starved that you NEED to touch my cock? It&#39;s not like we&#39;ve got work today…&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them laid in awkward silence for a couple dozen seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry, didn&#39;t realize it&#39;d bug you that much…&quot; Scott whispered, pulling more of the blanket on himself. &quot;I-is there anything I could do to apologize…&quot;<br />
<br />
John sighed. This was a sex thing. He was broken out of a socratic dialogue by a horny roommate. Who he has a blossoming romance with. &quot;You&#39;re making it very tempting to put the collar on you, Scott,&quot; John said with a hint of frustration in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;d hate that so very much, not the collar… that&#39;d be so embarrassing…&quot; Scott replied with false drama in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I genuinely can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m winning or losing if I put the collar on you. On one hand, I dominate you and get you to stay silent for a while. On the other hand, that&#39;s exactly what you want.&quot; John sighed. &quot;C-can we just talk about something for a moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Scott raised an eyebrow, crossing his arms as he looked at John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really want to try to find a new life for the two of us? I… I get the impression that you&#39;d follow me no matter what you actually thought about abandoning everything behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room was silent for a minute as Scott pondered the question. Two minutes. Three. Scott was taken out of his own deliberation by John rubbing Scott&#39;s crotch who started stammering. Tit for tat.<br />
<br />
John pulled away now that he had Scott&#39;s attention. &quot;That&#39;s what I mean. For you, it&#39;s not as obvious as it is for me. For me-.&quot; John was interrupted by Scott putting a finger to his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, it&#39;s obvious to me. If these costumes are a shortcut to a happy life, I&#39;m taking it. I&#39;ve had enough of working in a stupid fucking office. This is a gift to us, not some sort of moral quandary. And I&#39;m more than happy to share that gift with you.&quot; Scott sighed, leaning over and kissing John on the cheek. &quot;John, we could be rich, we could be healthy forever, and we could have the best sex of our lives whenever we want it. That&#39;s like, the ideal male fantasy. One - own real estate. Two - have a lot of sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
John was relieved. They felt the same way. A tear slid down his cheek, heart burning with love for the man in front of him. The two of them laid for another minute or two, just enjoying each other&#39;s presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were more of a &quot;retire by selling porn of my boyfriend&quot; kind of guy, not &quot;leave everything behind&quot; kind of guy, didn&#39;t you say something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my everything right now, dork.&quot; Scott kissed John on the lips before resting his head on John&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
  - He&#39;s SOO cheesy. -<br />
  - Yeah, but he&#39;s so adorable for it . -<br />
  - Shush, we&#39;re still talking to him. -<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we having sex or what, John? I brought the collar for a reason, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, you&#39;re so needy. You don&#39;t even want to have sex like a normal person anymore, it needs to be this bondage-pet play thing?&quot; John said, putting his arms under Scott&#39;s shoulders and idly scritching his boyfriend&#39;s chest with one of his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to be kinkshamed by a guy who sucked my toes yesterday. For an hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was actually kind of upsetting to John. A weird after-effect of wearing the collar and developing Ruby&#39;s personality is that he&#39;s… uhh… t-tolerant of feet, now. It wasn&#39;t his decision to develop the fetish though. And Scott knew this, apparently trying to get another rise out of John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aight, I&#39;ve heard enough, you&#39;re going to horny jail.&quot; John took the collar and snapped it onto Scott&#39;s neck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ruby&#39;s mind rapidly reconfigured itself as the clicking noise dug into his subconscious, thoughts of serving Master, worshiping Master, washing Master, sucking Master, all blossomed within him and came to the forefront of his identity. He felt like he was in the wrong body, though. He was a kobold, he remembered his whole life as a kobold, and yet… here he was, in human flesh. The sensitive skin, the softness and fragility of fatty flesh… perhaps this was a good thing, for it allowed him to feel Master&#39;s touch even better, to better focus on it given the absence of a proper sense of smell to distract him.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, this is kinda hard without a robe… I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing… uh, pet, what&#39;s your name?&quot; John said hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ruby, my Master.&quot; Ruby said with no hesitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh… o-okay, I think I get it. The collar still has all the same magic, one that I probably can&#39;t remove without a wand…&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
John had to try to get into character. That was kind of easy actually, all he had to do was let loose a little and slip into-.<br />
<br />
John took a look at the boyfriend next to him. He was under a whole set of enchantments, huh? Well, if he can&#39;t remove them directly, he could still tap into the collar&#39;s inherent magic and try to get Scott to obey the commands.<br />
<br />
- I&#39;m so fucking good. - John contently said in his head, lightly piloting the body as he let another part of himself dictate his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forget your life as Ruby. You&#39;re not a kobold, you were never a kobold. You were always a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ruby blanked out. It was like his whole brain was being reformatted, practically all memories were vanishing one by one. After half a minute, he didn&#39;t know who he was, or why he was in bed with… Master. Huh, he remembered that this man was his Master.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember life as Scott. Scott is my delightful, submissive husband, and I&#39;ve known him since basically my childhood.&quot; <br />
<br />
Memories flowed into Scott&#39;s mind. As more of them surfaced, he recognized these as all the memories of his life with John that were suppressed by the collar. He remembered his job, his childhood… No memories were ever lost. Yet, looking back on them, there&#39;s something… odd. They were flirting like it was the very beginning of their romance mere minutes ago, but the two of them were husbands for years. That thought was quickly suppressed as the memory changed to suit Scott&#39;s new idea of reality.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to wonder if all the enchantments remain. Darling, PRESENT.&quot; Scott heard his husband say as the last word rang in his ears. Tossing the blanket from the bed, he stood up, then dropped to lean on his arms crossed under his neck, back curving as his two legs remained upright, keeping his butt up in the air. The movement was rehearsed, he was ready to present his butt to daddy at any moment. He was wearing only boxers, his erect shaft making his bulge look pretty appetizing as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold it like that, puppy. I need to take some pictures.&quot; Making sure the sound was on, John took his little revenge on Scott, photographing his husband from all angles.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I want to get this on video, too.&quot; Putting the camera on the side, giving a full view of the curve and the erect shaft, he pulled down Scott&#39;s underwear. Guy was small, actually. This dick was like, two and a half inches. Poor guy. John gave Scott&#39;s butt a big slap before preparing another one.<br />
<br />
Scott immediately bust, his shaft staining the bed with white batter. He didn&#39;t understand why. The moment he felt the slap, his whole being HAD to come. It felt fucking incredible, and he REALLY wanted to be spanked by daddy now that his ass was revealed to be a &quot;cum instantly&quot; button. He held the pose despite his body beginning to ache.<br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t actually want to have sex right now, but this was fun. Giving another slap, he ordered Scott to relax: &quot;You can stop presenting. Go shower yourself off and get some new clothes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The room smelled strongly of men. Scott didn&#39;t want to have to wash the sheets, so it&#39;s imperative that the two of them get the suits home. They could use some magic to clean off this mess.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the drive over to the unit, John removed the collar from Scott. Scott blushed and stuttered as his memories got filtered through his normal personality. John teased Scott with the video as the two of them got to the storage unit.<br />
<br />
The two of them extracted the suits, bringing them back home. Spreading them out across their living room, the two of them pondered what they wanted to try.</p>
