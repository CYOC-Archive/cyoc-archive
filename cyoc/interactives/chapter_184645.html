<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The more I thought about it, the more compelling the idea seemed.<br />
The pack of pills had a perverse and devilish attraction and by squeezing, I pulled out pill 3.<br />
I put the pack down and looked at the pill. It seemed inert, but I was fascinated by its magical power, and then, unable to resist, I put it in my mouth and swallowed it.<br />
I immediately felt sleepy and getting comfortable under my blankets, I fell asleep.<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
While Jon slept, the magic impregnating the fabric of his new pajamas activated.<br />
The label on his pajamas said 7 years old and Jon immediately started rejuvenating.<br />
He began to lose height and the few hairs that appeared with puberty were reabsorbed. The teenage muscle mass, the Adam&#39;s apple on his neck, dissolved leaving a prepubescent eleven-year-old in his bed.<br />
Rejuvenation resumed, and along with height and body mass the most noticeable changes occurred in his mouth, where many of his adult teeth fell out of his gums, largely replaced by baby teeth.<br />
When the transformation ended, in bed under the covers, he was sleeping, dressed in his Spider-man pajamas, a cute seven-year-old boy.<br />
The magic pajamas felt that the little boy was wearing the Pampers under his pajama bottoms and that even though the diaper was completely dry and clean, the little boy had pill 3 in his stomach.<br />
The magic pajamas also found that there was no writing on the front of the diaper, so it chose independently. For a short time, less than a second on the Pampers front, an inscription appeared, before evaporating. The writing indicated that Jon would start waking up dry again some mornings, only after his 32th birthday.<br />
The magic also spread around Jon. His bed blankets became cartoon-themed, and beneath Jon a rubber sheet forms quickly, and a bed-wetting mat to pick up any leaks. <br />
A magical cloud drifted away from Jon&#39;s bed and settled on the dresser.<br />
An open pack of Pampers, size 7, identical to the one Jon wore, appeared above Jon&#39;s dresser, and inside, all of his clothes, with the exception of his briefs, were transformed into clothes suitable for a 7 year old boy, very colorful and with cartoons or comics prints and embroideries on them.<br />
The Magic Pajamas had established that this little boy would, until at least his sixteenth birthday, only use diapers, so he made his old teenage underpants vanish into thin air.<br />
The cloud wrapped itself around his trash can, which it turned into a diaper pail and filled with diapers, most soaked and also some with poop. The diaper pail made his entire room smell faintly of pee and poop. <br />
On his desk, his old high school books become comics and textbooks and coloring books for the first grade.<br />
a large colored box appeared, with &quot;Jon&#39;s Toys&quot; written on the lid.<br />
<br />
The cloud returned to Jon&#39;s bed and on the nightstand he turned his bedroom light into a children&#39;s night light and turned it on.<br />
Under Jon&#39;s arm, the cloud crept in and when it dissolved, it had left behind a teddy bear.<br />
The magical pajamas made the child fearful of the dark and thunderstorms.<br />
<br />
The most important change was still on the way. The magic pajamas shrunk Jon&#39;s bladder and weakened the muscles that control his bladder and bowels.<br />
He also looked at the part of his brain that told him &quot;go to the bathroom now!&quot; making it developed like that of a toddler two year old.<br />
The magical pajamas felt Jon relax and then let out a sigh as he poured the entire contents of his shrunken bladder into the padding of the Pampers.<br />
The little boy rolls in bed, in his soggy diaper, and when he was on his stomach, his body pushed a large smelly load into the space between the back of the Pampers and his buttocks, causing the diaper bulge under his pj pants to expand. <br />
After finishing the preliminary transformations and gathering all the information, the pajamas released a shimmering magical cloud from its fabric that spread throughout the room, then throughout the house, going to his city and spreading around the world.<br />
Jon had become a diapered seven-year-old boy for everyone and reality had changed.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
While I slept, I dreamed I was sitting in a high chair at the table, in front of my parents and Matt, who had grown much older than me, and everyone seemed to know that I was still the teenage Jon who had become a toddler and they were making fun of me , while my mom was feeding me.<br />
I tried to eat alone, but I couldn&#39;t even hold the spoon and I spilled the food on my bib.<br />
After I had eaten my mother took me out of the high chair and took me to the changing table where she changed my diaper, in front of my brother who told me &quot;Does my big brother need to change his didee?&quot;<br />
I tried to cover myself and moved on the changing table, until, on the edge, I fell.<br />
Dreaming of falling to the ground, I suddenly woke up.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I was still in bed.<br />
I was not falling.<br />
Daylight was lightly illuminating my room, and a pleasant warmth was spreading to my crotch.<br />
Warmth in the crotch?<br />
I woke up completely and from being stretched out on my stomach, I jumped on all fours on the bed.<br />
I immediately felt that my diaper was soaked and swollen.<br />
I also felt that my room smelled like poop. I got up on my knees on the bed and looking at the padding of the front of my pajama bottoms caused by the soggy Pampers, with my right hand I felt my diapered bottom.<br />
I got immediate confirmation.<br />
I had shit on myself while I was sleeping.<br />
The pajama bottoms, however, were dry and clean.<br />
I got out of bed and felt the weight of my full diaper on my hips.<br />
The bed was bigger, the room seemed bigger to me.<br />
I got to the mirror and saw that a little boy was looking at me. I was that child.<br />
I was delighted.<br />
<br />
I walked around my room, now suited to my new age, and found it magnificent.<br />
To have the final confirmation, I had to go to someone in my family and see if it was normal for them to see me as a seven y/o boy diapered, or not.<br />
I was a little scared and embarrassed to go to my mom or dad or brother with a diaper full of poop in my pants.<br />
I also thought that in any case, this was my new reality, and that I would have to face it.<br />
I left the room and went down go the kitchen, where I could hear noises.<br />
There was my mom who was preparing the dough for the pancakes.<br />
When I walked into the kitchen, she saw me and greeted me “Hello sleepyhead. Did the scent of pancakes wake you up? &quot;<br />
She, now, was so much taller than me, and I approached, first slowly, then, I saw her eyes and couldn&#39;t resist. I ran the last few steps and hugged her legs.<br />
&quot;Mummy&quot; I managed to say, before starting to cry.<br />
Mom hugged me in turn, and began to caress me on the shoulders and head.<br />
“Jon… What&#39;s going on? Why are you crying ?&quot;<br />
Exact. Why I have a lump in one&#39;s throat and tears had filled my eyes ?<br />
The only answer was to hug her, while she bent down to have me at her face level.<br />
Dad also came into the kitchen, and looking at me hugging my crying mom, he asked her &quot;What happened to Jon? He&#39;s not fine ?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think he had a bad dream ...&quot;<br />
I nodded. “Nobody… nobody that loved me. I was alone and everyone was scolding me and I ... I couldn&#39;t even cry ... &quot; <br />
“Jon… It was just a bad dream. We all love you, and you know that if we scold you it&#39;s just to prevent you from hurting yourself or getting into trouble. &quot; Dad said.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let&#39;s go to the bathroom so I can change your wetty diaper. And then we have breakfast and you will see that your bad dream will disappear completely &quot;<br />
I nodded and followed her to the back bathroom of the house.<br />
I felt embarrassed when my mom quietly told my dad that I needed a diaper change.<br />
But it was proof that for her and for everyone it was normal.<br />
He took off my pajama pants and made me lie down on a surface, positioned above the washing machine and dryer, which acted as a changing table suitable for a seven-year-old child. At that point, she took off my dirty and soggy diaper, and after cleaning me up, she put me into another Pampers.<br />
It amazed me that she didn&#39;t even ask me if I should pee or poop on the toilet. It was perfectly normal for her that I peed and shit only into my diapers.</p>
