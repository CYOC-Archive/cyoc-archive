<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I decided that I should get to work, I don’t want to mess something up. <br />
<br />
Returning to the bathroom I rinsed off my new face and mentally prepared myself. I glanced into the mirror, looking my temporary self in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“Alright Amanda, you’ve got this. You clearly have some memories left over from the other you so maybe I can coast through the day without getting found out.”<br />
<br />
With that short pep talk I straightened myself up and returned to the closet to get my work outfit ready. I had already thrown on a sweater, a dark green turtleneck that hugged my new chest tightly. My nipples poking into the fabric, reminding me that I desperately needed a bra to contain my new body; along with the pants I would need. <br />
<br />
I grasped the waist of my pajama pants and stretched them down and around my now prominent hips. Bending over I was reminded even more that I was no longer a man, as my unsecured breasts dropped into my field of view. <br />
<br />
“Damn things.”<br />
<br />
I could only see the edges of my pale outer thighs past the obstacle that was my chest. From what I could tell Amanda was still in great shape, only a few stretch marks ran along the exposed flesh. She really wasn’t that bad looking, I’m sure if I was still my old self I would have been very interested in this view. As it stood now, I was just looking at a woman’s body. My own body. <br />
<br />
While absentmindedly considering my looks I peeled the turtleneck back off my torso. My new breasts free for just a moment as I dug through the closet.<br />
<br />
While digging I was reminded of my body’s other needs; namely my need to use the bathroom. Giving a long sigh I grabbed a bra and trudged back to the bathroom. All of this back and forth was taking forever, Johnathan would be pissed I was taking so long. I’d need to be extra convincing at our “lunch” meeting. <br />
<br />
Shuddering I sat on the toilet, my thighs spreading well beyond the seat. I wondered what kind of lunch meeting I was remembering. All I knew was that someone named Johnathan would be meeting me later for a supposed “lunch” meeting. But I couldn’t recall any of the details. I could only tell you that there would be very little actual food involved.<br />
<br />
Finishing my business and slipping the cups of the bra over my chest, I stood and wiped myself. I’ll be glad to be out of this body at the end of the day.  Walking to the closest for the last time, I slipped the turtleneck back over my body and collected a pair of black jeans. Locating a pair of panties in my drawer I stepped into them and slid them up my legs, stretching them over my butt. The pants were quick to follow until the waistband got caught on the widest part of my hips. Pulling up and jumping up and down eventually coaxed my body inside of the pants.<br />
<br />
It’s lucky I don’t have anything else to fit inside these pants, as the zipper was flush to my now flat crotch. Before heading downstairs and to work, I slipped on some no-show socks and half inch heels that matched my pants. Clopping down the stairs I glanced around my new apartment, unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to explore the space.<br />
<br />
“Come on Amanda, let’s just get to work. I can explore later.”<br />
<br />
Driving to work was largely uneventful, the only highlight was my surprise at the ease of navigation. Even though I had never seen this town before I was able to locate my workplace and get a decent parking space; especially considering my tardiness. <br />
<br />
Walking into the law office I was extremely aware of the way my new body moved, I walked with an exaggerated sway. My hips moving in a pattern I’d never be able to replicate as a man. My heels enforcing the exaggerated motion even further. Clutching the door to the office space with my small hand made me wonder how I was going to make it through the day. I had no idea what I was doing.<br />
<br />
Pulling open the door revealed a quiet and cozy waiting area, with my desk sitting in a corner overlooking the space. There was only one client in the room who immediately met my eyes for only a moment. His eyes slowly flowing down my face and to my chest. Lingering on my chest for a moment, he exhaled slowly and glanced further down my body at my hips.<br />
<br />
I cleared my throat and jerked him out of his lustful adventure.<br />
<br />
“Are you here to see Johnathan or Roy?” I asked.<br />
<br />
He fumbled over his words. “Er, uhmmm, ah, John I believe.”<br />
<br />
It would have been cute if he wasn’t balding and 50 pounds overweight. Why does Johnathan only work with sad losers? I’d kill to see some more hotties. God this place is so boring. At least work is stupidly easy, I know John only keeps me around for my body. But would it kill him to give me more work than the rare phone call?<br />
<br />
The loser entered John’s office, leaving me to the quiet waiting room.<br />
<br />
After about an hour or two of silence, only broken by a client from Roy calling and canceling the morning’s meeting. The loser and John exited his office with a grim look. <br />
<br />
“I’ll see you next week in court, maybe we can keep it to only 15 years.” John said solemnly.<br />
<br />
“Maybe.” The man said dejectedly as he walked out of our building.<br />
<br />
Immediately upon the loser’s departure John perked up and motioned me inside his office for our “lunch” meeting.<br />
<br />
“Sorry I was late boss.” I mentioned as he reached over me and shut the door. I hadn’t realized how much taller he was than me, I must be so much shorter now. Maybe only 5’2”  the heels hardly made a difference. The difference was luckily removed once he sat back and reclined in his chair. <br />
<br />
“That’s alright Amanda, as long as you don’t miss our ‘lunch’ meeting I won’t bother writing you up.” John said while reaching down and unbuckling his belt.<br />
<br />
Immediately it clicked. I knew what my lunch meeting was. I knew why Amanda wanted out of her life. Why I was now in her place. <br />
<br />
At least John wasn’t unattractive, his jaw was square and he had a full head of hair. Unlike his poor morning company. I let my eyes trace down from John’s face to his broad chest. I approached his chair and looked down at his strong arms, I could imagine him holding me close in a warm embrace. Unfortunately I knew this was only my imagination as he was only using me for my body. He didn’t really care what I wanted. As I let my eyes roam his body I found myself on my knees before his chair, the hight difference returning.<br />
<br />
Scooting myself between John’s legs I looked up into his anticipating eyes. Slowly I reached towards the button on his pants, my dainty hand shaking until it was met with sudden force.<br />
<br />
“Hold on, aren’t you forgetting something?” John motioned to my top.<br />
<br />
Sighing I had forgotten to expose my tits. Slowly without putting on a show I once more removed my top and bra, my breasts heaving under their own weight. My shoulders sagged and I already missed the bras support. <br />
<br />
The cold of the room caused me to shiver and my nipples to harden. To this John smiled and pulled his chair closer to my face. His pants in my face I could smell the laundry detergent that his wife used. It always smelled too strongly I thought as I unbuttoned his pants. Slowly I unzipped them and pulled down the waistband of his underwear.<br />
<br />
God he was massive, it had to be as long as my forearm. I had no idea how Amanda had done it so many years. Ignoring these thoughts I brought my lips to the base of his member and kissed. Slowly sliding my tongue up his shaft to the tip. Where I parted my lips and swallowed his cock.<br />
<br />
John Moaned “you’ve gotten better.”<br />
<br />
I tried to look up into his eyes, he was staring at the ceiling. It felt good to make him moan. I slowly lowered my mouth down his shaft, taking more and more into myself. Every moment I thought I would gag and give up. But I was a pro. I soon found my nose pressed into his sculpted bush. I am good at this.<br />
<br />
John moaned again “keep going!”<br />
<br />
I began to bob up and down, John’s moans encouraging me to work my tongue around the head while continuing to bounce. I liked being good at this.<br />
<br />
As quickly as it started John was finished, orgasming hard in my mouth. I was enjoying myself so much that I wasn’t ready, coughing and spitting up his cum onto my pants.<br />
<br />
“Damn, that was fantastic Amanda. Go home and clean yourself up. Same time tomorrow.” He laughed.<br />
<br />
Forgoing my bra I slipped my shirt back over my body and carried myself out of the building. Thoughts swirling through my mind at a million miles per hour. I hated this, but I also liked it. I hate that I like it. I drove back to my apartment as quickly as possible, trying desperately to ignore the warmth that spread through my crotch. <br />
<br />
Arriving back at Amanda’s apartment I had much more time to think. Peeling off my now stained pants and tossing them into the washing machine I looked up and saw that it was only 1pm. My panties pressed against my still warm vagina. The feelings from my time with Johnathan flooding back. I needed a shower, nap, and a drink. But most of all I needed out of this life.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the laundry room I decided that I should…</p>
