<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff found it very comfortable being a mannequin. He didn&#39;t feel any fatigue from standing motionless all day. It was after all what a mannequin was built to do.<br />
<br />
When the day was over, they took Jeff the mannequin down and stripped him. They dyed his hair blue and styled it in a fabulous gay hairstyle. Someone even painted blue pubes on him. Then they left him in storage again for the night.<br />
<br />
When he was sure he was alone, Jeff turned human and walked over to a mirror to check out his new hair. His pubes were bright blue as well. Jeff wondered how he was going to explain this to his parents.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a flashlight lit up pointing straight at Jeff. Jeff turned to see a security guard with a name-tag that read Jason standing and staring at him. Jeff turned back into a mannequin.<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;It&#39;s too late for that. I wasn&#39;t sure about what I saw last night on the video but I&#39;m sure now.&quot; Jason picked Jeff up an put Jeff&#39;s back in the corner. Jason&#39;s right hand caressed Jeff&#39;s butt while Jason&#39;s left hand held Jeff&#39;s bulge. &quot;You can change between being a mannequin and being a human. It&#39;s just like that movie and only I can see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff turned human and tried to push Jason away but Jeff was backed into a corner and Jason got a firm but not painful grip on Jeff&#39;s balls. &quot;No sir, don&#39;t touch me. I&#39;m not gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason kept his firm grip on Jeff&#39;s balls and ass. &quot;You&#39;re not my dream come true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir. I need your help. They threw my clothes away and I need to go home. My parents are probably worried about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason thought for a minute but didn&#39;t let go. &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll help you but it&#39;s easier to sneak a mannequin out of here than a naked human. I&#39;m the only one that ever watches the security videos. Turn into a mannequin again and I&#39;ll put you in my car. After my shift ends, we&#39;ll figure out the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason laid the passenger seat back in his car and squeezed Jeff the mannequin in. It was a tight fit and Jeff&#39;s butt did not touch the seat but Jeff was comfortable. He didn&#39;t know where he was and so sticking with Jason&#39;s plan seemed like his best bet.<br />
<br />
Finally Jason came out and drove the car. When they were a distance from the store, Jeff turned human again but Jason said, &quot;No, stay a mannequin. Do you want the cops to see?&quot; So Jeff stretched out into a standing mannequin again.<br />
<br />
Jason took Jeff home to his apartment. On the way up the stairs, they ran into Miss Marple, the mean old landlady.<br />
<br />
Miss Marple said, &quot;You&#39;re not bringing home strange men are you? You know what your lease says.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;No, Miss Marple. This is a mannequin.&quot; Then under his breath Jason added, &quot;You dumb hag.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they passed, Miss Marple said, &quot;I&#39;ve got my eye on you Jason. Don&#39;t think that you can get away with anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Yes, Miss Marple.&quot;<br />
<br />
When they were out of Miss Marple&#39;s earshot, Jason told Jeff, &quot;She assumes that because I&#39;m gay, I must associate with creeps.&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire time Jason carried Jeff, Jason had a hand on Jeff&#39;s bulge. It felt good but Jeff had to justify it as the best way to carry a mannequin because his daddy always told him this was wrong.<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s apartment was a studio apartment. There wasn&#39;t even a wall between the toilet and the rest of the apartment. It was all just one giant room.<br />
<br />
Jason set Jeff down and asked, &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I&#39;m famished. I haven&#39;t eaten in more than twenty four hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Good, I&#39;ll whip us up some hamburgers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff covered himself wondering when Jason would mention his nudity but Jason never did. Jeff felt good about being naked so by the time Jason put the hamburgers on the table, Jeff stopped covering himself. Meanwhile, Jason had taken off his shirt, shoes and socks while cooking.<br />
<br />
Jason was very fit. He didn&#39;t have large muscles but the muscles he had were well defined with no gut. Jason had more hair on his chest too and a well defined treasure trail.<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;You want to go home but I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t want to tell your parents about turning into a mannequin. You also don&#39;t want to explain how you got blue pubes. Am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;Have you thought of a story to tell them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;That&#39;s a tough one. Are they missing you? Would they have already filed a missing persons report on you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I don&#39;t think so. This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve been away from home. They&#39;ll get mad at me for not telling them where I&#39;ve been but they know I&#39;m not a trouble maker, that I probably just stayed the night with friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;Do they know all your friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Well, while we think about it, I need some sleep to get ready for my shift tonight.&quot; He stood up and stripped off his pants and underwear until he was naked. &quot;If Miss Marple drops by, turn into a mannequin so she doesn&#39;t think you&#39;re staying with me.&quot; Jason crawled into bed before Jeff got a good look. &quot;If you get sleepy, I don&#39;t mind sharing the bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sleepy. He watched t.v. for a while but got bored. He heard Miss Marple pass by so he turned into a mannequin and found that as a mannequin, he didn&#39;t get quite so bored. Standing still just felt like something he was built to do.<br />
<br />
He could see Jason sleeping. After a few hours, Jason&#39;s blanket slipped off revealing his cock which was hard. Jeff had never been able to really look at another man&#39;s cock. Jeff wondered how his own cock compared, was his own cock a normal size, was it deformed. Jason&#39;s cock and balls did look bigger than Jeff&#39;s and Jason had this extra skin covering his cockhead. Jeff&#39;s family never told Jeff that he&#39;d been circumcised at birth so Jeff wondered if he was normal lacking that extra skin.<br />
<br />
After a while, Jeff turned human, walked over to the bed and touched Jason&#39;s cock. Jason&#39;s cock responded to the touch. Jeff delicately held Jason&#39;s cock for a few minutes, then walked away to keep Jason from discovering Jeff touching his cock.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked over to the toilet and discovered that his own dick was hard. He began to masturbate. Although he tried to imagine having sex with a female, he kept seeing Jason&#39;s face and upper body in his fantasy.<br />
<br />
Right after Jeff shot his load into the toilet, he realized that Jason was sitting up and watching him. Jeff turned red and turned away.<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;My dad said it&#39;s wrong to look at naked men?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;Why, what&#39;s so wrong about it? Are you religious?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I haven&#39;t decided. My dad says that what my science teacher teaches is pseudoscience.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;I bet your dad defines science as that which comes from his holy book. Can you think of one logical reason that makes looking bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;I&#39;m an Atheist. I care a great deal about logic and I don&#39;t care what any holy book says.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Kevin Sorebeau says that Atheists live in their mother&#39;s basement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason said, &quot;Kevin Sorebeau is an idiot. One of the most active Atheists on the internet was kicked out of his mother&#39;s home because she is a Jehovah&#39;s Witness. Kevin Sorebeau doesn&#39;t know what Atheists are like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason got out of bed and took Jeff&#39;s hands. Jason said, &quot;Just look for a while. There is nothing bad about it.&quot;</p>
