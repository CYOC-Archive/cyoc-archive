<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>For NickKaiba, this sort of thing would be better served in a PM and not made as an author&#39;s note in a chapter... but the site&#39;s &quot;link&quot; for you says &quot;user does not exist.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But anyone can post in the interactives and this could well mean working with those that may not share in all of your personal desires. Adding them isn&#39;t necessarily bad, as I&#39;d think most authors do put a bit of themselves into what they post here. And many may focus their attention solely on the things they like or want. And that is their choice, and everyone has to accept that. And that may well include when they&#39;re &quot;working&quot; with someone else in an interactive chapter as their desires or interpretation has the real potential to be different from yours.<br/>
<br/>
Working together is then more an exercise in creativity in having a story being told by two or more people come together and make sense.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luna was about to continue and you watched as a smile seemed to form across her muzzle when you watched her left ear twitch. At about the same time, you heard a few padded footsteps moving across the carpet in the hallway and that got your right ear to twitch. It left both of you pausing and then turning to the doorway that lead out into the hall. It was left open when you and Luna had brought in the clothes that you would keep from your old home and other things that fit inside the duffel bag and laid on the floor of Luna&#39;s room. You&#39;d placed the bag underneath one of the two windows in the room. The pane was closed and this left the white window shade hanging straight down. It was fairly sheer and it wouldn&#39;t surprise you if people were in the Vaxer&#39;s backyard at the time, they could have well made out the nude MILF-wolves in Luna&#39;s room and standing near the window. A part of that excited you in a way, though that related to the news reports that MILF-wolves seemed more eager to share their form with others than other werewolves did.<br />
<br />
The big thing from this was that it also let the light from the full moon come in through the window and your new eyes could easily see all the details of Luna&#39;s room. It wasn&#39;t some stereotypical girls room full of pinks and boy band posters. The walls were painted a light gray and that worked with the light blue carpeting on her floor. The Queen sized bed the two of you were presently cuddled on was a darker blue and the soft cotton actually felt nice against your fur, even if yours and Luna&#39;s digitigrade feet ended up stretching beyond the base of the bed. Between the two windows was a bookshelf/dresser, with many of the same books that had been on your old bookshelf on Luna&#39;s. Opposite you was a larger dresser along the far wall, that was moved in enough that the door to Luna&#39;s room could swing all the way open without hitting it. Along the north wall of the room was a set of sliding doors that lead into Luna&#39;s closet, and you figured eventually the clothes you&#39;d brought from home and the clothes that would fit your new human form would join Luna&#39;s clothes in there, though she&#39;d likely also need new clothes to fit her more mature form... and inevitably to allow her to get through her pregnancy.<br />
<br />
But since entering Luna&#39;s room and cuddling with her a bit, your focus had remained on her. It was something that brought all those feelings of love that you&#39;d essentially burried all through high school not realizing that Luna actually loved you back. Her blonde furred lupine face didn&#39;t change that and the wolf in you actually found Luna even more beautiful that way. You hoped all your changes made you beautiful too, particularly as you looked past Luna to a an end table that held her own bedside lamp and clock. With them, was a framed photograph of you and Luna from a few weeks ago. The image had the young male you with one arm around Luna&#39;s shoulder and Luna&#39;s arm around your shoulder. The pair of you had your heads leaned toward each other and you even thought that your head was actually touching her head in the photo. Now, though, the approaching footsteps turned you and Luna toward the doorway, where Kellie soon appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good... the two of you are here,&quot; Kellie said slowly, &quot;and looking good together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... yes we do,&quot; Luna answered and licked your cheek, &quot;what&#39;s up mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roxie and I will be going out to get in contact with the other MILF-wolves in the area and any other werewolves and provide the warning about the Wolf Hunters that Abigail Maxwell warned Nicki of,&quot; Kellie spoke, &quot;and for the time being... it would be best if you and Nicki stayed inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think they might be here?&quot; you blurted as you and Luna actually sat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust the warning,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; you answered, &quot;my stepmother wouldn&#39;t lie or say anything deceptive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that then makes the warning worth heeding,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;particularly while we don&#39;t have confirmation about the Wolf Hunters. If they are coming here or are already here... they are likely to first check and scout the areas in the woods where we like to hunt deer, have fun with other werewolves, or induct new weres... regular or MILF-wolves. And as much as I would love giving willing men and women the option of becoming MILF-wolves if they wanted, it won&#39;t be safe to do that until we&#39;re certain that the Wolf Hunters aren&#39;t in the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if they come here?&quot; Luna asked, her voice growing nervous and one hand sneaking its way inside your arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;The area still has a neighborhood watch and trying to break in would remove many of the advantages the Wolf Hunters have,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;they&#39;re not going to try something huge at the start. It&#39;d only get them arrested or in a high speed chase. They have a reputation for arson at times, but those cases have all been in areas more rural than where we are or with most of the members in the state in question participating and thus having a lower chance of immediate arrest. And some of them were more on suspicion of the buildings having werewolves of some kind in them. Right now... it&#39;d be best to warn all the pack members we can so that they aren&#39;t out and alone and thus easy targets.&quot;<br />
<br />
You patted Luna&#39;s hand as you seemed to feel Luna shudder with nervousness over this. Some of this was to be expected. You hadn&#39;t necessarily paid super close attention to the actions of groups like the Wolf Hunters, largely because they hadn&#39;t been a problem in the town before and you&#39;d never heard reports on them coming in before. There were some incidents here and there in other places over the past few years, and seemed to have been supercharged in the past year because of other political reasons, but they were still away from your home town and where most MILF-wolves tended to be. They&#39;d spread over the past eighteen years and it was the news reports on that that you followed more closely, and ultimately because of the male to female aspect of the transformation for males.<br />
<br />
But you also reasoned that Kellie&#39;s reasoning made sense. So far as you knew, most cases where non-werewolves became werewolves were either from accidents, such as the blood transfusions from werewolves to normal humans during the World Wars, or cases where a rogue were attacked someone and the victim survived, or in the most common way, when a werewolf fell in love with a normal human. This generally left these sorts of things rather rare in history and often lead to some low level forms of restriction to prevent there being too many werewolves, even as governments moved to protect them legally. However, after the World Wars, when the werewolf population exploded when a great many normal humans got blood from werewolves, many of those things began to change and changed various aspects of society. It gave those who were &quot;furries&quot; a way to indulge in their own fantasies and ultimately added a new way that normal humans became werewolves, by deliberate induction.<br />
<br />
And most if not all of the MILF-wolf transformations fell into that latter category from what was reported. That some women liked some things about being a MILF-wolf, and you figured that there may have been some men here or there that wanted the same thing, and thus got in contact with a MILF-wolf, or someone they thought was a MILF-wolf to arrange for the transformation. There were some accidents and surprises, like with Kellie getting accidentally bitten by a sick werewolf and with her not knowing that the MILF-wolf strain of the virus would turn her husband into a MILF-wolf too. There were also the occasions where a lone man walking home came across a horny MILF-wolf and thought it was a normal female werewolf. The cases of people getting attacked by werewolves or MILF-wolves was so small it was hard to prove many of the old stories wrong.<br />
<br />
However the sorts of ceremonies where werewolves and in the last few years, MILF-wolves, inducted new willing members could be big and could also attract attention. You remembered seeing a news report on a Hollywood star a year or so ago who&#39;d fallen in love with a male werewolf and her induction into the pack that werewolf belonged to got a lot of media attention. You figured that the local MILF-wolves and werewolves had something similar, which had been part of why you&#39;d initially come looking to speak with Kellie. However, if these events attracted attention or were well known to parts of town, it was all quite possible that the Wolf Hunters would find out about them. They may not have millions of members, but the ones they did have weren&#39;t necessarily stupid and had the potential to be quite violent. Thus, Kellie&#39;s idea to warn the other MILF-wolves and werewolves in town made sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your friends?&quot; you asked, getting the sense that Luna&#39;s worries for her mother were growing.<br />
<br />
&quot;They may be in positions of some ability to confirm what your stepmom overheard, Nicki,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;but I really can&#39;t address that until tomorrow as they aren&#39;t werewolves or MILF-wolves. Going to them now... and in this form... would not look good. So until we can confirm whether or not the Wolf Hunters are coming here or are already in town... it would be better to be safe rather than sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you and dad?&quot; Luna asked, her voice sounding nervous, though not being afraid to be open and honest with her actual relationship to Roxie. For years, you&#39;d thought Roxie was Luna&#39;s aunt and Kellie&#39;s sister. However when learning that Kellie was the first MILF-wolf and that Luna was born a MILF-wolf, it turned out that Roxie was Kellie&#39;s husband and became a MILF-wolf because Kellie and Rook didn&#39;t know how the MILF-wolf strain worked at the time. Now that you were a MILF-wolf, that secret was no longer needed to be kept from you as you and Roxie had a lot in common in being males that became MILF-wolves.<br />
<br />
You only held Luna to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll both be careful and quick,&quot; Kellie spoke, &quot;we know where everyone likes to go to meet up if they&#39;ve decided to go out and we know the woods around here quite well. And if it weren&#39;t for the potential of the Wolf Hunters being here or on their way... we&#39;d actually take you Luna to meet the others and learn all the spots around town... and with Nicki joining you, she would be welcome to come along too. But right now this is a better to be safe than sorry situation... and you&#39;re still our baby girl... with you&#39;re own baby girl now on the way. You would be safer here with Nicki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to lose you or &quot;dad,&quot; either,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;couldn&#39;t you call them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d only work if they&#39;re home,&quot; Kellie answered, &quot;they may be out and in the woods and thus won&#39;t have their phones on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna only looked down for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But this shouldn&#39;t be too long,&quot; Kellie assured Luna, &quot;Roxie and I will go out, find everyone, relay the warning and be back. It shouldn&#39;t be more than a couple hours... three at the absolute longest. We&#39;ll be safe and we&#39;ll be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better,&quot; Luna said to Kellie, to which Kellie laughed and then departed.<br />
<br />
You and Luna listened as Kellie&#39;s footsteps grew softer and father away. Eventually things sounded pretty quiet and it was only the slamming of the back door that you and Luna could hear to indicate that Kellie and Roxie had left. Luna gave a sigh, and for the moment then leaned against you. You did all you could to keep her steady and prepared yourself to give Luna as much comfort as you could.</p>
