<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Misty encouraged Lucy to curl up on one of the side bunks with as many blankets as she could offer. Her soul felt sick inside, eclipsed by mere stomach upset and a raw throat. She felt like a precise mechanism violently smashed. Even the faintest action was impossible. Her springs had been ripped out and all the gears tangled.<br />
<br />
All this time, she thought Dina had her quirks and pet peeves along with social crusades for equality and everything. They tend to be in conflict about this but Brent always thought it was cordial. They disagreed but they talked about it and their separate points of view. Dina had to win a lot and Brent didn’t care a lick about winning. But it felt like they always made up at the end, to her. <br />
<br />
Was she just a fool? Had she always been one? A simp? Brent heard rumors from Dina‘s friends that she spent a lot of time here or there advocating and staying for several days. They always had this chuckle when they talked about it, as though there was something obvious that he clearly was missing. He didn’t mind people laughing at him though. He liked being the source of joy. He could take it.<br />
<br />
But he felt so small, soft, and frail now. The only immense part of her was the pillowy swath on her chest. The striking contrast with her tiny torso and slim body felt so deeply absurd, like she stuffed a set of volleyballs down her shirt for a gag. <br />
<br />
No, they weren’t that big. She’d seen them during the transformation. Somewhere between cantaloupes and personal watermelons. The brief notion of making a fruit salad while trying to get a solid metric gave her a moment of morbid amusement. At least they didn’t feel quite as heavy as those examples. But there was definitely a woozy, surreal tug when she leaned on her side. When standing, they tugged on her shoulders, back, neck, and pits. Like this, the weight stacked on top of itself with a twisting, sideways lean. As though someone had attached memory foam pillows across her chest and the adhesive wasn’t just at the edges but deeply inside and around her. <br />
<br />
The jiggles as she shifted in place roused innately boyish ponderings. She hadn’t really had fun with them. It was all fretful worry. Crossing her arms over them and holding as much of a mass as possible while seeking out the expanded points of her nipples felt curious and strange. Like playing around with a doll’s body. The place between her lean long thighs gave a vigorous note of approval. The slippery sensation of arousal with something she hadn’t paid attention to. It crept and snuck up on her with motions like the waves on the sea, only it acted like her entire body was made of shifting waters. <br />
<br />
Before she got carried away and did something naughty in the bunk, Lucy leaned back and let the blankets surround her slim, soft form. The exhaustion of puking along with the drain of crying made it easy for her to drift off wrapped up in soft blankets that faintly confused her senses about what soft parts were her and what soft parts were something else. <br />
<br />
Time passed without her knowing. She woke for a few moments but with the vague confusion of what was she doing in a place with bunkbeds and chairs. It had to be part of the dream drifting back to college somehow. She shrugged off the weird sensations and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
“Hey there. How are you feeling now?”<br />
<br />
Lucy cracked open her eyes. Misty ducked down looking at her. Everything about her felt so sweaty hot wrapped up like that. And her lips felt like they were about to split from dryness. Her head pounded with a faint ache. And there was a weird itchy achy dryness between her legs. She resisted the urge to scratch down there but instead shifted in the hopes that might help. All the impossible,  terrifying sensations returned. She was this skinny, bolted on boobs, slight figure of a girl for now and forever. <br />
<br />
Her eyes trembled but she seemed too dehydrated to make tears. Misty passed her a water bottle and urged her to drink. Her plump, crusty lips felt weird to accept the bottle. Bright blonde hair kept plunging over her eyes and twisting to get in her mouth. She gave a listless puff and kept drinking. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Misty asked her what her situation was now and if she had anywhere to stay. she had parents upstate but felt absolutely terrified to call on them. They hated Dina, and called her a little brat after Brent first introduced them. He actually skipped the holidays without explanation that year. They were livid for months. She had no hope they would forgive her, especially like this. <br />
<br />
So far as the apartment, Dina co-signed for it. She had every expectation that her ex probably set fire to all her possessions and was likely moving out and leaving whatever fines to Lucy. Thank God they didn’t have a joint checking account and she had left her most of her critical possessions. Lucy could return to the apartment and try to patch up the remains. But she didn’t want to stay there right now.<br />
<br />
Misty smiled. “All right then. We can swing by your place and you can grab anything you need but you’re staying with me tonight. Sound good?” Nothing lately had sounded or felt good but Lucy didn’t want to be a sad sack and dwell on that so she just smiled faintly and nodded. <br />
<br />
“This is the ladies’ break room. I can get a nice change of clothes or two from your scenario. Something to wear tonight at least. Sound good?” Lucy just nodded when she asked. She didn’t process the implication. Misty returned with a couple different choices for clothes. There were jeans, leggings, flannel and cotton pants, oversized shirts, and fitted tops along with ladies boxers and briefs. Lucy stared at the selection for a moment as though unsure what she was supposed to do with it. <br />
<br />
The nearby staff restrooms were quite occupied. Misty told her if she could just change here, that’s what everyone did. And there it struck. Lucy had found a point of acclamation. It wasn’t acceptance, it wasn’t any kind of certainty or respite. More a wobbly stone on a cliffside where she could delicately balance without falling over. Changing in front of Misty felt like a tumble. Changing in front of a girl. Never mind the fact that there were other workers coming and going. <br />
<br />
They paid little attention to her but that wasn’t the point. It was the acknowledgment of this grim reality. She could change in the ladies break room because she was a lady. She would remove her top and reveal a G cup bra on her chest and a pair of panties below. The sensations of wearing them were stressful enough but to acknowledge them was a step too far. <br />
<br />
She told Misty that the workout outfit she wore would be good enough for now. Misty offered one of the loose tops but Lucy already felt warm enough. Misty quietly gesture to her on relatively generous bust and then to Lucy’s. Brent liked to think that he was generally quick on the uptake. But all the events and the sickly feeling left a definite disconnect. When it finally clicked, Lucy sipped a little bit more of the water and adjusted her clothes.<br />
<br />
Putting on a loose top that downplayed her features definitely seemed like the ideal. At the same time, she liked the security of the relatively snug, gray outfit. Misty shrugged and bagged up the other clothes along with a gray backpack that she wore. Unfortunately, what she had on didn’t provide enough pockets for the essential reminders of her life so into the bag all her remaining possessions went. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t particularly heavy on any given day but for how Lucy felt now, it felt like a mountain of rocks she could barely lift from the floor. The fact that Misty could handle it was another wound to her ego. She was so weak, with minuscule muscles. Instead, Misty had her wear her backpack. It was at least manageable although she’s staggered, bundling her weakness into enough stability. <br />
<br />
Walking towards the center of the room, Lucy spotted something out of the corner of her eye. Her brain told her there was a cute girl over there. A sexy one with long blonde hair and tits way out. And… Yeah it was her. <br />
<br />
Glancing over, she saw the blonde with disheveled locks, plush pink lips, a tiny but curvy shape, and such a bimbo presence. Silicone beach bimbo. That’s how it felt. She swallowed. She should’ve traded tops. Walking with her wide hips felt comically bizarre. It was something she avoided thinking about before because there were much weightier issues. But the way her body shifted and her butt presented made her deeply embarrassed, like she was flaunting this body. <br />
<br />
Lucy could at least see part of what Dina claimed with how objectified she felt even by her own mind. She was a curvy butt and luscious legs with slim dainty almost child like limbs with perfect skin. She was a practically cartoonish face with wide eyes and lips meant to pout slightly open suggesting oral pleasure. And she was massive tits hanging boldly in the air with the soft implication between her thighs of a showcased sexuality. She was practically a blowup fantasy doll. Hiding at all seemed the only option. But she still avoided that. <br />
<br />
Walking out, she noticed that the eyes of Misty’s female coworkers also caught on Lucy’s absurd features. She clung to the straps of the backpack with her tiny hands buried inside the long sleeves. Misty stopped to be social with a few of the other girls and pass around jokes that went over Lucy‘s head. At one point, Lucy grasped that the gasping she heard was about her situation. The other ladies shook their head with what Misty told them of Dina and ended conversations with a hand on Lucy‘s shoulder and even going so far as to hug her from the side. <br />
<br />
She heard so many words passing back-and-forth. So sorry. Oh my gosh. Poor guy. At least you’re pretty. Just like what happened to you? I wish I could help. Does she need a ride? Are you two going to be OK? Is she going to be OK? Is there anything you can do? <br />
<br />
Onward and onward with the kind of questions that dipped through her thoughts as well. She spoke listlessly but as politely as possible. The presence of the place made her feel simultaneously an abject outsider yet viciously invited. Brent once cracked a few jokes about the female hive mind when observing Dina with her chittering girlfriends. But it was comforting while also completely terrifying. Like the group was running the process of her thoughts faster than she could think them. <br />
<br />
A very big lady enveloped her like a mother bear before they finally left. Lucy worried that she might snap like a twig. Once outside the break room, she saw that all the bright areas in the boutique were shut down with people cleaning up and powering down the equipment. With the artificial light of the shopping plaza it was hard for her to tell what time it was. Misty said it was around 10 PM with only the movie theater and the bar at the front open. Lacey lamented that she slept so many hours and yet didn’t feel recovered.<br />
<br />
The gauntlet before her represented the uncertainty of the bar and theater. She imagined drunks and random men standing and waiting for someone like her to walk along. Dina would decry catcalls and flirting as the worst of men. <br />
<br />
The plaza stretched with shuttered businesses. Listening, Lucy heard a sound like something grilling on a range or popcorn baking furiously. Misty sighed and apologized for not checking the weather earlier. Lucy remembered a flash flood warning but she and Dina expected to miss it by several hours. It was really coming down.<br />
<br />
At least the sound and presence of the rain provided a distraction from the loitering crowds ahead of her. Walking like this felt like a trick and a promise. A trick that she knew the shifting of her widened hips and a promise that so long as she didn’t think about it, she wouldn’t trip. She edged close to Misty for safety and barely dared to breathe.<br />
<br />
The bar came first with loud karaoke filtering through. A group of men laughed together off to the side and seemed to be telling jokes. To keep her mind off it, Misty inquired what kind of drinks Lucy liked. Lucy wasn’t much of a drinker but she remembered a few themed things from college. Grenadine also popped in her mind. Misty noted that was just a flavoring. She recounted a plethora of stylish mixes, especially ones with suggestive names. <br />
<br />
Before Lucy even realized it they were not only pass the bar but around the line of people waiting for an 11 o’clock showing at the theater and into the area that insulated the outdoor section from the indoors. Lucy‘s heart began to slowly settle as she realized no one had whistled at her, barely anyone looked her way, and if they had it was just a quick glance. Despite how small that moment was, she deeply appreciated it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, waves of torrential rain splattered the glass door in front of them. With a deep breath, Misty tied her hair back and then quietly offered the same for Lucy. She made sure anything that might get damaged by the rain was packed in plastic and tightly secured. She gripped Lucy’s hand and slipped it in with everything she was carrying. It felt kind of like a three legged race but with their arms.<br />
<br />
They waited till some thing that appeared like a lull and pushed forward. It was crazy outside. Lucy thought it was as heavy as the method of transformation they gave to the nano. This round was like a shower turned up. Everything got drenched and she could barely see across the parking lot. They didn’t sprint or scamper but continue to walk steadily as their shoes got waterlogged. Lucy shivered as it felt like her clothes were plastered to her. Right when it’s felt she might be blasted over by the wind, Misty pressed her car fob and the doors to a silver truck slightly popped open. <br />
<br />
Despite how much her dinky arms struggled to do their part with the load, Lucy shifted as though she was gonna carry that bundle the rest of the way. Misty unlaced herself and urged Lucy to hurry over to the driver side. Somehow, they both made it with gasps and a faint giggle from Lucy. Misty chuckled too as she looked in the overhead mirror.<br />
<br />
From the back, she retrieved two large towels, passing one over to Lucy first before draping the other across her shoulders. Lucy shivered slightly despite the warmth of the night and huddled beneath the towel. She could see a set of vast erect lewd nipple vividly traced by her drenched clothes. She made sure that was covered up first as Misty started the truck and turned on the defroster for the windshield. Soon, they were on their way.</p>
