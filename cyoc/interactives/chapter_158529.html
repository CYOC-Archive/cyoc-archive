<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was so exhausted from his day that he didn’t even bother to dress himself after his shower. The young man had fallen on top of his bed, his towel barely draped over his frame and fallen asleep. The sound of the door opening did little to stir him from his slumber, nor the light that seeped into the room from the hallway. <br />
<br />
Joan entered slowly, the smell reverberating in her nostrils. Immediately she recognised it. James, her own kin. That’s what she could smell. She stopped in her tracks, letting the light bask over her firstborn. He had changed since last she saw him. Changed so beautifully. She admired the twin mounds that adorned her son&#39;s chest. How big they looked. How good they would surely feel beneath her fingers. She gripped her own breasts as she slid the door shut, begging her approach to the bedside. Joans chubby member had spring to life, already leaking with excitement.<br />
<br />
“Mhmm James…” She cooed, her hooves lightly clopping against the wood, lightly stirring him from his slumber. James groaned in response, still deep in sleep. Soon he was within arms reach, her fingers letting go of her own flesh as she caressed his. Beginning at his ankles she gently glided her finger upwards, using it to hook under the towel and pry the distracting garment away from James’ revealing his naked form. “It’s me beautiful” She cooed again, taking the sleeping man’s hand in her own, guiding his open palm towards her throbbing member. Much to her delight, his grip tightened.<br />
<br />
“M-mellissa…” He murmured in his sleep, his own phallus beginning to inflate, sliding up against his chest, nestling beneath his new breasts. His grip on Joans cock tightened, and his expression shifted to confusion. “No…” He mumbled. “Dakota…” he whispered with a pleasurable moan. The scenes in his head shifted. It was her. She came back to him. His body shook, rolling in a light daze. His grip loosened and eventually fell limp as he landed on his front. His bare ass was exposed before the horny goat. <br />
<br />
Joan offered no correction. Who he thought she was was of no importance to her. In that moment she lacked the critical thinking to ponder who this Dakota was, just that it was her ticket in.<br />
<br />
“Mhmm, that’s right baby. I’m Dakota.” Joan mewed, taking in her sons pert ass. “And I want you….” Joan crawled onto the bed, the mattress barely sinking under the two adults&#39; weight. She caressed his cheeks, moulding them in her hands as her sleeping son reacted in kind. He pushed back instinctively, arching his back and raising his ass… presenting himself to Joan. She leaned further in, the scent that was driving her closer filled her nostrils, clouding her mind completely as she spread his cheeks.Joans assessment was quick, her body to needy to dote on his distinct lack of a female sex - She could still make this work.<br />
<br />
James moaned as he felt his ass being fondled. In his mind he was back in the woods. Dakota was behind him, but this time he was ready - He wanted to be mounted. He could feel her muzzle make contact, her wet tongue darting out, lapping at his rear. His eyes clenched at the sensation, he wanted her inside, it didn’t matter how. If this is how she wanted him, this is how she could have him. James bucked backwards, drinking in the foreign sensation, his entire body shaking in anticipation ‘Mount me’.<br />
<br />
Back in the bedroom Joan lifted her head from between her sons cheeks, saliva dripping from her mouth as she pulled his hips upright, level with her aching erection. “That’s a good boy…” She moaned as she relented, pushing the dripping head of her cock against James’ ass, feeling it slide and give as her cock was enveloped.by it’s warmth.<br />
<br />
“Mhmm Dakota!” James groaned as his eyes flew open, quickly trying to reconcile his dream with the world around him. He looked down at his hands, gripping the sheets tightly. His breasts were swinging, slapping against one another as he was rocked back and forth. He felt so full, a warmth was spreading deep within his abdomen, but this wasn’t the Woods and Dakota couldn’t be....<br />
<br />
“James! Yes!” He heard his mother cry, before feeling the grip on his ass tighten. His mouth hung open and saliva flew out as he was caught off guard, spinning his head he saw his mother&#39;s form. Her own breasts fostling against her body as she thrust in and out. He saw her blushing wild face and watched in horror as her ears began to contort, pulling outwards into oval shapes, their bare flesh quickly being coated with fur. They were becoming a part of her, twitching as her face did, so long and goat-like. Goat. Not donkey. This was all wrong. <br />
<br />
“N-nooo!” James cried, trying his best to free himself, though everywhere he turned caused his body to writhe in more please. As he pushed back he met Joan’s penis, pushing it deeper into his ass. He collapsed onto the bed, but Joan continued, rubbing his cock against the sheets and building more friction.”Why am I enjoying this?! I shouldn’t be enjoying this?!” James’ mind screamed, but that voice was growing quieter. A new sensation was taking its place. James’ taint began to crawl, a subtle fold forming along its length. The tissue separated, tunneling deep inside him as the new passages insides began to line itself with pleasure receptors. Each of Joans&#39; thrusts now graced his new vagianl lining, sending shivers down the young man&#39;s spine, turning his legs to jelly. “Is this… What it’s like?!” James mumbled, his hands curling around some blankets as his face rubbed against the bed. He couldn’t move, everything was too pleasurable. His voice turned to a whimper as his protests subsided. Instinctively his hips splayed outwards, taking on a feminine width as he bucked backwards to meet his mother. His cock was aching, so close to release, but there was something else. A pressure growing in his groin, he wanted more, pushing harder against Joan as he sought this new sensation.He could feel it on the horizon, he was so close when suddenly his penis gave in. “Unghhhh!” He moaned, climaxing onto the bed sheets, coating his breasts once more with his mammoth length.<br />
<br />
<br />
James’ whimperings fell on deaf ears, even as Joan’s new ones twitched and shivered. She was so close. She’d done so well, saving herself from fucking Jess. Not touching herself to the sounds of them fucking. This was her reward. James would be hers. She felt her son tighten around her and that was all she could take. Joan grunted, gripping his hips as she pulled him in tight.With her head throw back she came inside him, before the two collapsed in a pile of sweat and cum.</p>
