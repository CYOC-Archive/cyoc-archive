<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was early the next day when Jesse woke up, yawning and stretching as the sun came in through the window.  She had slept without any covers last night, so that in the morning the sun would hit her fully. That and she was currently naked. Rubbing her eyes Jesse looked over at her dresser, slowly getting out of bed with her breasts jiggling. Her firm and ripe belly was as large as ever when Jesse bent over and pulled some clothes out of the dresser.<br />
<br />
Pulling her panties and shorts on Jesse went for her shirt. Pulling out one of her shirts she pulled it one, getting it over her breasts, but not without stretching it to the limit. &quot;I&#39;m glad we&#39;re going shopping today, I need to get some more shirts.&quot; jesse complained as she tapped her belly, feeling the firm skin of her ripe stomach. &#39;Maybe we could get some taps, try and get some of the juice out.&#39; Jesse thought, thinking of a way to make herself just a little small in the stomach region. Other then her ripe and round belly, she had a figure most human girls would kill for. Stretching her arms and legs she grunted as she lowered them, looking in the mirror at herself and her hair, which was still as wild as ever. &quot;Amazonian beauty at it&#39;s finest.&quot; Jesse complimented herself with a smile as she left her room.<br />
<br />
Nicky was already on the patio, naked with her clothes sitting on the table next to her. &quot;Hey Jess.&quot; Nicky said, looking over at Jesse as she sat on the chair next to her to soak up some rays. &quot;Hey Nicky, you ready to go to the mall today?&quot; Jesse asked as Nicky nodded. &quot;You know it, I just have to get dressed.&quot; Nicky said as she got up slowly. &quot;You sure that shirt&#39;s gonna fit you little miss pudgy?&quot; Jesse asked with a smirk as Nicky pouted cutely. &quot;I&#39;m not pudgy! I&#39;m ripe, like you!&quot; Nicky said as she pulled her panties and shorts up, pulling her shirt over her head and getting it just over her breasts, unable to cover even the top of her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking we could try and get some taps at the mall, you know? Let out some juice?&quot; Jesse suggested as Nicky nodded. &quot;You know we&#39;ll just fill up once we get more water in us right? And we drink water by the gallon practically.&quot; Nicky pointed you. &quot;I know, but it would be nice to be thin again for a bit.&quot; Jesse said as Nicky nodded. &quot;You can be thin, I&#39;m not letting out my juice.&quot; Nicky said as Jesse shrugged. &quot;To the mall then?&quot; Jesse asked as she got up. &quot;To the mall!&quot; Nicky shouted as the two melon girls walked out to go to the mall.<br />
<br />
An hour later they had arrived, Jesse stepping out of the car and onto the black pavement with her bare green feet. &quot;I really don&#39;t like these parking lots, they aren&#39;t natural.&quot; Jesse complained as Nicky jumped out of the passenger seat and closed her door, her sandaled feet standing on the black road. &quot;You really like the natural aspects of life don&#39;t you Jess?&quot; Nicky asked as Jesse smirked at her. &quot;You know it. The beach, the park, the forest. The less... humanity the better.&quot; Jesse said as Nicky huffed. &quot;Even though we are half human ourselves?&quot; Nicky asked as Jesse rolled her eyes. &quot;Yep, I like human advancements and all, just wish they&#39;d be more natural.&quot; Jesse said as she and Nicky walked into the mall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just get some clothes and your tap and go, I don&#39;t like being out of the sunlight.&quot; Nicky said as she bolted for the clothing store, moving faster then someone as fat as her had any right to through the crowded mall. &quot;Wait for me Nicky!&quot; Jesse shouted as she ran after Nicky, her bare feet slapping against the marble floor, but she paid no heed, it didn&#39;t hurt her at all.<br />
<br />
An hour later the girls had tried on several outfits and bikinis, comparing against each other and chuckling all the while as they walked out of the clothing store with their selections, a small tap hidden underneath all the clothes. &quot;To the park?&quot; Jesse asked. &quot;Actually I was thinking of a few hours in the woods behind our place, less people that way.&quot; Nicky suggested as Jesse shrugged. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s do it.&quot; Jesse said as they walked back to the car to drive home.<br />
<br />
A few hours later the two melon girls were strolling naked through the forest, enjoying the sun coming in from the trees on their ripe bodies as they walked through the forest. &quot;I always enjoy coming out here.&quot; Jesse said with a smile as Nicky rolled her eyes. &quot;Yes Amazon, you like the woods.&quot; Nicky said as Jesse smirked. &quot;You know it. Why don&#39;t we take a dip in the spring, soak up some water as well.&quot; Jesse suggested as Nicky nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll race you!&quot; Nicky shouted as she ran towards the spring. &quot;I&#39;ll beat you!&quot; Jesse shouted, the two girls running through the woods with ease towards the spring.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later both girls had reached the spring, standing proudly in front of it as Jesse stood tall. &quot;I won Nicky!&quot; Jesse said proudly as Nicky pouted. &quot;You&#39;re taller, you have longer strides.&quot; She complained as Jesse took a few steps back before taking a running leap and jumping into the spring with a massive splash, getting Nicky all wet as Jesse looked up from the spring. &quot;Thanks for that.&quot; Nicky said, actually happy she was wet as she took a few steps back and took her own jump into the spring, splashing water all over Jesse as Jesse giggled and lowered her mouth into the water as Nicky did the same.<br />
<br />
The too spent a few minutes taking in all the water they could handle, through already ripe and juicy bellies growing even larger, by a single inch in size, before they came up. &quot;Love that natural water.&quot; Jesse said with a smile as water flowed out of her mouth and back into the spring. &quot;Humans just don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s about, we take whatever water we need and don&#39;t complain about it.&quot; Nicky said as she floated on the water, wiggling her toes as she floated around the spring. &quot;Yep, need all that &#39;purification&#39; to drink water these days. Not even pure, after all, this is pure water.&quot; Jesse said as she floated next to Nicky.<br />
<br />
The two girls spent an hour soaking in the suns rays before they got out and walked back towards their house. Water glistened on their skin as they walked back inside and into the living room to take their favorite seats to enjoy the rest of the sun. &quot;Today was a nice day.&quot; Jesse said as she reclined in the chair, letting her vines and leaves soak up as much sun as they wanted as Nicky did the same. &quot;Tomorrow is school and then the beach.&quot; Nicky said as Jesse groaned. &quot;School, I hate school. Jesse complained as Nicky rolled her eyes. &quot;I do too Jess, everyone does. But we still have to do it.&quot; Nicky said as she got up. &quot;Night Jesse.&quot; Nicky said as she went to her room. &quot;Night Nicky.&quot; Jesse said as she got up and went to the kitchen to get something.<br />
<br />
Now that she was alone she pulled out a pitcher from the cabinet and the tap she had bought at the mall. &quot;Time to let out some juice.&quot; She muttered as she sat on the floor, the pitcher between her legs as she held the tap up to her stomach, right where her belly button was. After a quick breath she stabbed the tap into her belly button.<br />
<br />
Instantly she felt the tap inside her, she fought to keep herself from moaning as she lined the tap up with the pitcher. Opening the tap she moaned in pleasure as juice flowed out of the tap and into the pitcher, her ripe belly deflating about an inch before she stopped with the full pitcher. Breathing heavily Jesse let a goofy grin slide across her face as she looked at the pitcher of juice in front of her. She had only let out an inch of her juice and it was already full! <br />
<br />
Lying on her back Jesse slowly pulled the tap out of her stomach, feeling the hole it had created with her finger as it slowly sealed back up. She held the tap up to her face with a smile. &quot;Thank you discount juice tap.&quot; She said sarcastically before laughing and slowly standing up, drops of juice falling from her recently sealed stomach as she put the tap in the sink and washed it. &quot;More for tomorrow then. I&#39;ll actually get to be thin again for our trip to the beach.&quot; Jesse said with a smile as she put the pitcher of juice in the fridge before going to her room and pulling her clothes off, falling asleep naked on the bed.</p>
