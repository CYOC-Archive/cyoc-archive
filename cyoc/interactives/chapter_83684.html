<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four sat quietly in what had once only been Sally&#39;s apartment. Charlie hadn&#39;t been evicted from his apartment, as any mess and damage that occurred during the outbreak in Fee City was written off as an effect of the outbreak, but shi decided to move into Sally&#39;s apartment and they&#39;d raise their children there, as Charlie&#39;s apartment required some structural repairs after Nikole had broke in during the outbreak. Sally also figured that some of it was to put some distance between them and Jack and Caitlyn. Shi couldn&#39;t complain about that, though, as allowed them to live together and Sally loved hir mate.<br />
<br />
And life was slowly returning to normal in Fee City, though with several obvious changes. The outbreak had turned most of the people into Chakats, and Charlie remembered it well. Seeing the news report and getting the vibrator covered in Caitlyn&#39;s cum and semen, then having a drop fall on &quot;his&quot; knee. Then he found himself fleeing from his own mother, whom he didn&#39;t recognize at the time and then finding out that his girlfriend Sally Cain had already been clawed and had become a Chakat. But despite the fact that Sally had control of herself, the virus in Caitlyn&#39;s sexual juices had been absorbed through his skin and Charlie fast became a Chakat, hirself. Shi and Sally rushed in fear that Jess would end up becoming a mindless Chakat too, and found that the Virus didn&#39;t effect her. Satisfied that Jess was safe, Charlie and Sally left to be with each other one last time before the police or the army stormed the city to stop the virus.<br />
<br />
But the army never came, and the Chakats largely remained in Fee City, as far as they knew. And after expending all the sexual energy that went along with the transformation, most of the Chakats actually found themselves regaining control over themselves. And in that society in Fee City began to change and change rapidly. The first to go was laws regarding the forbidding of public nudity. Being covered in fur, Chakats found cloth to be irritating, and within the city they had no problem with being naked. Sex was also something that had changed. With every Chakat being naked, the concept of sex being something private went out the window. Even with control over their lusts, Chakats still seemed enjoy mating a lot, and over the course of the week, Charlie and Sally had noticed a couple of Chakats having sex out in the open from time to time. They&#39;d even mated out in one of Fee City&#39;s public parks while discussing how to tell Jess that they were pregnant. Some had their relationships strengthened by it and some had embraced the sort of &quot;free love&quot; thing that Nikole had said Maurice Chakat wanted.<br />
<br />
What had puzzled Charlie and Sally was why the government never stormed in to contain them. Then came the phone call from Jess. Despite all their efforts during the outbreak to protect Jess Cain and keep her from becoming a Chakat, they&#39;d found out that Jess had turned herself into a Foxkat, a hermaphroditic foxtaur and had taken Nikole as hir mate. Charlie had wondered why hir girlfriend&#39;s sister had chosen hir mother as hir mate, and the roar Sally gave at finding out that Jess wasn&#39;t human anymore betrayed hir opinion. Things then calmed down when Jess explained that becoming a Foxkat was more of an improvisation when they couldn&#39;t get access to the Chakat Industries labs without Catherine &quot;Snowy&quot; Snow watching, but with it, Jess had created a vaccine that would stop the spread of the virus and while Fee City would lose all its humans, the Chakats from there wouldn&#39;t spread the virus outside of Fee City... at least not directly. <br />
<br />
The call also explained the naked Foxkats that Charlie and Sally had seen on occasion, and by doing so, Jess had apparently gotten the government to not take them out, and apparently an agent or two from outside the quarantine zone had actually become a Foxkat willingly. Some of it created an odd sort of image as the Chakats resembled all sorts of different cat species or hybridized versions of various cat species, as Sally as a panther Chakat and Nikole was a white Turkish Angora Chakat, and Charlie was a Cheetah/Turkish Angora hybrid Chakat... but the Foxkats all resembled Fennec Foxes. But, then, the only DNA used to create the Foxkat Vaccine had come from Ryles, Jess&#39;s pet Fennec and thus they didn&#39;t have enough variations in the DNA line for the vaccine for multiple species.<br />
<br />
And now they all sat together in what was the living room of Sally and Charlie&#39;s apartment. It had lost all its couches, chairs, things that were sat on, as the Chakats and Foxkats rapidly found that with the taur-like bodies, they couldn&#39;t easily sit on furniture made for humans, and with everyone in Fee City being either a Chakat or a Foxkat, there was no need for them. Desks and tables were still there, but a Chakat or Foxkat would sit back on their rear legs to use them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Sally said slowly as they sat there, unsure as to where things would go, with the syringes broken, &quot;we&#39;re all pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would appear so,&quot; Jess said with a smile, and wagged hir tail along the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could a Chakat and Foxkat get pregnant?&quot; Charlie wondered, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you be too different now to be compatible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jess answered, &quot;but I also don&#39;t care. I&#39;m pregnant and I&#39;m happy to be pregnant... with my mate by my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I always will be,&quot; Nikole purred to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both happy for you both,&quot; Charlie answered, &quot;and we&#39;re happy that you&#39;re happy... it&#39;s just got me curious...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though your choice of mate is still going to make things confusing,&quot; Sally said, half scolding, half teasing, &quot;Charlie and I are carrying Nikole&#39;s grandchildren. Both of you are carrying Charlie&#39;s brothers or sisters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sithers, combine the two,&quot; Jess chuckled, &quot;since none of us have a easily determinable gender now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And to me, your children are my nieces or nephews,&quot; Sally finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Niphews,&quot; Jess corrected, &quot;to be correct for hermaphrodites.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will be fine,&quot; Nikole said optimistically, &quot;I&#39;m sure in nine months we&#39;ll have everything in order in how our kids will be related to each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Charlie replied crossing hir arms over hir chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Charlie,&quot; Nikole then gave a short smile, &quot;how is impending motherhood treating you as a former man?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie looked down to hir cat part of her body, where hir reproductive organs were all located. Shi then gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really only just started, but strangely... it makes me feel happy,&quot; Charlie smiled, &quot;a baby Chakat is growing in me and feel happy... I can almost feel it growing there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re adapting well,&quot; Nikole commented and came forward to nuzzle hir son/daughter or soughter as Jess combined son and daughter. <br />
<br />
Nikole then purred to show her parental pride in her only child. She was also exciting for starting a new family with Jess. She privately wondered if her new baby would be a Chakat like her or a Foxkat like Jess, or would it be a hybrid the way Charlie was, having Chakat and Foxkat features. She figured she&#39;d find out in time, and was glad to have it and glad to have Jess with her. Jess was very forgiving and loving, caring and strong, smart and brave. In a way, Jess reminded Nikole of Sully, Charlie&#39;s father, who sadly died of cancer two years before the Chakat virus outbreak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you told us we&#39;d never be human again,&quot; Charlie answered, &quot;I&#39;ll always have these spots, the yellowish fur with a white underbelly... modest breasts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;ll get bigger when you start lactating, dear,&quot; Nikole told hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joy,&quot; Charlie commented, &quot;but since we can&#39;t go back... might as well go all out. I have Sally with me. I&#39;m going to give birth to hir child, she will give birth to mine. I&#39;m happy and she&#39;s happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all I could want,&quot; Nikole answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But in the meantime, you two will need the vaccine,&quot; Jess spoke up, &quot;I know you won&#39;t spread the virus deliberately, but you can never tell what could happen. You wouldn&#39;t want to be mating with Sally and have a random human walk by and you erupt on that human...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... we wouldn&#39;t want that... especially not if we could potentially infect someone,&quot; Sally nodded, &quot;but what are we to do? The syringe is broken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s only one way,&quot; Jess said slowly, &quot;I mate with Charlie and Nikole mates with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Sally said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gave the vaccine to Nikole when I mated with her for the first time and now Nikole carries the vaccine as well,&quot; Jess answered, &quot;It&#39;s how we Foxkats have stopped the spread of the Virus... at least from Fee City directly. One of the FBI agents that came in and took the serum for the Foxkat vaccine said something about the fear that the virus was already shipped out of Fee City before the outbreak here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally and Charlie traded nervous glances at the prospect of people having to wrestle with sex-crazed Chakats like they had to.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only other option is that I mate with both of you, and while I love you, Sally, I love you like a sither as you are my sither,&quot; Jess finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;And since all four of us are pregnant already, there is no risk of you carrying my child or Charlie carrying your sither&#39;s,&quot; Nikole added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sally said slowly, &quot;but you won&#39;t take Charlie from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Nikole is my mate,&quot; Jess answered, &quot;The four of us are a pack... or pride depending on whether you want to put it in canine or feline terms but Nikole is my mate and Charlie is your mate within our group.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Sally nodded and looked over to Nikole, &quot;Let&#39;s go to the bedroom... Charlie and I have the plastic sheets there so that we don&#39;t make a mess that will need to be clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nikole nodded and let Sally lead the way. Charlie also turned to follow hir mate and hir mother, and let Jess fall in alongside hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... have you liked sex from the... from the male perspective?&quot; Charlie asked, feeling hir penis begin to grow erect beneath hir. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you that I&#39;ve found it to be enjoyable from the female side of things... when Sally mounted me while we were in heat... to feel hir cum in me...it was all I could do to stay conscious... it felt that good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like shi&#39;s set the bar rather high for me to try and match,&quot; Jess said with a chuckle, &quot;and to feel my penis slide into Nikole and to feel hir squeeze it... yes. I also find that enjoyable. Though I think a lot of this is the result of our transformations. We&#39;re all love machines.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That we are,&quot; Charlie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t be too alarmed if my knot penetrates you,&quot; Jess said in warning, &quot;it&#39;ll go down after I cum...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Charlie gasped as Jess shut the door to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
The sounds of mating soon came from within the closed room.</p>
