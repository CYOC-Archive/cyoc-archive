<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave took a moment to think. &quot;I&#39;ve always liked the idea of a thicker cock,&quot; he said, his voice a bit shaky. &quot;But nothing too crazy.&quot;<br />
Paul nodded, his eyes focused on the task at hand. With a flick of his wrist, Dave&#39;s cock began to swell. It grew thicker and fuller before their eyes, the change gradual but undeniable. Dave let out a low whistle as he watched his cock take on a new shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s...&quot; Dave trailed off, his eyes wide as he reached down to touch his now more substantial member. The feeling was strange but not entirely unpleasant. He gave it a few experimental strokes, watching as it grew even more under his hand. &quot;It&#39;s like a whole new toy,&quot; he murmured.<br />
<br />
Paul stepped back, his smug expression never wavering. &quot;Just imagine what you could do with that,&quot; he said, his voice thick with innuendo. &quot;You&#39;ll have the ladies, and the guys, eating out of the palm of your hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, his hand still wrapped around his now-impressive girth. &quot;Yeah, I can see that,&quot; he said, giving his cock a playful squeeze.<br />
<br />
Paul leaned in, his eyes gleaming with excitement. &quot;But wait, there&#39;s more!&quot; he said, his hands hovering over Dave&#39;s crotch again. &quot;How about we give you a bit more length when it&#39;s time to perform?&quot;<br />
Dave&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Paul began, his voice a sly whisper, &quot;I can make your cock longer when it&#39;s erect, but keep it the same when it&#39;s soft. That way, you get the best of both worlds: surprise and subtlety.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without waiting for a response, energy seemingly flowed from Paul&#39;s hands to Dave&#39;s crotch. Dave watched as his penis length seemed to stay exactly the same, but oddly, his foreskin slowly stretched longer and longer. &quot;Why are you growing my foreskin&quot; Dave asked. &quot;The foreskin growth is an artifact of the drastic difference between your hard and soft length. You need to have enough skin on your shaft to make getting erect a comfortable experience. Otherwise it would be like trying to put on a glove that&#39;s too small&quot; responded Paul.<br />
<br />
As the length of Dave&#39;s foreskin overhang passed 2 inches, Dave began to get concerned &quot;Exactly how big are you making me?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Paul chuckled, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got a knack for knowing just how much is too much,&quot; he assured him. &quot;It&#39;s all about balance, my friend.&quot; &quot;Does having a hard cock longer than anyone you&#39;ve met excite you?&quot; Paul asked with a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
Dave swallowed hard, his hand still wrapped around his cock. &quot;Yeah, I mean, who wouldn&#39;t want that?&quot; he said, his voice thick with anticipation.<br />
Paul nodded, a twinkle in his eye. &quot;Consider it done,&quot; he said, and with another flick of his wrist, Dave&#39;s foreskin stretched even further, his cock still flaccid.<br />
<br />
When his foreskin was hanging down 4 inches from his cock head, Dave decided that was enough. &quot;Whoa, that&#39;s enough. Things are definitely starting to look a bit ridiculous&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Paul chuckled, &quot;Alright, alright. It&#39;s all set,&quot; he said, stepping back to admire his handiwork. &quot;Whenever you&#39;re ready to show off, you&#39;ll have the power to surprise and delight.&quot; &quot;That thick shaft kinda makes those balls underwhelming,&quot; Paul hinted, with a knowing smirk.<br />
<br />
Dave looked down at his crotch, a bit bewildered but also intrigued. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
Paul leaned in closer, his voice a whisper. &quot;Well, why not balance things out a bit?&quot; He suggested, his eyes dancing with mischief.<br />
<br />
Without waiting for an answer, Paul&#39;s hands began to glow again, and Dave felt a strange tingling sensation in his balls. He watched in amazement as they grew larger and larger, until they were the size of lemons. The feeling was a mix of pain and pleasure, a sensation he had never felt before.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; Paul asked, stepping back to admire his handiwork.<br />
Dave looked down at his now substantial package. &quot;I... I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; he managed to get out.<br />
Paul grinned. &quot;You&#39;ll get used to it. And just think, you&#39;ll be the talk of the town with those bad boys.&quot;<br />
Dave couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit of excitement at the idea of having a cock that could rival any porn star&#39;s. He had always been self-conscious about his size, and now, it was like all his wildest dreams had come true.<br />
<br />
&quot;It certainly is a weighty package&quot; Dave said as he examined his balls, both his hands barely able to contain their new size. &quot;How long did you make my cock?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Paul shrugged, his smugness growing. &quot;Let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll be the envy of every man in the city when you&#39;re fully loaded,&quot; he replied, enjoying the power he held over these unsuspecting heroes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And everything still, you know, works the same when you do this to someone?&quot; Dave asked as he contemplated the potential for Paul&#39;s powers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Generally, they work just as well after as they did before&quot; Paul responded &quot;Here, I&#39;ll do you a &quot;solid&quot;, so to say&quot; Paul said with a smirk. Once again, Dave felt a strange sensation in his crotch, as the veins on his penis became more pronounced.<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot; Dave Asked.<br />
&quot;I just made so that you can always perform, if you get my drift&quot; Paul said smirking. &quot;Let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll be able to get rock hard, like 110%, whenever and wherever. Every time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave nodded, still a little overwhelmed by the experience. He pulled his pants back up, his new assets feeling like a heavy secret between his legs. &quot;Alright, well, thanks, man,&quot; he said, trying to play it cool. &quot;We&#39;ll have to talk more about how this fits into the team dynamic.&quot;<br />
Paul gave him a knowing wink. &quot;Don&#39;t mention it,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m all about helping the little guys out.&quot;<br />
<br />
They moved back into the living room, where Dave offered him a seat. &quot;So, tell me more about yourself,&quot; Dave said, trying to get his mind back on track. &quot;What got you into this whole superhero gig?&quot;<br />
Paul leaned back, his hands behind his head. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve always had a knack for making things grow,&quot; he said with a smirk. &quot;I figured why not use it for good?&quot;<br />
Dave nodded, his eyes flickering down to the crotch of his pants, trying to ignore the question marks floating in his head. &quot;And what do you do for a living?&quot; he asked, changing the subject.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a...consultant,&quot; Paul replied vaguely. &quot;I help people with, uh, personal issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave nodded, not pushing for more details. He didn&#39;t want to pry, especially with the kind of power he had just seen in action. &quot;So, no superhero experience?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not officially,&quot; Paul said with a wink. &quot;But I&#39;ve dabbled.&quot;<br />
Dave couldn&#39;t help but wonder what kind of trouble Paul had gotten into in the past. He made a mental note to ask John about him later. For now, though, he was intrigued by the idea of someone with such an unusual power joining their team.<br />
<br />
As they talked, Dave couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that his balls were weighing him down. He shifted in his chair, trying to find a comfortable position. &quot;Hey, Paul,&quot; he said, his voice a bit tentative. &quot;What happens if someone, you know, isn&#39;t happy with the changes you make?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul looked at him, his eyes gleaming with amusement. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, buddy,&quot; he said. &quot;What I do is permanent. It&#39;s a part of you now, like your strength.&quot;<br />
Dave&#39;s stomach dropped. &quot;Permanent?&quot; he echoed. &quot;But what if someone wants to, I don&#39;t know, go back to normal?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Paul drawled, &quot;that&#39;s the thing with powers. Sometimes you gotta live with the hand you&#39;re dealt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave felt a shiver run down his spine. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked, his voice a little higher than he intended.<br />
Paul leaned forward, his expression serious. &quot;Look, man, I&#39;ve been around the block a few times. Some people are born with powers that are flashy and obvious. Others, like me, have to get creative.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave nodded, his mind racing. &quot;So, you&#39;re saying there&#39;s no way to...revert it?&quot;<br />
Paul leaned back, his arms crossing over his chest. &quot;Once I&#39;ve worked my magic, it&#39;s yours to keep. But hey, think of it as a superpower, right? And who doesn&#39;t want a little extra in the pants department? And I made sure you have much, much more than a little extra&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave grew flustered, &quot;How big did you make me?&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, only 15 inches long and 7 inches in girth&quot; Paul said cooly.<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of his head. &quot;What the fuck, man?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;That&#39;s not a little extra, that&#39;s a fucking circus act!&quot;<br />
Paul just chuckled. &quot;Well, you did ask for something special,&quot; he said. &quot;But hey, think of the perks. You&#39;ll be unstoppable in bed, and on the battlefield.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s mind raced with the implications of his new size. He had always been a confident guy, but this was something else entirely. He didn&#39;t know if he could handle the attention, or the potential ridicule. But at the same time, a part of him was... excited.<br />
<br />
Finally finding his voice, Dave told Paul, &quot;Look, man, I appreciate the, uh, the upgrade. But I think you should go now.&quot;<br />
Paul raised an eyebrow. &quot;Already? I thought we were just getting to know each other,&quot; he said, his voice laced with disappointment.<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s expression was firm. &quot;I need to think about this,&quot; he said, his eyes not meeting Paul&#39;s. &quot;This is a big change, and I need some time to process.&quot;<br />
Paul nodded, standing up from the chair with a sigh. &quot;I understand,&quot; he said, his smugness slipping away. &quot;But if you ever need anything else, you know where to find me.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Paul left Dave to contemplate his new, weighty cock, he sent a message to the mysterious figure &quot;I&#39;ve taken care of the friend. He will be very distracted. I don&#39;t imagine they&#39;ll be putting much effort into forming their team.&quot;</p>
