<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">what could he say, He didn&#39;t know what to do as he was some kind of wolfman that someone was also entering his home. Thomas started to panic even more as he was still stun on his reflection while also worrying who just entered his house, that&#39;s when he remembered his phone and what he text to his friend. quickly, he dashed over to his phone and quickly opening his text list, but what was on it made Thomas want to scream in horror as to what was on his text list that it even showed him on what he wrote. <br />
<br />
looking things over his phone that there was a text message from his friend as this is what it said to him. &quot;hey, I&#39;m gonna head to a Halloween store to buy a costume for the party. do you wanna come?&quot; he read his friend&#39;s reply before he read what he wrote. &quot;like right now, so get your money ready so we can go.&quot; as he read the response that his fears grew even more then Thomas could dream of as this was his text. &quot;sure, but I&#39;ve got my costume already. guest you&#39;ll have to pick a costume out before the party yourself. wish i could help out though, but when was the party?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas breathes heavily while trying to recover himself from the shock of what he wrote on his text, someone in the the house as his first thought was his texted friend, suck in this costume that He examines his whole body only to find out There it&#39;s no longer a costume! He uses his clawed hands that instead of fabric covering his skin, he now felt sports of grey short fur all over while feeling his new muzzle and wet nose. he soon noticed his long white hair moving with the breeze in the room, along with his new wolf tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;wow, this can&#39;t be real!&quot; Thomas says to him, now realizing his new deep wolf voice. &quot;Holy crap! how an i going to explain this to my friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
mean while as this happened, his friend entered his house. &quot;Holy crap dude, you really need to clean up a bit.&quot; his friend soon heard him up stairs and thought he was in some kind of trouble that without thinking, went up to see if Thomas was ok. stumbling a bit while heading up the stairs with a last minute suit on that it was starting to get late for the party. hearing Thomas through his door when his friend reached there that it wasn&#39;t long till his friend entered his room, while struggling with the door knob.<br />
<br />
back with Thomas as a wolfman that he sniffs the air, stretching his wolf muscles, even started to admire himself as his fears slowly faded away. When it was finished as Thomas, the Wolfman then chuckles that he jumps in shock when his door startled him. his friend quickly after enters the room that Thomas didn&#39;t had time to think on what his friend would think of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;thomas, i&#39;m here!&quot; his friend shouted as to say hello to him, while asking if he was ok. &quot;Holy crap Thomas, your costume looks even better them what mine looks like! you really do got a chance at that party we&#39;re going to, even if mine&#39;s last minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ah... Sorry, I&#39;m kind of sick. maybe another time?&quot; Thomas said while sounding sick to his friend, even if he was liying about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;wow, you DO kind of sound sick... well, if It&#39;s ok with you, then another time it&#39;ll be.&quot; His friend said as his friend started walking away. In that moment though when he let his guard down, his friend jumped him as this surprised him in shock. &quot;psyched! you can&#39;t fool me as i know you be now to pull something like this at the late minute.&quot; knowing this from his friend that he did felt sick on lying.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah man!&quot; his friend said while looking him in all the angles. &quot;if i didn&#39;t know any better, i say you were Ulric. maybe that&#39;s what i should be calling you now.&quot; feeling like his identity was being changed from being Thomas to being called Ulric that Thomas, now Ulric got a good idea of who his friend was. even under the last minute costume his friend was wearing that with a good look and the sound of his friend&#39;s voice, Ulric&#39;s friend was.....<br />
<br />
(this is where you decide who his friend is and what the last minute costume his friend&#39;s wearing. feel free to add your own story line up ideas down below as there are a few listed as his friend could be almost anyone of any age wearing just about anything. thank you and happy reading.)</p>
