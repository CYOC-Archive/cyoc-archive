<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caitlin  stood as the judge come into the room but she was glaring daggers across the courtroom at Joey who stood at the other table looking as cocky as could be. Joey Barsky was your typical college frat boy, he spent as much time at the gym or drinking as he did at classes, more. He was probably flunking most of them but his parents&#39; money kept him in school and passing. His auburn hair was usually messy, but today was styled into a presentable quiff. His usual tank top and short combo was also replaced by a suit. He was pretty good looking, handsome but with a bit of a baby face still, which is why she had slept with him, even thought he might be dating material until his personality came out. He was only nineteen though, and would probably end up being a drop-dead handsome man. She felt her lawyer put a hand on her shoulder and looked over to see her shake her head. Right. Decorum.<br />
<br />
Judge Loggia sat down and motioned for everyone else to sit, which Caitlin did gratefully. Only six months pregnant, but she was six months pregnant with twins, and standing just was not comfortable anymore. At eighteen, Caitlin herself was on the small side as well. She was petite, with a heart shaped face and long straight black hair. She was often compared to a porcelain doll. Small, delicate, and fragile. All her life she had been called pretty, but she was also smart. Smart enough to be pre-med on a full scholarship. The bailiff handed the judge a folder. &quot;Next up, Newfield v Barsky.&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge looked over the folder, though he had no doubt already read everything inside earlier. &quot;So, as I understand it, the root of this case is Miss Newfield&#39;s pregnancy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlin&#39;s lawyer stood up. &quot;Indeed your honor, Mr Barsky impregnated Miss Newfield against her will. So we are filing suit against Mr Barsky for damages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your honor,&quot; Joey&#39;s lawyer stood up. &quot;We have already offered  a sizable child support package with reasonable visitation terms to  Miss Newfield. Mr Barsky&#39;s parents are quite wealthy and the money being offered is enough to support both children and Miss Newfield.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, I have a copy of that up here.. this is.. quite a lot of money. Why is your client rejecting it?&quot; Judge Loggia looked right towards Caitlin and her lawyer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Newfield doesn&#39;t want money nor does she want children, she also doesn&#39;t believe she should have to carry the twins to term, nor care for them afterwards as they were forced upon her by Mr Barsky. She was wholly dedicated to her studies and intending to go to medical school after graduation. Children would interfere with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey&#39;s lawyer cut in. &quot;The sex was entirely consensual, even Miss Newfield doesn&#39;t deny that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlin&#39;s lawyer started up again. &quot;The condom..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Condom&#39;s break, your honor, it happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlin&#39;s lawyer smiled as her opponent stepped right into it. &quot;Especially if they&#39;re sabotaged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Objection, your honor, counsel clearly..&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlin&#39;s lawyer cut him off again, the judge was merely watching from the bench quietly. &quot;I have obtained a series of text messages that Mr Barsky sent a group chat of his fellow frat brothers.&quot; She held up the paper and began to read. &quot;Nah, bro, I totally poke holes in them so they&#39;ll break. By the time I graduate there&#39;s gonna be dozens of little Barskys all over campus.&quot;  She held out the stack of papers to the bailiff who brought them up to the judge.<br />
<br />
Both Joey and his lawyer looked ashen. As soon as the lawyer opened his mouth to speak though, Loggia held up a finger to silence him as he read through the texts. &quot;This does seem pretty cut and dry evidence of sabotaging birth control. What is Miss Newfield&#39;s claim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fifty thousand dollars for emotional damages. Plus a body swap.&quot; Caitlin&#39;s lawyer smiled over towards her colleague. &quot;Mr Barsky wants to be a parent so badly, let him.  He can finish carrying his own children to term, give birth to them and be listed as both mother AND father on their birth certificates. His family has the assets to help him take care of twins as a single mother. Miss Newfield is ready to give up any and all parental claim on both children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So a minimum swap of three years then?&quot; The judge asked, his eyes fixed on a suddenly ill looking Joey Barsky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pregnancy and birth can cause several irreversible changes in a woman&#39;s body, your honor. As such, the marks of what Mr Barsky did will be on Miss Newfield&#39;s body for life. So we are requesting a swap duration of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Life, your honor? Surely the three years is sufficient!&quot; So, they were already conceding to at least that. Caitlin felt herself smiling, her lawyer had told her the plan ahead of time. Joey&#39;s body was going to be hers. Not that she didn&#39;t like being a woman, but there was a certain appeal in having such a powerful, male body. Being able to kick the crap out of people for one.<br />
<br />
The judge spoke up. &quot;Normally in cases like this, I rule that the body swap lasts until the children reach the age of majority.&quot; Her lawyer had told her the judge would say that too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally your honor, we would be fine with that.&quot; &#39;Like hell,&#39; Caitlin thought as he lawyer continued. &quot;But Mr Barsky is an obvious nymphomaniac and reproductive abuser. We&#39;ll agree until age of dependency with the condition that Mr Barsky not get pregnant again during that time. Should he become pregnant, the swap will become permanent. If all goes well, he&#39;ll have his body back at the still young age of 37. Plenty of time to find a wife and have more children should he so desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlin wasn&#39;t worried. Joey was a known manslut around the school. Knowing him he&#39;d be knocked up again less than a year after having the twins. Caitlin also knew he was bi from one of their encounters where he begged her to peg him, then called her by his roommate&#39;s name. He&#39;d probably ride a dick the first chance he got and every chance he got.<br />
<br />
Caitlin smiled as the judge nodded his head. &quot;Seems a fair addition to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was more to be hashed out, but everything was going Caitlin&#39;s way.</p>
