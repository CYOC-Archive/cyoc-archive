<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>The sun rises and pours copious amounts of light into Bobby's room. Bobby begins to stir, not yet ready to face another day as the scrawny kid that he was. Bobby had been wanting puberty to hit him, to grow into a real man, to have a rough and tough beard and body hair abound, not to mention the ability to actually build large muscles. As he continues to move about in his bed, desperately trying to block the sun from his eyes with the covers, the barren part of his forearms brush against something, something that didn't feel right or should even be there. Curious to know what it was, Bobby opened his eyes groggily at first, looked around and almost shot out of his bed.</br>
<br>The old man in the store was right, that stuff was powerful, but boy was Bobby happy he used as much as he did. As he looked over what he could with his eyes alone, he decided he needed a better look and went into his walkin closet where he had a full body mirror. Upon opening the door and bringing the mirror to face him, Bobby's eyes grew wide in shock and amazement. Instead of the body of a scrawny 14 year old, he found himself to be a powerfully built, very hairy, chiseled featured, 35 year old man. Looking around, he saw that everything in his room was different, including the room itself. He could not believe his eyes, but he would check everything else out after viewing his whole body.</br>
<br>The only words he could use to define his body was awesome. When he went to sleep last night he was 5 feet 4 inches tall, skinny as a toothpick, lightly dusted with body hair in certain places like his pubes, pits, arms and legs. On top of that he had absolutely no muscle definition to his body. Now, on the other hand, he was much different. First of all, which might have been the one thing that was the hardest to get over, was the fact he was 35!!! He had a square chiseled jaw complete with a dark brown, almost black 5 O' clock shadow that traveled almost the length of his neck. His entire body was very muscular, muscles the size of mountains, big while yet soft, which was fine with him anyway as he definitely didn't want to be cut hard and veiny like a bodybuilder. His hands were thick, hard, caloused and cracked, while his nails were soft, trimmed and clean. His forearms were thick, leading up to the rest of the muscled body he had. His fingers, hands, forearms, mid-biceps & mid-triceps, pecs, stomach, pubes, thighs, calves, feet and toes were all covered in dark brown hair! His butt and back were hairless for some reason, but he thought that was because of his dislike for that. It really seemed as though the ointment catered to only what the individual likes and excludes dislikes. The next big startle came as he began to speak, wanting to hear his own voice. That too was different, manly and powerful. He spoke with a deep, baritone voice that was perfect for his new body. One thing that was a bit odd was that he noticed his bicupids were slightly longer and sharper than he ever noticed. Wanting to inspect that change further, he put one of his fingers up at the tooth and felt around. Finding that they were his and not some joke his brother could have played, he felt the very sharp tip, pricking his finger. Bobby winced slightly, but sucked on his finger to stop the bleeding. For some reason, the taste of the blood was sweet and filled with a new and more exotic flavor he never tasted before.</br>
<br>Something in him wanted to taste more, which he found to be odd, but not out of the question. Bobby bit down on his opened finger hard, this time piercing his finger with his tooth, allowing the blood to flow freely over his ivory teeth and onto his tongue.</br>
<br>Suddenly, Bobby began to feel weird, more primal... like that of a wolf. Pain began to rack through his body, overtaking all of his other senses. Bobby dropped to the floor in agony, unable to stand from it's severity. Bones began cracking and popping, muscles spasming, and his skin itching feverently. Bobby yelled out in pain, screaming from never feeling anything like that before. His screams became hoarse from the volume, then cracked. He yelled out this time, hoping to be able to make a cry, as if it helped his body cope with the feelings it was being overran by. When Bobby yelled out again, it was not a scream nor a yell, but a howl! Bobby's eyes widened, realizing he just howled like a true wolf! Pain overtook him again, his body convulsing on the floor beneath him. His head began to ache, his face pushing out into a muzzle with his nose following and turning into a wolf's nose. Bobby opened his eyes, wanting to see what was happening to him further. He managed to gain control of his hands and saw that they were still hands, but wolven hands with paw pads, gnarled knuckles and black claws. He looked down at his feet, seeing the same thing. The pain finally subsiding, Bobby rose to his feet and began to survey himself, but that idea was soon squashed flat by more pain, but in a localized area. His butt hurt bad, but only at the end of his tail bone, when a huge wolven and fluffy tail jutted forward, which also released him from his pain completely. Curious to see how he looked, face and all, Bobby turned and faced the mirror. Now not only did a 35 year old person stare back at himself in disbelief, but now ontop of it... he was a 35 year old, dark brown, hugely muscled WEREWOLF that was still wearing his human shorts, with his tail sticking awkwardly out from the waist band.</br>
<br>Bobby stood there for a second, taking the time to admire his even newer body, thinking to himself <i>Well... I always thought about how cool it would be to be a werewolf. The ointment must have tapped into that thought as well.</i></br>
<br>Once he was finished with himself, he turned to face the new room in his new werewolf body.</br>
<br>Stepping out of the closet, he surveyed the room, noticing that many things were different other than the contents and the structure of the room itself, but what did he see?</br></p>
