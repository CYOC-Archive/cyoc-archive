<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve’s owner carried him to the birthing center’s entryway, revealing that the interior of the building was much different than it had been before.  Instead of being a single open room, there was now a hallway that broke off into what were presumably birthing rooms on either side.  Steve counted four in the front part of the hall, but beyond those the hallway split into right and left sided paths that Steve couldn’t see down.<br />
<br />
The hallway was made out of cheap looking linoleum and lit by florescent lighting.  It all spoke of building made by the absolute lowest bidder using the cheapest materials for the job.  Still, it looked clean and sterile which, Steve realized, made sense since whoever owned this place probably didn’t want their slaves dying in birth.<br />
<br />
A few more steps and Leon opened the first door on the right, which led into what was very obviously a room made to accommodate a laboring woman.  In the center of the room was a birthing bed and, on top of that, with her legs spread as wide as she could get them, was Austin, the panting anthro bitch.  From Austin’s distinct silence, Steve guessed that she was probably in between contractions.  <br />
<br />
Next to the table was a bunch of equipment, all connected to Austin by innumerable wires.  From the look of it, Steve guessed that the machinery was monitoring Austin’s vitals but, beyond recognizing the telltale images and beeping of the heartbeat monitor, Steve couldn’t make out what any of the lines on the other displays said.<br />
<br />
Standing beside to the bed were three very female and very identical rabbits with noticeably pregnant bellies.  Each of them was dressed in what would have been a very stereotypical nursing gown, were it not for the hole in the front of their garments allowing their pregnant stomachs to hang out.  Behind them was the only male besides Leon in the room – a rather short otter who was dressed in a doctor’s uniform with a stethoscope wrapped around his neck.<br />
<br />
Sitting on benches along the edges of the room were the rest of the anthros.  Like Steve, they were all wearing nothing more than a slave collar and all but the hen looked very pregnant.<br />
<br />
The anthro hen from earlier was panting as she sat as far as she could get from the egg that was now resting on the ground in the center of the room.  She was leaning back in into the bench, which meant that her crotch was facing straight towards the door.  Steve had expected that her vagina would still be gaping open from the egg she’d pushed out just minutes earlier, but it had tightened back up to the point that it wasn’t even visible through her white feathers.<br />
<br />
Steve briefly wondered why the hen was sitting in such a weird position until he saw her using the wing-stubs that had replaced her hands to rub a belly that had already begun expanding again.  She’d kept looking down at the belly, before closing her eyes and shaking her head as if to say, “no more eggs.”  Then, as if she couldn’t quite comprehend the reality of her situation, she’d look back at her stomach and start the process all over again.<br />
<br />
To Steve’s right was a very short, petite mouse woman covered in light beige fur.  Multiple rows of small breasts ran down torso, each of which was decked with a thin but erect teat.  The most notable thing about her was that unlike Steve, whose breasts stopped right at the border of his pregnant belly, the mouse’s breasts continued on top of hers and ran all the way down to her crotch.<br />
<br />
The mouse girl was just staring off with a dazed look on her face, while the anthro fox next to her wrapped an arm around her shoulder.  The fox girl was leaning into the mouse’s ear, and Steve could hear her repeatedly whispering, “It’s going to be ok, Matt.  It’s going to be ok.” <br />
<br />
The fox girl looked to be about the same size as Steve, which meant that she towered over her apparent friend, the mouse girl.  But other than the fact that her fur was the same brilliant crimson color as the much more feral vixen from earlier, the only notable thing about the fox was that she also was sporting a similar set of six lactating breasts as Steve, despite her more reasonably sized albeit heavily pregnant belly.<br />
<br />
On the right side of the room, sitting up against what used to be the center’s plate glass window, was an anthro doe with two modestly sized breasts hanging off of her chest, but it wasn’t those breasts that was occupying the doe’s attention.  Rather, her hands were currently playing with the pair of swollen, black, animalistic looking udders that were sandwiched between her thighs and belly.<br />
<br />
The final anthro that Steve could see was an alligator who was laying on a bench on the left side of the room.  From the look of it, the thick, scaly tail coming out of the alligators backside, combined with the bulbous belly and two massive breasts on her front side had probably prevented her from being able to sit in any other position.  <br />
<br />
Unlike the Steve and the females in the room, the alligator’s body was huge – equal to if not bigger than the lion who was holding onto Steve.  The breasts were also a surprise, especially since the hen didn’t have any.  As Steve looked at the black nipples that sat atop a checkerboard of green scales, he once again had a vague sense of déjà vu.  It was like he had seen her before…<br />
<br />
Steve didn’t want to dwell on it and noticed that, as far as the pregnant women were concerned, all save the hen were in the same boat that Steve was.  While none of them were in labor just yet, they were all very clearly at full term and ready to pop, though there was a significant disparity in the actual size of their bellies.  <br />
<br />
The mouse had the smallest bump underneath her stomach, which was no doubt a biologically necessary consequence of the positioning on the breasts running down her body – if her womb carried too big a baby, then it was entirely possible that the weight of her breasts would be too much for her skin to hold.<br />
<br />
The doe’s stomach looked relatively normal for a woman who was nine months pregnant, while the others were clearly more oversized.  Unfortunately for Steve, he soon realized that if he and the oth… the women in the room all competed in a belly size contest, it would be *his* belly that ended up taking home the gold.<br />
<br />
That just left the cow and perhaps one other person, both of whom were absent from the room.  Based on where the cow had fallen earlier, Steve guessed that she was probably in one of the rooms on the left side of the hall.  <br />
<br />
Steve knew that the other missing person likely hadn’t been spared a birth filled fate.  Rather, that man turned anthro was probably the cow’s friend who, as the building had shifted, ran to help the cow, only to find their gender inverted as fur grew out of their skin and their new womb prepared to force them into experiencing the dubious ‘joy’ of motherhood.</p>
