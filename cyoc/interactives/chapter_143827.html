<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason tried to call his best friend, Richard for help, but he couldn&#39;t reach him. Jason was starting to worry about his life now. What if he never got his dad back? Not only for his sake, Johnny needed their dad back too.<br />
<br />
Their mother, Christine, needed a husband even more. Having gone from a happily-married wife with two sons to a single mother of four was not a good change for her. So, it didn&#39;t take long for Jason to decide.<br />
<br />
Getting Damien and Neil into his bedroom, Jason said, &quot;Ok, this has been an interesting experiment, but I think we should put you two back together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean going back with Mr. Stick-in-the-Mud?&quot; scoffed Damien, &quot;Like I would want to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not an ideal partner either,&quot; said Neil, &quot;You&#39;re so reckless and you don&#39;t care what your actions cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you wanted to merge back with him,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I should, but...&quot; started Neil.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s too vain to want to merge back,&quot; said Damien, &quot;He likes being younger and fit. And I agree with him. I really let myself go when I got old.&quot; He flexed his muscles, which were easier to see when he was in his swim trunks.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t about you guys,&quot; said Jason, &quot;You know how Mom is now. She can&#39;t care for all four of us, not without a husband. And you guys need to be her husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is true,&quot; said Neil, &quot;This has been fun, but we need to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, already? At least tell me we&#39;ll be going to the movies next weekend like we said,&quot; said Damien.<br />
<br />
&quot;What movies?&quot; asked Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since we&#39;re younger, we get a discount at the movie theater,&quot; said Neil, &quot;I suppose we could just split again later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason sighed and said, &quot;You know, if you guys are going to be splitting regularly, then Mom has to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; snapped Damien and Neil.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be fair if she&#39;s the only one in our family not to know. And she needs to know she&#39;ll be having her husband return,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she won&#39;t let us split or you fuse,&quot; said Damien.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Mom&#39;s more open-minded than that,&quot; said Jason, &quot;Either way, you know she deserves better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess we have to become Daniel again,&quot; said Neil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we at least take one last swim?&quot; asked Damien.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but we&#39;re not holding this off forever,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
But as they were having their swim in the pool, Damien had been thinking. Being merged with Neil didn&#39;t really appeal to him at all. Especially if it meant becoming a middle-aged man who let his body go. But despite his more free-spirited nature, he did still love Catherine. But why should he have to give up his new found youth? <br />
<br />
Sometime later, after dinner was finished, Jason said to his mother, &quot;Mom, you remember Damien and Neil&#39;s dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Christine sighed and said, &quot;I don&#39;t really want to talk about it. I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be any better for you than your own dad was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, what if I told you they were one and the same?&quot; asked Jason.<br />
<br />
Christine scoffed and said, &quot;I think I would have known if I married the same guy I met in college. I mean, they did look a bit alike, but they couldn&#39;t be the same person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were, they&#39;re not as you really remember them,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; asked his mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, about a week ago, I got these magic cuffs that can fuse people together,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really?&quot; asked his mom, said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but today, Dad, my real dad, found them and he split himself in two. They&#39;re Damien and Neil now,&quot; said Jason.<br />
<br />
Christine looked at her older twins and said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s certainly an imaginative story. Is this for English class?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s real, Mom,&quot; said Jason, &quot;Look, we just put one cuff on Damien here.&quot; He snapped the cuff onto Damien&#39;s wrist. &quot;And then we put the other cuff on Neil to get Dad back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason placed the cuff on Neil.<br />
<br />
 Nothing happened.<br />
 <br />
Neil and Jason looked at each other curiously. They hadn&#39;t messed anything up. But why wasn&#39;t Neil glowing or turning into a blob?<br />
<br />
Jason felt someone grab his arm and turned in time to see Damien place his cuff on his arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damien, what did you do!&quot; was all Neil could yell, before both their bodies became glowing blobs. Neil&#39;s blob crashed down on top of Jason&#39;s. Then they melted into each other before surging up in a combined mass. Just like in the cabin the clothes each boy had been wearing burned away. <br />
<br />
 The combined mass grew until it reached 6&#39;3,&quot; its glow dying down, before solidifying into a new man. Jason and Neil being 15 and 19 became 34, four years younger than Daniel. He was also in better shape and leaner than Daniel had been. His features looked more like a model-esque version of Daniel. His new cock formed and was obviously very large. The new man blinked as his new mind assembled himself. He was now Neison, a kind and gentle, yet no nonsense man.<br />
<br />
Neison looked over at Christine, whose face was bright red. New memories were springing into Neison&#39;s head, of Christine being his wife. Damien was had always been a little trouble make since he hit his teens. Several new memories bubbled up, of the wedding, their honeymoon, making love, the conception and birth of Johnny, now his own son, and several years of raising his son and stepson.<br />
<br />
But deep down inside he knew it wasn’t true. He was also Jason who had just been forcibly merged with a part of his dad.<br />
<br />
Johnny was the first to so speak. &quot;Jason?&quot;  The 9-year-old was worried. His brother had looked petrified before he became a blob.<br />
<br />
The question snapped everyone out of their state of shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go,” Christine got up and started to leave the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; asked Neison, with his new deep voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know what I just saw. I need to think it over...&quot; said Christine before walking outside and driving away in her car.<br />
<br />
Neison glared at Damien and said, &quot;What the hell was that supposed to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As if Neil and I fusing back into Daniel would have been less shocking,&quot; said Damien smug.<br />
<br />
&quot; Daniel&#39;s supposed to be here not me,&quot; said Neison.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, you can separate later,&quot; said Damien, &quot;just...take a little more time and enjoy your existence.&quot; <br />
<br />
Neison rolled his eyes and said, &quot; Well, it&#39;s not like she&#39;s coming back soon. So, I might as well enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Damien exited the room.<br />
<br />
Johnny came up beside and tapped Neison on his leg.  The kid looked like he was about to cry. <br />
<br />
Neison bent down and spoke to eye level with Johnny. &quot;Hey little, man Jason&#39;s going to be okay. I&#39;m going to keep him safe. Then when your mom comes back will try to get your family back to the way it&#39;s supposed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
He rubbed Johnny&#39;s head then held up his hand for a high five &quot;You with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny high fived him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now let me go put on some clothes.&quot;</p>
