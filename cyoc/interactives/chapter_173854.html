<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Organ music filled the room and the two giants embraced. Jeff felt this the most as his entire body was squished against the boxers in front of him as his owner&#39;s crotch pressed against the bride&#39;s thigh. Jeff&#39;s body flattened and he realized just how strange it was to be a creature made of flesh but no bones. His body deformed itself but it was not really painful. But it was still surprising and he mentally yelled out in shock.<br />
<br />
He was equally surprised to hear a reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff!&quot; cried Jenny, somehow communicating without speaking. &quot;Jeff! I think I can hear you because our owners are touching!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, Jenny! I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here. I think we just got married!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they did,&quot; said Jenny. &quot;You and I are just...&quot; and with that her connection with Jeff was lost as their hosts separated and ended their hug. They continued holding hands which allowed Jenny to sense Jeff&#39;s presence, but the connection wasn&#39;t strong enough to speak directly with him.<br />
<br />
Just then, the bride and groom dashed down the aisle which created a truly terrifying adventure for both of their unwilling passengers. Jeff flopped and flailed about in his dark prison, bouncing off both legs as if he were a tennis ball. Speaking of balls, he felt his own jumping around and the man made large strides. Jeff was completely out of control and all he could do was experience the violent motions.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jenny was getting a better view than ever. The woman&#39;s labia stretched open each time she extended a leg forward and Jenny was able to watch the high heels stomp their way up the red carpeting. She felt the bouncing of her owner&#39;s torso, but her movements were not nearly as intense as what Jeff was experiencing. She was surprised by how easily she could see through the underwear until she realized what that meant. The panties weren&#39;t designed for her to see out. They were sheer and translucent specifically so SHE could be seen later tonight.<br />
<br />
For a moment she was frightened by the idea of another man sticking his penis into her body, but she quickly remembered that this really meant she would be reunited with Jeff. Jenny started to feel better right as the bride sat down in the back of a car and crossed her legs. Jenny&#39;s view disappeared and she waited in darkness.<br />
<br />
The reception passed slowly for Jeff and Jenny. They heard muffled noises and voices that were drowned out by loud music. Often their owners would hit the dance floor, once again causing Jeff to flop about mercilessly. The bride and groom held hands a lot, but never long enough for Jeff and Jenny to really communicate. Jenny passed the time by admiring other people&#39;s shoes as they talked to the bride. She wondered if she&#39;d ever be able to wear shoes again; if she&#39;d ever go back to having feet. She didn&#39;t know how the Chronivac had malfunctioned so she had no idea if this situation would fix itself or not.<br />
<br />
Jeff had started the evening being bored, but he eventually began to notice minor fluctuations in his own blood flow. He would become partially erect and then deflate again. After a little bit of concentration, Jeff discovered that he would feel the cause of each change, even though he couldn&#39;t see anything.<br />
<br />
Bridesmaid&#39;s cleavage: stiffen<br />
Mother in law: deflate<br />
Bride smiling: stiffen<br />
Buffet line: deflate<br />
<br />
Jeff hadn&#39;t realized just how busy a cock kept itself. Nearly everything this dude looked at elicited some response from him. Whether pro or con, he still had to react. It was a lot of work, but it was better than doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Jenny, meanwhile, was noticing a similar phenomenon. Her bride had been cruising along at a consistent level of mild arousal the whole night. And every time her new husband touched her, it spiked. Jenny quickly figured out that each spike created a tiny bit of warm wetness deep inside her vaginal body. At first it was no big deal, but it was starting to build up. Finally, a slow dance ended, the groom kissed the bride, and the resulting flood overwhelmed Jenny&#39;s efforts. She quivered, her lips parted, and she watched as a drop of lubrication slipped out of her and darkened her owner&#39;s panties.<br />
<br />
Jenny felt ashamed but was able to feel her owner&#39;s emotions. The bride was loving it! She knew her panties were getting wet and she also knew her huge dress would keep anyone from seeing it. The bride enjoyed the sensations and Jenny decided it was ok to follow her lead. She let a little more juice leak out on purpose. The bride squeezed her thighs together, squishing Jenny. She lost sight of the floor and the shoes, and even the panties. She enjoyed the warm hug the legs were providing her.<br />
<br />
When the bride unclenched, Jenny was surprised to see 8 pink shoes in her vision. The bride had gathered her bridesmaids. They were talking, but Jenny couldn&#39;t hear. Suddenly, they all began walking in single direction. What was going on? They were leaving the reception but Jenny couldn&#39;t tell where they were going.<br />
<br />
Finally, the bride&#39;s enormous feet transitioned from carpet to white, florescent-lit tiles. Jenny heard echos and running water. The bridesmaids&#39; shoes all clomped loudly as they left the carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re in the bathroom,&quot; thought Jenny. The bride stopped walking, turned around, and her friend&#39;s helped her lift her dress up. It was only then, as the bride lowered her rear end onto the toilet, that Jenny realized the full ramifications of her situation. They weren&#39;t just in the bathroom for no reason. The bride needed to pee. And that meant JENNY was going to have to pee FOR her.<br />
<br />
Jenny yelled out mentally but, of course, no one could hear her. She tried to stop what was happening, but the bride was in control. She relaxed and Jenny felt herself loosen up. As the stream began to flow, Jenny could only ruefully hope that Jeff was having more fun than she was right now.</p>
