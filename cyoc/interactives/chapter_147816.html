<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The days following the attack were chaotic to say the least. The healers were overwhelmed with wounded with more being discovered as people shifted through debris or were attacked by stragglers that had survived. Any able bodied adventurers were drafted to help hunt down the surviving monsters. Some protested to this and wanted to capture the monsters alive to try to study and possibly reverse whatever had transformed them. Ultimately it came down to whether or not the creature could be captured successfully, with most fighting to the death in a frenzy. However there were a few captured alive and sent off to be studied. By the 3rd day after the attack, no more monsters were spotted and the people could focus on other issues.<br />
<br />
The city watch was the first that the people began to turn to for answers. Why wasn&#39;t the watch aware of the situation and why couldn&#39;t they protect the people they were supposed to? To alleviate the people&#39;s concerns, the watch was to stand down and wait for an investigation. Meanwhile, the Paladin orders were to pick up the slack and act as temporary guards.<br />
<br />
But it wasn&#39;t all bad news. Nearly a week after the incident, an awards ceremony was held to honor those that showed exceptional performance during the battle. Jack was awarded for organizing the defense at the Colosseum and protecting the citizens. A few others were also awarded; a shop keeper named Alyvia for offering shelter in her shop and keeping the monsters at bay, a trio of students from the fighters school for keeping the horde from swarming down a densely populated street, a few dozen for keeping the gigantic hydra from advancing further into the city. It was when Duinir was called forth that Vect straightened up. The Elf leaned heavily on his cane as he walked to the official handing out the awards. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why is he still in such bad shape,&quot; Sara whispered to Vect, &quot;shouldn&#39;t he have gotten treatment for those injuries by now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vect shook his head in silence, not knowing the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;For bravery in the field of battle, the slaying of a dreaded Lindworm-,&quot; at the name of the monster Sara felt Vect tense up next to her, Sara glanced at him and saw his body was trembling slightly. Sara laid one hand on Vect&#39;s and gave it a gentle squeeze. Vect gave her a halfhearted smile to show his appreciation, but she could tell something really bothered him. The rest of the ceremony concluded and Vect left to try and find Duinir. Sara watched him disappear into the crowd and then followed Jack, Beverly, and Lelu back to the Inn.<br />
<br />
At their suite in the Sleeping Drake Inn, the group listened to the announcer over the room&#39;s crystal ball. The small smoke filled orb allowed the room&#39;s occupants to listen to the news that was being broadcast from the High Council. <br />
The female voice continued to read off the decisions and events of the day, &quot;...And it has been recommended that any members attending the adventurers schools are to return home for the next few months or establish long term lodging while the situation in the capital has stabilized and training is allowed to continue. Discussions to rebuild on the area now named the scorched district are...&quot; Beverly tapped one of the glowing runes on the base that supported the ball to end the magic and silence the news. <br />
&quot;So that&#39;s it then,&quot; Beverly scowled. &quot;We just pack up and head home after this like nothing happened. Like we didn&#39;t just fight off an invasion and pretend it&#39;s just like an early summer break.&quot; She folded her arms, and one of her fore hooves tapped on the hardwood floor absently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful Bev. You might break through the floor if you do that too hard,&quot; Jack warned, his eyes never leaving the medallion he was dangling in front of his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Beverly lowered her head and sighed. &quot;I&#39;m just so frustrated that this could happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You, me, and half the city,&quot; Sara slouched on the couch, her tail draped over her lap. <br />
<br />
&quot;And the other half wants to stir up more conflict,&quot; Vect sighed as he opened the door and entered the room. Vect&#39;s hair was still wet from sweat and his clothing was still showing some damp patches, he looked exhausted. He closed the door behind him and leaned against it, his eyes shut. Beverly started toward him, but Vect held up a hand to stop her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get to talk with him,&quot; Jack asked, setting the medallion down on the table next to him.<br />
<br />
Vect shook his head and finally opened his eyes. Sara saw they were red from tears. &quot;Lost him in the crowd. Been running everywhere trying to find him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on with Duinir,&quot; Sara asked.<br />
<br />
Lelu was first to answer with a question. &quot;Do you know what a lindworm is?&quot; Sara shook her head, as did Beverly. &quot;Its a cousin of sorts to dragons and wyverns, but much rarer. Basically they look like a horned snake with 2 arms. They have a fire breath attack, but can&#39;t fly.&quot; Sara and Beverly nodded to show they were still following. Lelu dropped her gaze to the floor before continuing. &quot;The biggest difference between a lindworm and a dragon is what happens when one is slain. When a dragon is slain nothing happens. You get the gold and the trophies and the glory, end of story. When a lindworm is slain...&quot; She paused.<br />
<br />
Jack continued for her. &quot;When a lindworm is slain the one that delivered the final blow is met with a terrible curse. This can range from an extreme sensitivity to cold or heat, to  insanity. But seeing Duinir still so bandaged up he could be under the effect of one of two possible curses that have been documented. The first possible one prevents healing magic from working on you and you take even longer to heal naturally. A simple bruise can become a serious problem if not taken care of. This is the lesser of the 2 curses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the other one,&quot; Sara asked, her hands gripped her tail tightly in anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;452,&quot; Vect said wearily causing everyone to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The average age an elf dies naturally, Sara,&quot; Vect pushed away from the door and slumped down into a chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;The worst possible curse is the time curse. The afflicted ages 1 year each day until they finally die from old age,&quot; Lelu finished. &quot;It is a slayer&#39;s worst nightmare to fight a lindworm. Some volunteer to slay one or several if they are suicidal or want to redeem themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-well how old is Duinir?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;124. He&#39;ll be an old man this time next year...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t there some way to remove the curse,&quot; Beverly began. &quot;I&#39;m sure the. Healers have something that can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He would have been cured before the ceremony today if it was possible,&quot; Vect shook his head. &quot;I have a feeling that its death curse is unable to be cured by any way the healers have available.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So then we search for it ourselves,&quot; Sara crossed her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could take years just to find a possible lead. Duinir has months to a year at best,&quot; Jack stated. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I think I need some sleep,&quot; Vect pushed up from the chair and disappeared into his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just another one to the list,&quot; Jack winced as he got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Beverly looked at Jack in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another one to add to the list of people that have died from this attack,&quot; Jack massaged his shoulder to relieve some of the pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still hurting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Picked up some numbing salve the other day that&#39;s helping some.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why haven&#39;t you seen a proper healer yet,&quot; Lelu scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re too busy with real patients to worry about me. I&#39;ll talk to me village cleric when I get back home next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re leaving?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I feel need to see my home again for a while. See the family and things,&quot;  he went to shrug but stopped at the tension in his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going home could do us some good. We&#39;ll be back here in a few months anyway to return to adventurers training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...right,&quot; Sara thought of what returning home for her would mean exactly.</p>
