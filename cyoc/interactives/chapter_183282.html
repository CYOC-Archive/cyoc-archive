<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">New England. That is the feeling you got from the grey skies and low rolling hills. You were somewhere in New England, maybe upstate New York or possibly Canada, and, thankfully, it must have been early summer; plenty of sun and breeze and endless greenery to hide your shame. <br />
<br />
As you thought about that you cast your mind back onto the fidgeting creature on your back. It was starting to annoy you, so you whinnied.<br />
<br />
“I know, I know,” Jess said, battling her straps again “I’m sorry, it&#39;s just, ugh.” You felt her flop into you, starting to slip off your back. “It&#39;s like this thing is glued together.”<br />
<br />
Falling off a horse seemed like a bad idea, so you came to a stop. That only made things worse, Jess eeping as she slid off your saddle, holding on to one of your own straps. <br />
<br />
“Little help?” She said. You carefully moved to a grassy knoll and keeled on it, letting her slip off from a safer height. She hit the ground with another eep, and an oof, untangling herself from you. With her off you, however, you kicked back onto your hooves and trotted away.<br />
<br />
Despite the ridiculous getup of constraining leather straps you couldn’t help but feel liberated, moving with ease, no Vicky staring at you, no lust clouding your mind, and no litteral burden to carry. Still, it felt very strange moving on all fours, and you still couldn’t shake the feeling that you were more of an abnormally functioning human than a fully-functioning horse. This was made all the more real by the unignorable metal bar sitting in your mouth.<br />
<br />
“This fucking thing,” Jess grunted. You turned back to find her kneeling, her back to you, clasping at the back of her leather binds. The tight leathers left little to the imagination, the lines and openings highlighting her form, the ridges of her backbones just visible. You didn’t need to be male, human, or in heat to appreciate how attractive she was. “I think they are stuck on, can you pull them off?”<br />
<br />
You moved in, yanking at the back straps with your teeth to no avail. You could taste Jess’s sweat on the straps, and feel the thump of her heart through her back. <br />
<br />
“Okay, okay, easy Princess,” She said. The name stung, and as she turned to see the pain written on your face. Her eyes lingered, before she shook her head. <br />
<br />
“You are, er, Princess. God, why can’t I say your real name?” She shook her head, patting your cheek. “I… don’t think I can remember it, can you?”<br />
<br />
You searched your thoughts for a moment, but it was true. Even when you focused on the clearest memories of the before times, when you knew your name was said, it was like there was an absence, a hole in the story. Your mom calling you for dinner, the register at school, a doctors appointment, you and Jess in the throes of passion: you remembered each one vividly, and yet it was like your name was never there.<br />
<br />
You shook your head, trotting away amid a torrent of thoughts.<br />
<br />
You remembered being there with Jess, not two weeks ago, in your little bedroom in your little house share. You remembered her beneath you, her face bright red, gyrating their hips with your thrusts, mumbling your name, but the world itself was formless, like her mouth sealed shut or blurred as she spoke. You tried to focus, tried to get just a syllable, a letter, but it was no good.<br />
<br />
You snapped back from the memory, suddenly realizing you were stood there, no longer able to hold her waist or fuck her silly. Hell, you could no longer hold anything.<br />
<br />
You looked at the leather around your leg, the hoove at the bottom so alien yet so yours. You wanted to barf, but could you even do that anymore.<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Jess said, patting the grass beside her. She had a reassuring smile on her face, her head on her knees. With a small neight you began trotting over, unable to mask your sadness. <br />
<br />
“This isn’t over,” Jess said, a hand on your mane as you settled beside her. You were careful not to crush her, lowering into a folded kneel-sit. “We will find a way to get these things off and turn human again, I promise.” <br />
<br />
You snorted a passive noise, as things went very quiet. It was clear Jess didn’t know what to do, though nor did you for that matter. Were you human you might have laid across her lap.<br />
<br />
“You know, it&#39;s silly, but wanna know the worst part about this outfit?” You nodded. “When it attached to me I had just transformed back, and I had actually transformed back into the dress I was wearing the day I… Or I guess we changed, and it tore it up in the proccess. I was so pissed. It was such a nice dress, remember it?”<br />
<br />
Remember it, yeah, you bought it for her, you thought. But, as you tried to express that she laughed and began petting your nose.<br />
<br />
“You should, you bought it after all.” Your heart leapt. At least that memory was unaltered. “It was that thrift shop when we were down in Atlanta. I was trying things on and showing them to you, but that one was much sluttier than it looked on the rack, so I was gonna put it back. I came out in it and you were all like ‘well, uh, I kinda like it.’ Like I didn’t know, trying to be smooth.” <br />
<br />
You snorted again, bashing her with the side of your head, not enough to hurt, but enough to push her over, as she laughed and laughed, patting your head. <br />
<br />
“Thing was like a boob rack,” she laughed, as you tried to smother her still with your massive head. “‘Look, here are my tits, ignore the yellow bed sheet they are attached to.’” She added as she backed away, puffing out her chest. “In fact, wanna see how silly this outfit is?” She continued, rising to her feet. Without warning she yanked the bikini top loose, her tits billowing out. “I can get my tits out, but the rest of me is frozen in!”<br />
<br />
You didn’t need to be male, human, or in heat to appreciate how attractive she was, and at that moment she looked more attractive than you ever remembered. No matter how many times you saw them her tits were always perfect to you, and the outfit made it all the more worse. With the bra removed you could see the boob-window was actually heart-shaped, matching an inverted heart on the crotch window. <br />
<br />
You only stared at her crotch for a moment, but you didn&#39;t need to look at it too long to realize something. Her cock, her new cock, was starting to become erect.<br />
<br />
“Maybe we should head on?” Jess said as she reattached the bra, aparently unaware of your stares, or her growing errection. “We are only a couple hours out from the stables, I want to be as far away from them by nightfall, ideally in a police station filing a report. That said, it might be better if we find a clear stream and something to eat, and carry on to town tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
She stood there, still trying to hide her modesty but trying to be natural about it. You tried to maintain eye-contact, not stare at ‘him’ as you thought about what you might like to do.</p>
