<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You spend the first twenty minutes after you woke up making coffee, waiting for the coffee, then drinking the coffee while standing naked in the kitchen. Breasts are great. You have always been quite fond of losing your self, gazing into another woman&#39;s chest, mostly from afar or across a conference room table. The coffee is hot, and it doesn&#39;t feel like your dreaming. You take a few pinches, and then a few moments rolling your thick nipples between your thumb and forefinger, stopping when you feel the slickness of arousal between your legs. &quot;I don&#39;t think I am dreaming,&quot; you say aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your going to be late if you keep that up,&quot; says Muffin, now standing by the refrigerator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea...about that. I appreciate the body you and Candy have me in. I would like to go to work in my former body,&quot; you state.<br />
<br />
Muffin points to a handbag on the bar, and you could swear that was not there two seconds ago. &quot;Check out the wallet inside,&quot; Muffin says as she wags her furry fingers at the hand bag.<br />
<br />
Your shoulders slump and you pull the handbag over, opening it up, then removing the wallet. Inside you see your new drives license, sighing deeply, &quot;Other than the photo, the only other change is gender,&quot; you comment flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. You have a 8 mile bike ride and no squishy scrotum to tug and get in your way. Try it just for a day?&quot; asks Muffin.<br />
<br />
You put the wallet back in the handbag, and Muffin reaches out for your hand, and leads you back into your bedroom, then into the shower. You spend the next few minutes with Muffin as she helps you shower quickly before kicking you out to a waiting Candy, who has already picked out your wardrobe for the day. A soaked Muffin, wrapped in several towels, watches from the bathroom doorway as Candy does her best to get you dried off and dressed.<br />
<br />
Candy firmly states, &quot;This is what you like. You cannot tell me different, your thoughts betray you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You add, &quot;True, but I am going to work, there is a dress code. Business casual. Underwear would be nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy laughs, &quot;That receptionist in sales shows more skin than this. You don&#39;t need underwear unless you take the skirt option.&quot;<br />
<br />
You cannot argue, but the rumor is that she is also sleeping with the VP of Sales. &quot;Fine. No skirt. Let&#39;s pack that, and I&#39;ll wear that today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy packs your work clothes in the backpack you wear when cycling to work, then brings you a shiny skinsuit, &quot;This will both flatter and keep you dry and comfortable. Just take it slow putting it on. No bra or underwear needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
You take the skinsuit and start to put it on, then Candy steps in to help you with tugging it up your legs and over your thunder thighs and large buttocks. Candy helps you slide your hands and arms in the very tight sleeves as you hold the neck cuff  and Candy zips you up in the back. You step over to the bathroom doorway to look in the mirror above the sink. &quot;What the fuck is this?&quot; you blurt out in surprise.<br />
<br />
Candy smiles as she sticks her head in the doorway, &quot;You have the body of an elite cyclist. This is how you see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not the body I woke up with,&quot; you protest.<br />
<br />
Candy giggles, &quot;That&#39;s right, this is better. You wanted to be more than eye candy, so now you have a body built for performance too. It&#39;s all muscle. Don&#39;t worry about the super glossy white fabric, it dries faster than you can sweat.&quot;<br />
<br />
You purse your lips tightly together, unhappy that Candy is right and that you have nothing further to argue.  The skinsuit has excellent compression in your thighs, stomach, and chest. Your supersized butt and tights look out of place on the small female frame you woke up with. You never had a fantasy where a woman as good looking as you would be in your bedroom, now...your that woman. Staring in the mirror increases your arousal, to the point you know your wet down there. You move your hand down and stroke the fabric over your vagina, and it&#39;s dry. Candy pulls you back from the doorway. Feeling guilty, you step over and sit on the bed, &quot;Shoes?,&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Candy hands you a pair of cycling shoes for your bike to clip onto the pedals. Candy strokes your shoulder softly, &quot;The suit will also not get wet in the rain, like I said, it dries fast. And don&#39;t worry about any smell, the fabric will take care of that. I knew you would like how you look.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slide on and tie the special shoes with clips for your bike, and stand up. &quot;I have no complaints. I just want to be sure I don&#39;t forget who I am in all this. Just when I think I want to stop and go no further....something happens and I find myself further down this Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole,&quot; you admit to yourself aloud.<br />
<br />
Muffin steps over, now dry, and gives your ample buttocks a firm squeeze, &quot;If your happy, we are happy. You can undo or go back to any point at any time. Your word is final. Just know that Candy and I will always be there and working to fulfill your full potential.&quot; Muffin and Candy take turns giving you a gentle otter kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
You take the backpack from Candy and on the way to the garage, pick up your handbag, stuffing it in the backpack too. Stepping into the garage, you find there are three high end bicycles. That&#39;s when you turn around and find Candy and Muffin, in human form, wearing the same skinsuit as you. &quot;Ummmmm.....wow,&quot; is all you can say as the two very fit and curvy women look like they could pop out of their skinsuits at any moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your lust for women is safe with us,&quot; brags a very sultry looking Candy. Every one of her curves from her breasts to her thighs accentuated by the shiny fabric. &quot;Thank you for the idea for cushion in the ass, it really fills out the body shape. You don&#39;t mind if we ride to work with you?&quot; asks Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Work...with me?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Muffin nods, &quot;Yes, your looking at Carol and Ariana, the new junior associates in IT.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok....where are you clothes to change into?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Candy walks up and puts her finger to your lips, and her finger goes from human to otter then back to human. &quot;We can do without those dear,&quot; she says, in a slow, sensual tone. Candy then smiles and kisses you square on the lips while reaching down to push the fabric of your skinsuit into your vaginal lips with the very same finger she touched your mouth with a moment ago. Breaking the kiss, Candy whispers, &quot;Enjoy today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy and Muffin mount up on their bikes and pedal to the end of the driveway, while you get on your bike and get the garage door closed. Together the three of you make the eight mile ride in just under twenty minutes, and arrive to your office fifteen minutes early. Today was going to be interesting. You didn&#39;t notice while riding, but when waiting to cross traffic or a red light, the attention was quick to come to the three of you. You took the attention as rather cold, as if those looking at you three were motivated only by carnal desires. It was not a good feeling. The office building had a bike rack by the security station under the building. It was there you three rode up just as your female riding partner was locking her bike, she waved, and you waved back and she walked off to the stairwell.<br />
<br />
Muffin locked her bike and nodded to Candy, who then both looked at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a mind reader, but yes. That&#39;s her,&quot; you confirm to your riding partners.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go change. We will see you at lunch if you want,&quot; Muffin proclaimed as she gave your giggly but a good swat with her gloved hand. The two of them follow behind you up the stairs, stifling their constant snickering until they get off on the second floor. You take the stairs to the fifth floor and head to the women&#39;s changing room, still wondering if this is real or dream. Your at work, with breasts and no underwear. It feels like a very wet dream or this is going to be a most interesting Monday.</p>
