<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Hannah came down from her magically induced lust, she scrambled to recover her clothes and get dressed. Standing next to whatever Mark had become made her feel small, scrawny, and inadequate. Her mind grappled with the fact that she had lusted for a man and practically pounced on him. Now that the magical compulsion was over, she found herself thirsty for the alien beauty standing before her. Fortunately, she was more in control now, and she was able to articulate some of the questions that flooded her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still Professor Rogers inside?&quot; she asked timidly.<br />
<br />
Mark gave a sultry laugh in her distinctively feminine voice. &quot;Do you mean &#39;Am I going to have my soul sucked or my flesh eaten by the monster before me?&#39; Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m still Mark Rogers, at least until I choose a new name for myself. I am pretty sure that I am not possessed by any ancient spirit, demon, or goddess. But I know things now that I did not before.&quot; She considered getting dressed since she saw that Hannah was still flustered by her appearance. But there was no chance that any of her old clothes would still fit, not even her straw hat. She noted without much surprise that the figurine had vanished from her shirt pocket.<br />
<br />
Hannah continued. &quot;So what exactly are you? Are you a demon? You look exactly like…&quot; She gestured towards Mark and then around at the frescoes.<br />
<br />
Mark closed her eyes and thought for a second, not really sure where the knowledge was coming from.  &quot;You are correct in that I have become the being you see on the walls here. More like her offspring, to be precise. And just as an angel is not the God who created him, I am not a demon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are a goddess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She had no name in human languages. They all called her &#39;Goddess.&#39; And I have become all that she was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah&#39;s mind kicked into high gear. &quot;She was the collaborator in creation, wasn&#39;t she? But she wanted nothing to do with the male divinity.&quot; Hannah gestured at the fresco with the lesbian orgy. &quot;She didn&#39;t need him. So he grew jealous and went to war with him. She lost.&quot; She sounded sad at that last thought.<br />
<br />
Mark smiled with satisfaction. &quot;You really are my brightest student, aren&#39;t you? Yes, she was neutralized and bound here. In the end, she gave up her existence, distilling her essence into an inert object to convince her enemies that she was no longer a threat. Her plan was to pounce into the first tomb robber to enter this place. But no-one dared disturb the cell of the Goddess. She was forgotten. In the end, the male divinity grew bored with his creation and faded from this universe. With him gone, she faded, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But she&#39;s back! If all of this is true, then you&#39;re God now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark chuckled. &quot;One thing at a time, please. I&#39;m still getting used to the fact that I have boobs and horns now. It&#39;s a lot to take in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can do anything! You can reshape the world! Religion actually has a point now. You can even restore her vision.&quot; She pointed at the image of the Demon Queen enthroned. &quot;These frescoes we&#39;re painted as a warning on the walls of a prison, but look at her kingdom. It&#39;s happy. Peaceful. Orderly. Sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark walked over the the fresco and traced her long-nailed finger over the image of herself. &quot;Tempting…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A world without men. A world of beautiful women, ready to serve you and each other. A world built around love, not the dictates of a patriarchal God.&quot; Hannah&#39;s voice had grown fervent. <br />
<br />
Mark arched an eyebrow in her direction. &quot;What do you want?&quot; <br />
<br />
Hannah spoke without hesitation. &quot;I want to be your disciple. I want you to change me into a form pleasing to you.&quot; She gestured towards the depiction of the orgy. &quot;Make me a vessel of your power.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark had to hand it to Hannah. She was abitious through and through. And she clearly wanted to get in on the ground floor of this world-changing moment, too. <br />
<br />
But deep inside, Mark was still Mark Rogers, and Professor Mark Rogers was a bit of an asshole. A more virtuous man might have resisted the temptation to abuse this power. Mark was not that man. And Hannah was telling her exactly what she needed to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about this? If I transform you, you will be mine, in body, mind, and soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark did not need to hear Hannah&#39;s answer. Her thoughts and emotions were transparent to the new goddess.  Hannah wanted power, and as a high priestess she would be second only to Mark. She wanted to turn the world into a lesbian paradise, and she knew that Mark would make that happen. And far beneath her surface thoughts, Mark could sense that Hannah craved being controlled and dominated by a more powerful being. She was a perfect follower.<br />
<br />
In the end, Mark had to do little more than intensify Hannah&#39;s existing desires. She actually went with happiness as her will became fully dedicated to serving her goddess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let us give you a body to match your new position, my priestess,&quot; Mark whispered in her ear.<br />
<br />
Hannah&#39;s clothes vanished into thin air, but now she stood there unashamed, letting Mark work on her as if she were a block of sculptor&#39;s clay. Her skin turned a shade of cornflower blue, with a darker shade in her lips and nipples. She gained a full foot in height, and her girlish figure sprouted womanly curves. Her breasts inflated until they were as magnificent as Mark&#39;s gravity-defying orbs. Hannah&#39;s face took on an otherworldly beauty suitable for a divine messenger. Only the faintest trace of her mousy features remained so that her own mother would have trouble recognizing her. Her mother might, however, worship her daughter&#39;s beauty, unmatched among mortals. Finally, two small black horns sprouted from her forehead and she gained a writhing tail not unlike Mark&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to earn your wings,&quot; Mark said with an indulgent smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would die for you,&quot; Hannah said earnestly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t think you will,&quot; Mark said. With that, she struck Hannah with a violent backhand blow. Hannah sailed through the frescoed plaster where it depicted the imprisoned goddess, driving her several inches in the the solid stone wall. Hannah gave a yelp of surprise as she impacted into the wall. But as she stood up, she discovered she was completely uninjured, with not a single strand of her long silken hair out of place.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t have my earthly representative getting hurt, or growing old, or getting sick, can we? You are now completely indestructible and immortal. You have physical gifts that defy the physical laws of this universe, and I&#39;ve granted you a few added surprises to help you spread the good news of my ascension.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I am now a goddess as well?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;To mortals, you are. But I am still infinitely more powerful than you can imagine. Do not forget that fundamental truth of existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I live by that truth, my goddess.&quot;</p>
