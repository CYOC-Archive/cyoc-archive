<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time seemed to stand still. You looked to Tulipelle and you saw a soft twinkle in her eyes, her hair framing her face in a way that was perfect. If you&#39;d met a human version of Tulipelle, you would have probably asked her out. Even in the back of your mind now, you could admit that Tulipelle was very beautiful, though at the same time you&#39;d been nervous because you were still adapting to being a fairy. You liked being able to fly, but you were still adjusting, and that had been why you hadn&#39;t said anything on Tulipelle&#39;s beauty. Her perfect face with eyes that twinkled. Part of your mind also honestly wondered if Tulipelle was interested in you, as you remembered seeing her blush about something, even when you were still a human male.<br />
<br />
But now, the two of you were fairies and standing in front of each other. And Tulipelle had promised to help you. First to help you get home and then after you ate fairy food and grew two blue colored butterfly wings to become a fairy, she promised to help you adapt. She really didn&#39;t have to do that in your mind. She could have easily left you to die in that cave, and yet she healed you and promised to help you. She didn&#39;t have to promise to help you. You couldn&#39;t even name ex-girlfriends that you&#39;d had on Earth that would have done anything remotely like what Tulipelle had done for you. And a good part of you wished you could have someone who would do that much for you in your life.<br />
<br />
And you and Tulipelle were there helping two of Tulipelle&#39;s friends pick out various things for their wedding, which ranged from dresses to food and helping them on their own path to their happily ever after. And Tulipelle even said that fairies liked romance. And a part of your mind did admit that you had some attraction to Tulipelle, mostly for her eyes and her personality. In fact, you felt you actually now had the body that your human mind would have found more attractive, not that Tulipelle wasn&#39;t sexy in her own right, but what drew you to her were her eyes and her personality. <br />
<br />
And here you were looking into her eyes as time seemed to stand still. They seemed to twinkle in the light coming from the lamps in Dandel&#39;s home. You watched as her wings slowly beat behind her, you barely noticed your own wings beating at the same rate. She was so beautiful to you and had been so helpful to you when she didn&#39;t have to be. You barely noticed it, but you felt yourself take a step toward Tulipelle and she stepped toward you. She closed her eyes as she put her hands on your shoulders. You closed your eyes, placed your hands on Tulipelle&#39;s hips and leaned forward. The next thing you felt were your lips touching Tulipelle&#39;s and then your tongue seemed to be wrestling with hers and your arms began to wrap around her her as her arms wrapped around you, as if to pull the both of you closer to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it! They do like each other!&quot; came Rosetta&#39;s voice which seemed get time started again and broke the kiss between you and Tulipelle had just shared.<br />
<br />
Both of you stopped and looked at how close you were to each other. You then looked to Dandel and Rosetta, who were standing nearby. Dandal had a fairly polite smile, but Rosetta looked positively triumphant. That made both of you back off and blush heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; you spoke weakly, wanting to hide behind Tulipelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;For what?&quot; Rosetta commented, &quot;You kissed. It was beautiful and you&#39;ll be heartfriends!&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced to Tulipelle, and her cheeks looked just as red as yours surely did.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I... I just...&quot; you stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you like Tulipelle, Irisette?&quot; Dandal asked politely, &quot;I know you you&#39;ve said you&#39;re still adapting to being a fairy... but that kiss... well, it would indicate that both of you might be holding back some things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... she&#39;s pretty and she agreed to help me even when she didn&#39;t have to,&quot; you said, &quot;she didn&#39;t get mad at me for eating her food without her permission. I&#39;ve never even had a girlfriend on Earth who would do what Tulipelle&#39;s done for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you, Tulipelle, how do you feel about Irisette?&quot; Dandel asked, &quot;That kiss was rather passionate... to passionate to be simply between friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We just got carried away with the planning for your ceremony,&quot; Tulipelle said quickly, her cheeks as red as ripe normal cherries.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only one who would have been including that in our ceremony would be Rosetta,&quot; Dandel commented, looking over to Rosetta, who still had a triumphant smirk on her face, &quot;You commented about liking romance and then the two of you did kiss. So, do you like Irisette... and by that more than as a friend or a source for your research on humans?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... she was kind of cute when she was a he... and he was hurt and hadn&#39;t done anything to hurt me,&quot; Tulipelle admitted, not losing her blush, &quot;and when he said he was curious... I wanted to be friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re most definitely friends!&quot; Rosetta gave a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when he became Irisette... she was quite beautiful, but that had been completely by accident... and I should have told her about what the magic in our food would do to a human,&quot; Tulipelle continued, &quot;I was sure Irisette was going to be mad with me... just as others have been when my interest in the human world got in the way or when I&#39;d made a mistake on the dates that Rosetta had set me up on... but Irisette said it was her fault and that she knew or had some idea on what it would do... being so caring and polite, especially when she didn&#39;t have to be...&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of what Tulipelle said made you curious, but you didn&#39;t want to get into it. You were already too embarrassed to get further into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... speaking honestly, the two of you DO have at least some attraction to you, am I right?&quot; Dandal questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes...&quot; Tulipelle said weakly, &quot;but I didn&#39;t want to force anything on Irisette.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose so... but I didn&#39;t want to be impolite or impose on anyone,&quot; you added, &quot;and if much of what Tulipelle&#39;s done to help me is only because of her promise... I didn&#39;t want to come off as some sort of jerk with someone who didn&#39;t like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t a jerk!&quot; Tulipelle blurted to you.<br />
<br />
Dandal only smiled, &quot;Well... it would appear that the two of you do like each other. Odd and rapid perhaps... but then not unheard of...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard a rumor once that our Queen&#39;s eldest daughter found a &quot;peasant&quot; fairy picking flowers by a stream once and fell in love almost on sight,&quot; Dandel mused, &quot;and as Tulipelle spoke to you, we fairies do enjoy romance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; you said weakly.<br />
<br />
You looked between Rosette and Dandal and then to Tulipelle. Rosetta looked triumphant, that all her jabs and jokes about you and Tulipelle being heartfriends were right. Dandal looked fairly friendly, though she stayed close to Rosetta. Tulipelle looked a bit nervous and still very embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still sorry my... drama interrupted your wedding planning,&quot; you said to Dandel and Rosetta.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Dandel said politely, &quot;Tulipelle, Rosetta, and I have been friends for a long time and my amorapromised has spent a lot of her time to find her friend a heartfriend with the idea of all of us being happy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now Tulipelle has you!&quot; Rosetta smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... can we get a moment to talk before anything goes any further?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Dandal smiled, &quot;Rosetta and I will give the two of you some space.&quot;</p>
