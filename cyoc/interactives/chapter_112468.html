<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a dimension far, far away from the concerns of the Earth, or any planet for that matter, a realm where time and space have no meaning, another contest, one far more important, was also taking place. The battle for Sorcerer(ess) Supreme. The contest and its rules were simple: Bring life back to a dead world. A world that had been destroyed by evil magical forces billions of years ago. The gods who were overseeing the contest watched as dozens of would-be wielders of the ultimate forces of the universe tried their best to reignite the process of life. The two gods, a brother and sister, both had a lucky horse that they were betting on. The brother was betting on an Earth woman named Aziza al-Rashid, formerly a young man from one of the poorer regions of Saudi Arabia. She was a smart but reckless girl who possessed a practically intuitive understanding of how things worked. Magic was no exception, as Aziza had already mastered several difficult spells beyond her paygrade. The sister, Inanna, was rooting for Regina Chung, another Earth man turned woman, from America. She was a scientist, or at least she used to be, and up until a few days ago in Earth time, had been a high school teacher who had resigned in shame and fear once she saw the laws of physics crumble beneath her feet. But she was beginning to open her eyes to the bigger mysteries of the universe, becoming at once a better scientist, and someone who would soon do things that would place her own will above the laws of nature. The older and more methodical woman, Regina was incrementally discovering what happened to this place of death and pain. <br />
<br />
The brother and sister smiled as they saw Regina invite Aziza away from her sad spark of life that she was desperately clinging to as they planned to refurbish this dead planet together. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, North Carolina just went to Drumpf&quot; said Elizabeth with a shocked expression, looking at Robbie with serious worry on her face, her heart beating loudly in her chest. &quot;You don&#39;t think...&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie, who after more than two months as a woman was finally settled down more or less,  held her forehead in her hand, frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone at work said that they were voting for her. I can&#39;t believe it either. After what she said she wanted to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d think that turning into a woman would make her more compassionate towards abortion rights, but no...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or look at ISIS. They all just gave up. There&#39;s still terrorists out there, but we don&#39;t have to worry about Sharia Law coming to the U.S anymore, not that we ever did have to worry. But these people still want to ban Muslims from the country regardless. Just because they&#39;re different. You can turn some old, angry redneck into Daisy Duke, but she&#39;s still a hateful bigot on the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth then went back to thinking about those two women, the ones who had done all this. One of them had a magic ring.  Maybe they could change things if somehow, against all polling data, that bitch Drumpf got elected.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, their daughter Billie was upstairs coloring, munching on the few remaining pieces of leftover Halloween candy that she had in her candy bag. She and her family had gone out as Star Wars characters for her first trick or treating expedition, and it had been a blast. Mommy(Elizabeth) had been Princess Leia, Mom(Robbie) had been Mara Jade from the books, and Billie herself had been the most adorable little Rey on the block. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Drumpf was watching the polling results on CNN. Since The Great Change, Wolf Blitzer had become a leggy brunette who possessed a passing resemblance to Mila Kunis, and Drumpf could barely concentrate on what the news anchor was saying as the seventy-year old man trapped in the body of an early twenties woman was staring at Blitzer&#39;s spectacular body. Had Drumpf still been a man, she would have grabbed the recently christened Luna Blitzer by the pussy in a hot second. &quot;Hell&quot; thought Drumpf to herself &quot;We&#39;re all lesbians now anyway, so I guess I could still grab her pussy and get away from it. After all, I&#39;m a star!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Drumpf looked over at her children. All four of her adult kids were gorgeous, supermodelesque vixens. Drumpf had once gotten in trouble back when she was a man for saying that he&#39;d date his daughter if she wasn&#39;t his daughter. Now she looks at all four of them and starts to think the same thing. Hell, she stares at herself in the mirror sometimes and wants to fuck her reflection. Then again, she had wanted to fuck herself her entire life. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Dani and Tiffany, who had been going steady for the last few weeks, were watching the election results together at Dani&#39;s house. Dani&#39;s sister, grandmother, mother, and born-mother were also in attendance. After The Great Change, Tiffany no longer had to worry about the precarious situation of trans rights, but the psychic wounds of being a cultural minority for so long were still there. Thankfully, Dani had been nothing but a sweetheart to her and almost made her forget about the bad times...<br />
<br />
&quot;And the state of South Carolina goes to Donna Drumpf...&quot; said the new woman news anchor. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking seriously!&quot; screamed Logan at her own house as Allison rubbed her shoulders gently. Logan&#39;s therapy had been going well, and nobody wanted another relapse.</p>
