<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael looked over his profile a bit before making his decision.  As interesting as it would be to change his age, size, or species; he was also interested in certain questions he might never had known the answer to before he received the Chronivac.  He clicked &quot;Gender&quot; on his profile and changed the &quot;Male&quot; to &quot;Female.&quot;  Once he did that he saw a &quot;Go&quot; button appear under his profile.  After clicking it, a new dialogue box appeared asking &quot;Adjust reality to match?&quot;  Shrugging, Micheal clicked &quot;Yes&quot; and waited for a bit before standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how is this supposed to wor...?!&quot;  Micheal suddenly felt a wave of tingling throughout his body.  Without warning, his perspective seemed to lower quite a bit, like if he was moving to sit down.  Michael made his way over to the full body mirror in his room and after looking in it, realized he had gotten shorter.  The tingling continued on, Michael watched as his hair grew longer and his face began to morph; any signs of facial hair disappeared entirely, his cheekbones elevated a bit, his nose became smaller, his jaw became less angular.  His hair finally fell to about mid-back and he had realized his face had become completely feminine, rather pretty even.<br />
<br />
Next, Micheal felt tingling in his shoulders as they narrowed and up his arms as they lost almost all of their hair, became slimmer as they lost muscle, and his hands becoming smaller and a little more delicate looking.  Michael then felt a tingling around his chest and he watched as his chest seemed to inflate.  Lifting the collar of his shirt, Michael saw he was growing breasts!  They stopped growing at about c-cup size and a relatively plain bra appeared on his new breasts.<br />
<br />
Next he felt tingling going from his waist and hips all the way down his legs to his feet as his waist narrowed, his hips became wider and matched his narrowed shoulders in width, his legs slimmed a bit and lost almost all of their hair while his feet became smaller and more delicate looking like his hands did.  Finally he felt a tingling around his groin, so Michael quickly lifted his jeans and watched with fascination and a bit of dread as his penis and testes seemed to retract and disappear into his body, leaving a vagina behind while his boxers become panties, and then he felt a slightly nauseating sensation around his groin as his testes must have been converted into ovaries.<br />
<br />
As Michael was registering that &quot;he&quot; had become &quot;she&quot;, the clothes on his, now her, body shifted a bit, his t-shirt shrank a bit for a better fit and the shorts Michael was wearing became more formfitting to his, now her, hips and legs.  Finally the room around Michael began to shift, becoming feminized.  The clothes in the closet changed, with a few dresses mixing with more feminine t-shirts hanging inside.  Micheal checked the dresser and saw the boxers inside had become bras and panties.<br />
<br />
After all changes have stopped, Micheal looked at his now her, reflection.  Seeing a rather pretty teenage girl replacing the boy she once was.  Michael mused in his shock that if he had met such a girl when he was a guy, he would want to date her.  Michael made his way back to his computer and checked his profile, what he saw left him more shocked then before.<br />

Michael, now Michelle sat back in her chair shocked at what had just transpired.  Reality had altered to seemingly make it so that he had always been a girl.  If she thought long and hard about it, she was convinced that she could remember things about this life too.  Playing with dolls when she was little, which she grew out of years ago, learning to cook with her mother,  looking after and playing with her younger sisters more, dealing with teenage boys, and having to deal with, you shutter slightly, periods.  She shook her head as she thought of such things, and wondered if she should change back immediately, see what this life held for her, or change something else about herself.</p>
