<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia sat on her back patio looking out into the gardens. At least the prior owners had the sense to make use of their land rather than letting it sit bearing nothing. She twirled her fork over her breakfast, mindlessly spinning a piece of waffle in the syrup. Those two cooks she&#39;d consumed as part of her act of granting their wish had settled in nicely. Feeling more invigorated than she had since she had woken up, she gave her stomach an appreciative pat. Remembering the taste of the assistant caused her to absently lick her lips. Taking the piece of waffle she&#39;d been soaking in syrup into her mouth, she sighed about having to grant so many mundane wishes lately. In order to attract more attention, she&#39;d had to let a larger number of them get away than she had in the past. Other a month of the game, Catch and Release, she&#39;d gained notoriety and expected some to come back for a second wish.<br />
<br />
Leaning back in her seat, she stared at the sky, there must be an easier way... Marina made her way over to Selicia&#39;s table and waited to be called on. The young woman was quite excitable at times causing her to lose her sense of propriety, a small failing not worth dealing with as of yet. Her eagerness to serve during those excitable moments made up for it enough as it was. Selicia called her over to listen to what she had to say. Apparently, there were a couple of individuals from the local news wanting to interview the &quot;witch&quot;... Witch, Selicia was never all that fond of the moniker but, what the simple didn&#39;t understand, they threw simple labels on. Telling Marina to send them in to see her at the patio, Selicia sat up and waited to appraise the arrivals.<br />
<br />
Another Male/Female duo approached her table from the house interior. The pair were older, possibly into their early forties but, fairly well kept. The Male had brown eyes, his brown hair starting to show signs of graying, his modest height and frame made him give off a rather stately appeal. The woman&#39;s teal eyes stood out from her deep auburn hair, her bust held out to a comfortable C, she obviously took care of herself as her body showed little of the rigors of age. Selicia found herself rather impressed by their appearances, enough to allow them an audience with her. Before seating themselves, they introduced their names to Selicia, Walter and Annette. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve heard so much about you, it seems the rumors of your beauty were true after all.&quot; Walter spoke with an affable smile as he sat across from Selicia. Flattery from the start, a common enough tactic...<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and seeing your home leads one to believe you&#39;re doing quite well at that.&quot; Annette spoke eyeing the surroundings before settling her eyes on Selicia. She might be a skeptic, that could be fun...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, thank you. Yes, as you can see I&#39;ve done quite well for myself and have quite a record of satisfaction.&quot; Selicia made sure to eye both of them individually. She wasn&#39;t about to let them run the conversation without her. &quot;Now, I understand you&#39;ve come to interview with me, yes?&quot; Settling her hands on her lap, she smiled peaceably waiting for their response.<br />
<br />
Clearing his throat, Walter continued the conversation down the proclaimed course. &quot;Yes, well. We wanted to do a piece on you for your proposed use of REAL magic.&quot; He stressed the word in a manner leading Selicia to believe they both were skeptical. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite right, we thought if we could get an example it would benefit us both.  You would get more publicity and our ratings would climb the charts.&quot; Annette gave a feigned smile compared to a momentary gleam in her eye. This woman was expecting to make Selicia appear to be a fraud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I could certainly accommodate such a request...&quot; Selicia smiled cheerfully, she eyed Marina who had been bringing treats for the guests to take them away. Marina nodded and retreated before the pair spotted her exit. &quot;What would you say to giving me a week to prepare?&quot; She kept her painted smile watching for their reactions to the proposal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Splendid, a week will give us enough time to announce the special and...&quot; Walter stopped abruptly as Selicia held up a finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will need a volunteer, preferably one provided by yourselves of course. We wouldn&#39;t want people believing that I staged the whole affair would we?&quot; Selicia grinned mischievously in the air of good humor while the two spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll volunteer myself then, all I need to do is make a simple wish, do I not?&quot; Annette&#39;s own air had settled into a haughty one. Knocking down this type was a pleasurable pastime.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be wonderful, Ms. Annette. Why, with one so esteemed as the volunteer, I don&#39;t believe anyone would doubt the authenticity.&quot; Selicia spoke with barely feigned delight, she would just adore putting Annette in her place, literally...<br />
<br />
The pair left with Marina guiding them back out through the main hall while Selicia grinned wildly. An opportunity of two kinds had dropped right into her lap, she&#39;d gain more clients and remove a pest at the same time. What more could she ask for? Maybe, another beautiful host to play with but, she had to work with what she had been given. After waiting for what she felt was an ample amount of time for them to leave, she entered the manor proper, there was some preparation to be made. Sadly, this meant she had to do a little covering up of previous trophies. <br />
<br />
With the day finally upon her, Selicia sat luxuriating in her bright and shimmering blue dress. She had simply taken the liberty of relieving a maid with &quot;sticky fingers&quot; of her humanity. A terrible thief of a girl but, a wonderful sheet of tasteful nude pasties to cover some of the naughty parts of her collection. Rather than put them away as she initially thought, she surmised it was best just to leave them out as normal. Eyeing the sheet of leftover pasties, she enjoyed looking at the nude from of the red haired girl coyly covering nipples with her right arm and her vagina with her left hand. It was a quick fix but, a simple punishment as well.<br />
<br />
The pair of interviewers arrived with crew and equipment, setting up in her consulting room. The crews&#39; eyes ogled one object to the next while the pair remained professionally attentive to Selicia. While they had time, Selicia slipped a document in front of Annette with a un-styled pen for her to sign. &quot;Just a formality Dear, I cannot guarantee full control over how the magic interprets your wish. This is just standard procedure of course, once the magic had run its course it&#39;d be a simple matter of undoing it afterward. Unless of course, you&#39;d like to make the effects permanent.&quot; She eyed Annette posing a silent challenge to the woman.<br />
<br />
Annette shrewdly looked over the document for several minutes, obviously looking for anything amiss or some kind of loophole. &quot;Fine then, let&#39;s get this done shall we?&quot; She signed the document turning it back to Selicia, the words of the page shifted as Selicia set it aside.<br />
<br />
The beginning of the interview started rather routinely with an introduction and a small explanation of what was to come. Walter sat proudly as he went over the details exclaiming with a gesture that his partner would be the volunteer of the evening. Annette primped herself with the attention being drawn to her in an effort to seem more glamorous. Selicia showed off some of her example pieces around the room explaining the purpose behind each piece admitting to being a bit eccentric. Soon, they were ready for the main event of the evening. &quot;So, what is your wish Ms. Annette?&quot; Settling herself to hear what mundane wish she&#39;d ask for, Selicia positioned herself to seem interested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I assure you I&#39;ve given this quite the consideration.&quot; Annette puffed up, posing intellectually for the assembled cameras. &quot;I also spend so much time in make-up preparing to go on air. I feel it&#39;d be nice if I could stay all dolled up without any of the effort.&quot; She laughed slyly as she practically sneered at Selicia with her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;A simple and practical wish indeed then... Let&#39;s get started shall we? I&#39;ll do my best to explain the proceedings to everyone as the magic does it&#39;s work. Selicia gave Annette a pleasant smile, careful not to reveal her intention too soon. With a flick of her wrist and a little bit of glamour, she sent the magic visibly toward Annette. The collected group watched in almost exaggerated awe at the simple glamour of light. With the magic in place, Selicia was quite sure to make the stages happen rather quickly and controlled. First, she tightened the Annette&#39;s skin to give her a more youthful appearance. &quot;As you can see, the magic has started working already, simple wishes are easily translated.&quot; Annette rubbed her skin as the next change swept over her, she rubbed her legs together in subtle discomfort. &quot;Now the magic has made her appear more youthful and has just removed any unwanted body hair.&quot; Not to mention, with each successive stroke Selicia was driving Annette into lust. <br />
<br />
Watching Annette squirm was enough to bring Selicia to enjoy her next few steps. &quot;So with the next stage, it&#39;s rather simple really... The magic will just take the makeup already applied and make it more permanent.&quot; The magic effect this time was so subtle, it passed unseen although Annette was starting to breathe heavily. Walter noticed and motioned a hand toward the cameras to cut to a break. Annette assured the crew that she was fine to continue, just a bit flushed. They didn&#39;t want to miss the next stage so they came back to the interview in progress. Selicia forged ahead causing the magic to remove any blemishes in her skin. &quot;Blemishes are usually considered to be unsightly so the magic deigned to give her skin her uniform tone.&quot; Annette hand clamped onto the couch arm as the magic drove her ever deeper into ecstasy. <br />
<br />
Seeing Annette fighting so valiantly to appear in control, Selicia decided to bring the show slowly to a close. Magic crept unseen up Annette&#39;s legs making everything it passed into a quite realistic replica of itself. Annette started to groan and stifle moans fighting the urges striving over her. Selicia raised a staying hand toward Walter as he began to motion again. &quot;Unfortunately, it seems that she&#39;s quite sensitive to the magic&#39;s advance. I&#39;m afraid everyone will miss the finale if you cut the feed now. What do you say, Ms. Annette?&quot; Annette to her credit gave the motion to continue as the changes reached her thighs. Once they reached her vagina, Selicia ramped up the effects causing a carnal howl out of the woman. A large wet spot grew rapidly on her khaki shirt as she was driven to consecutive orgasms before the change moved on. Now the annoying woman laid back stupefied by pleasure with drool pouring off her hanging tongue, if Selicia wasn&#39;t mistaken... Yes, there were two wets spots dribbling down her blouse, Selicia barely suppressed the chuckle.<br />
<br />
By now, the change had begun down her arms causing a visible firmness with them. Walter looked concerned toward Annette and then Selicia seeking an explanation. Making her best impression of deep thought, Selicia examined the nearly completed changes affecting the woman.  As the change swept over Annette&#39;s hair locking her absent bliss onto her face, Selicia turned to the assembled people around her. &quot;Ah, it seems the magic has taken her wish quite literally... She&#39;s been a rather expensive doll, self sufficient but, still a doll.&quot; Walter swept past Selicia checking the fate of the Late Annette.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true, it&#39;s actually real... She&#39;s truly a doll through and through.&quot; Walter checked the arms and face feeling the false flesh. He turned to stare at Selicia in complete disbelief before remembering the cameras. &quot;Yes, I have confirmed it, Madam Selicia is truly magical. Let this be known to you all and serve as a warning to take care in your desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Walter spoke to the cameras, Selicia eyed the doll even more thoroughly, apparently it was self lubricating as the spot grew on the skirt. Settling the doll upright and as properly as it could be managed, she turned back to Walter. &quot;In accordance with her contract, she&#39;ll be given a choice to stay as is or have it reversed.&quot; The man sputtered and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t see why she would choose to stay like this... Let me see the contract...&quot; Selicia handed the document over to Walter with a confident look, she had changed it after all. With a disbelieving look , Walter handed the document back to Selicia. &quot;Well, get to reversing it then, we should hear what she&#39;s decided.<br />
<br />
Selicia mentally bristled at the given command but, smoothed her temper out before responding. &quot;It will take time, I&#39;ll send her to you once the reversal is complete.&quot; She nodded to Marina to &quot;make arrangements&quot; as to appease Walter. <br />
<br />
&quot;See that you do...&quot; Walter left before the crew did and Selicia feigned casting a spell until their vehicles had all gone. <br />
<br />
Straightening herself up, Selicia appraised the suit worn by the doll. Reversing the change would do no good for her now as she&#39;d been lost in the pleasure given to her. Stripping the doll of its clothes, she snapped causing the stains to vanish and took a hard look at Annette. Selicia removed her clothes and consciously molded herself into a duplicate of a reverted Annette and donned the doll&#39;s old clothes. &quot;You won&#39;t be needing these anymore, so I&#39;m just going to use them for a bit. The only seeming response was a quiet bubble of fluid from her vagina. With that, Selicia strode out of the manor toward the road and made for their station.<br />
<br />
She arrived at the station with a few magical steps and eyes the moderately sized building, it was time to perform once again. Straightening up with a self important air, Selicia strode into the the building and smugly eyed the receptionist. &quot;Has Walter already arrived?&quot; The receptionist nodded and pointed in the general direction of his office as Selicia curtly walked away. She saw the man sitting at his desk seeming visibly frustrated as she sat before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you even read that document before you signed it, you silly woman?&quot; Walter stared into Selicia&#39;s eyes looking for a hit of something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did, I agreed to everything that was placed before me.&quot; Selicia sidled up in her chair in defiance as the man slumped before her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your decision is simple isn&#39;t it? You couldn&#39;t possibly appreciate what had been done to you, could you?&quot; He spoke from behind a hand placed over his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact, it is simple. She&#39;s offered me a better deal under her, I&#39;m resigning immediately. Send my things to her manor when they&#39;re collected.&quot; She stood walking for the door leaving the man in abject shock. Selicia quickly jaunted back to her manor and discarded the clothing. Feeling her proper shape returning to her, she redressed in the clothing she shed prior. Eyeing the doll finally starting to dry from its experience this evening. &quot;Well now, that settles it. You got your ratings and I got my publicity.&quot; She leaned forward pressing down a nipple on Annette&#39;s breast. &quot;Just remember, you belong to me now.&quot;  She flicked her finger upward causing a slight leak of fluids from the nipple and the vagina below. &quot;Such a good night, after all.&quot;</p>
