<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following morning, when Jade woke up, she felt as if she'd been sleeping on a cloud. She'd greatly enjoyed having Megan as a nightgown and knew that this was probably not the last time something like this was gonna happen, but she also wanted her friend back to her old self of course. She looked at the clock and saw that it was 8 AM. &quot;two more hours...&quot; she said to herself. Looking down, she wondered what Megan's night had been like. Had Megan enjoyed it just as much as she did? What was it like to be her right now? Lots of questions filled her mind that she'd only be getting an answer to in two hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breakfast's ready in 10 minutes, kids!&quot; Jade's mom called upstairs. She actually wanted to keep on wearing Megan for a bit longer, but decided against it. She took off her nightgown and placed it on the bed and then she put on some new clothes from the closet before brushing her teeth and getting herself ready for another day. Then she went downstairs for some breakfast.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;... And then I kicked the monster all the way to the moon!&quot; Matthew said, who was avidly talking about his dream. Jade always found it amusing to listen to his little adventures while eating her cornflakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Jade. What a lovely nightgown you've gotten yourself,&quot; Jade's mom said, re-entering the room.<br />
<br />
Jade looked up, realizing that her mom must have been in her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get it?&quot; her mom asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it's not mine actually. It's Megan's. I have it on loan,&quot; Jade lies. &quot;I'm gonna buy myself a new one today.&quot; She got a little bit red there. She didn't want to lie to her mother, but she'd never believe the truth!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see. Well you should get yourself one of those then,&quot; Jade's mom said. &quot;It's a good thing I put it in the laundry then. Wouldn't want to give such a lovely nightgown back without it being washed, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade's eyes widened. She did WHAT?! &quot;R-Right.&quot; Jade said scared. Her friend was in the washing machine! She got terrified of what might happen. Looking at the clock, she saw that it was still a long while to go before Megan turned back so that wouldn't be a problem, but the fact that her friend was in the washing machine still frightened her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong, honey?&quot; Jade's mom asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... oh no, nothing. Nothing's wrong,&quot; Jade quickly says. &quot;I just got a bit of a headache. That's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, do you want some aspirin then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's not too bad. I can deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then. Do get well soon then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jade didn't know what to do. She kept envisioning what might happen in her mind. Would Megan drown? Was that possible as a nightgown? hesitantly, she just kept eating her cornflakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
As soon as she was finished, she darted upstairs towards the washing machine to find it up and running. Occasionally, she could catch a glimpse of Megan in there, confirming her mother's actions. &quot;I am so sorry, Megan. I didn't mean for this to happen,&quot; Jade said, terified.<br />
<br />
She thought about what to do. She couldn't exactly stop the washing machine to let Megan out so she was forced to watch her friend being washed completely. But then what would happen afterwards? She'd be all wet and if she didn't act quickly, her mom would put her in the dryer afterwards, which would be a terrible thing because if that happened, Megan would surely transform back while in the dryer. That is, assuming that Megan would survive all this of course. She did not want to think about that though and thus, Jade simply decided to just wait around until the washing machine was finished. She just went back to her room, hoping she might be able to find something on the internet.<br />
<br />
<br />
At about 9 AM, she heard a loud *ding*, announcing that the washing machine was done, followed by some footsteps going up the stairs. She had to act now, before her mom would put Megan in the dryer! She darted out of her room and arrived at the washing machine just as her mother was taking Megan out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Jade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Oh please, don't scare me like that. What is it?&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just remembered... please don't put Megan...'s nightgown in the dryer! It'll shrink!&quot; Jade made up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! It's a good thing you remembered that on time then! Be a dear, please, and hang it on the clothesline outside then,&quot; Jade's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay mom, I will!&quot; Jade said, taking the soaked Megan from her. Then she remembered though that hanging Megan on the clothesline might not be such a good idea either, considering she'll be turning back in about an hour completely naked... &quot;Actually... I'm gonna take it to her right now. Cya mom!&quot; she said, and before her mom could question this strange behavior, jade was already gone.<br />
<br />
Quickly gathering her stuff, Megan's clothes and her bag, along with a towel just in case, she made for the front-door and quickly left her house. What was she gonna do now? Where would she go? She had to find a safe place for Megan to safely transform back without being seen. Then she remembered the secluded part of the park. Jade and Megan would often go there when they just wanted to be left alone and in all the years that they came there, they'd never seen anybody else who knew of their little hiding spot! It'd be the perfect place for Megan's tranformation she figured! She would, of course, be completely naked when she transforms back though, but considering that today was once again very warm, that wouldn't be too much of a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
When she got there, she looked at her watch. 9:50 AM. In 10 more minutes, she'd finally find out what Megan's predicament is. She carefully placed Megan on the grass and then started walking around nervously. Every now and then she'd look at her watch again, only to find that just one or so minute had past since the last time she checked.<br />
<br />
This went on for the full 10 minutes, but then it was finally 10 AM and Jade expectantly looked at the nightgown on the ground.</p>
