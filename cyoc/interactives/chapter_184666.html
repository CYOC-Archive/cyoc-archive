<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rebecca sighed, &quot;You know, if we just used a certain quote unquote magic camera, we wouldn&#39;t HAVE to change him all the time...&quot;<br />
<br />
Emile shook his head and sternly addressed his daughter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone would like to, Becca, but we have a responsibility to not let this camera go into the wrong hands, who knows what could happen to your baby brother if he was changed, why, he could end up as our cat, a maid, or even your grandmother! And we may not even know it.&quot; He said, holding the babbling baby in his hands, who just a camera click before was his newly christened father. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine, you don&#39;t have to get all young adult&#39;s novel on me dad, I get it.&quot; Rebecca ran a hand through her hair, speaking with her father, while he loved her dearly, never went her way when it came to the Camera. <br />
<br />
She had to admit, after being treated as a princess for most of her life, maybe this is the one thing she just had to find another way around. Maybe she could get him to take her on a field trip to the mall, dad&#39;s always enjoyed having their kids butter them up with &quot;quality time&quot;, and once she-<br />
<br />
As she glanced away to think on her illustrious scheme, Becca gazed at her mother toying with the very magical camera her father warned her about and watched in idle terror as she flicked button to button and twisted a dial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, dad...&quot; Becca began, just as her mother clicked the camera and reality had already begun to change.<br />
<br />
[FLASH]<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, princess?&quot; Eric asked, not realizing reality had confounded his memories and his name to sway the awareness in his mind. <br />
<br />
At a youthful 39 years old, Eric had many things on his mind, from entertaining the idea of balancing a healthy work life balance to how wonderful his life was with a darling teenager and baby boy in his grips. He turned to his daughter, expectantly waiting a response, only to see the auburn haired girl pause, glancing confused before blinking and shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I was going to ask if you could take me to the mall today? I wanted to get something nice to wear with my birthday money and Julia&#39;s was having a sale...&quot; <br />
<br />
Eric smiled, sure getting old was one factor, but being able to make his little girl happy was one of life&#39;s most simplest treasures. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course sweetie, we&#39;ll just have to get the boss on board and I think we can arrange that. But you may have to convince her a little, last I heard, she was going on about some antique camera her family had so she may be feeling a little sentimental.&quot; Hoisting David on his shoulder, Eric patted him gently and winked at his daughter. <br />
<br />
Beth giggled, and all felt right in the world, even if her brother was perhaps the most embarrassing thing in the world sometimes.<br />
____________________<br />
<br />
Olivia blinked, feeling her brain being wracked as she brought the camera down from her eyes and watching the scene before her. As she scanned the pool for her husband David she found herself staring at the well built man with brown chestnut hair and beard holding a baby speaking to a young girl.<br />
<br />
Something was telling her this seemed to be normal, but as she scanned for Rebecca and Emily, she as she gripped the camera tighter looking upon these strangers, she quickly felt a growing threat growing in her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;David? Emily...? Becca...? Did-Did I...?&quot; She clutched the camera and the realization dawned on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no it&#39;s the <I>camera</I>, Great Aunt Ruthy was right, the camera CAN change people, but...&quot; She paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, I can fix this, if these three were my family before, I can get them back.&quot; Olivia sighed, she could not let this life change further than it had to. <br />
<br />
She walked down from her perch in the master bedroom and looked as she saw the family pictures had altered to fit the new reality, David had been replaced by the strapping Eric who was no stranger to showing off his physique. She felt herself grow uncomfortable as she scanned pictures of Eric and her celebrating life achievements and family trips, Rebecca&#39;s childhood, and David&#39;s first birthday as she made her way down to the pool. The house hadn&#39;t changed beyond formatting to the reality alterations, but each tiny change in the fabric of life were poking at Olivia&#39;s heart and mind as she scurried out from the side glass door.<br />
<br />
_______<br />
<br />
David quietly observed himself as Eric held him, comfortable at this man he didn&#39;t really &quot;know&quot; keeping him steady, but could not help but feel things were not right. Wasn&#39;t he bigger like this man? Wasn&#39;t there two girls in the water splashing? A loud sliding noise had brought the man holding him to turn and David saw his mommy, no, that wasn&#39;t right, when he was big, his mommy liked him a lot. There was something that made him like this, and he remembered it look like a toy. He tried to speak but could only bubble his words and nibble on his hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not small, am big! David want big!&quot; his mind screeched, but all little Davie could do was mumble a &quot;Bah!&quot; and suck on his fist.<br />
_______<br />
<br />
Olivia gasped as she entered the pool, her energy that was propelling her to fix the mess was ebbing away and facing these strangers had left her growing weaker. This was not her life, this was not <I>their</I> lives, but...<br />
<br />
Eric smiled, setting David down on the pool chair and held his arms open, giving Olivia a generous view of his large imposing hairy chest and trimmed abs.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s my beautiful wife,&quot; He beckoned, scooping up Olivia in his arms and hoisting her up to her shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, gross, get a room you two!&quot; The teenager groaned, looking back at her phone. The muscular man chuckled, lowering her to eye level and spoke lowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how are you today, gorgeous?&quot; His white teeth glistened. Olivia gulped, afraid of speaking out of turn, but her mind found a name and she took the plunge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, Eric, perfect. I was just a little under the weather is all, you know, allergies.&quot; She said, looking away from him.<br />
<br />
Eric chuckled and kissed her on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, your uh, lovely daughter would like to ask if we could have an outing today at the mall, think that&#39;d be okay with you today?&quot; He leaned his head towards her, as if to administer puppy eyes.<br />
<br />
Olivia found herself entranced and turned to look at his dark brown eyes and felt mesmerized, before the face of her young daughter Emily replaced his and her mental fortitude came back. This was wrong, this was so utterly wrong, and she had to change this, but-</p>
