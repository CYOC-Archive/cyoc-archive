<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Lutro,&quot; Brer said, &quot;why don't you take Bandit to one of the rooms to calm down? I'll take over for you until you're ready.&quot; <br />
<br />
The otter nodded and the bear gave him a key. Lutro helped his friend back the hall to the room closest to Ozzy's office. After entering, <br />
he helped the raccoon to the bed and looked around. The room consisted of a queen bed, a large sofa, a cabinet full of sex toys, and a <br />
recliner. In one corner of the room, the carpet changed to tile where a sink, toilet, and double-shower stood. All of the decorations were <br />
bright red to heighten the passion of the moment for the customers, but Lutro wasn't paying attention to color schemes just now. He <br />
was back to staring at Bandit. <br />
<br />
The raccoon boy was curled up on the bed: his wet eyes closed against the world, his thong still pulled down past his crotch. The boy's <br />
striped tail flicked nervously and his ears perked at every noise, causing him to shudder. Lutro sat down on the bed next to him and <br />
Bandit clutched his arm desperately. After a few minutes of silence filled only by Bandit's heavy breathing, the raccoon released the <br />
otter's arm. He looked up at his friend slowly and tenderly. Another moment of silence followed where Lutro wasn't quite sure what to <br />
think. Before he could ask Bandit why he was staring, the raccoon spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lutro, I was so scared of that guy. I thought he was going to rape me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh, you know that never would have happened. Chuck was there before I could blink and Clint was standing in the entrance to the <br />
hallway because he heard. Besides them, Brer and all of us guys would have helped out if they needed it. You were never in any real <br />
danger, he just got to scare you before Chuck kicked his ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said these words confidently and he saw Bandit relax a little. Deep down, however, Lutro had doubts about his words. Pleasure <br />
Island was full of magic-wielding creatures. If one decided he really wanted one of the boys, the only ones who could do anything were <br />
the adults. What if they were outmatched?<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Lutro. I know you would have done anything to help. But I'm still afraid. I came to Pleasure Island because I thought having a <br />
job would be safe. I'm an orphan, Lutro, and I ran with a street gang before I came here. Just two days ago, the day before I got on <br />
that boat, two of my friend's got in a fight and one stabbed the other. I watched him die because I couldn't rat out my other friend. I <br />
decided to leave the gang and make a new life for myself. I have to admit this isn't what I had in mind, even if I am bisexual. But it <br />
seemed so safe. Now I don't know what to think anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be fine, Bandit. You were just unlucky, that's all. I heard Lago say that's the first time that's happened in three years. It's just a <br />
luck of the draw. You know what I think, though? I think your luck's about to change. With the money you make here, you can leave this <br />
island and go wherever you want. Just have faith that you'll be okay.&quot; Bandit began crying again, but this time with happiness. He sat up <br />
and hugged his friend again. Lutro returned the embrace and pat him on the back. When Bandit released him, he reached down and <br />
pulled the raccoon's pants back up. He didn't even realize he had done it, but Bandit blushed fiercely. &quot;Think you're ready to get back to <br />
work?&quot; He didn't notice his friend's red cheeks. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I still feel so...dirty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When he grabbed my butt, I could feel his breath on me. It smelled, too. He just looked dirty, every part of him. And when he touched <br />
my bare skin...I feel sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't do that, now!&quot; Lutro yelped and stood back, &quot;Maybe you should shower off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lutro walked over to the shower and started the water while Bandit took his thong completely off. He came over to the shower and <br />
Lutro opened the door for him. The raccoon began showering in a slow and deliberate fashion, as if making sure to scrub all the filth <br />
away. The otter boy found himself absentmindedly watching his friend, who eventually stared back at him. The two shared a shy gaze <br />
until they both blushed and looked away. Lutro tried to occupy himself with the cabinet full of toys. He wondered what each strange item <br />
was used for. After a moment, he heard slight grunts from the shower. He turned to see Bandit struggling to reach the small of his back. <br />
The raccoon thee up his hands in defeat and turned to Lutro. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, could you help me wash my back?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...sure, I guess,&quot; Lutro responded, somewhat nervously. <br />
<br />
The otter boy removed his thong and stepped into the shower with Bandit. He squirted some soap into his hands and began rubbing his <br />
friend's back. He felt the boy's smooth skin under his hands and unconsciously began to become aroused. The drink he had taken was <br />
starting to work. This sexual situation was making him want his friend; all previous inhibitions were set aside. The same was happening <br />
to Bandit. He began to moan softly as Lutro unconsciously moved lower and lower down his back until he was washing right under his <br />
tail. Bandit suddenly blurt out his thoughts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lutro, take me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to have sex with me. I've never done it before; I'm a virgin. I'm afraid to have sex with another man, but I know I have to do <br />
it. I don't trust them, but I trust you. You'll go easy on me for my first time. Then it'll be easier for me to do my job. Please, Lutro, fuck <br />
me. I want you to be my first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Had Jake Turnstill been who he had been that morning, he would have screamed no and ran out of there. But Jake wasn't Jake <br />
anymore; he was Lutro. Lutro was an otter, not a human. Lutro was bisexual, not straight. Lutro liked Bandit and Bandit liked Lutro. <br />
Bandit wanted Lutro mate with him and Lutro wasn't going to argue. <br />
<br />
Without saying anything, the otter scooped up the soap off his friend's back and began spreading it on the raccoon's hole. Bandit <br />
shuddered in response as Lutro used his finger to play with his entrance. Then, the finger was inserted. Bandit grunted, accepting the <br />
digit into himself. Lutro was surprised how easily his finger had gone in. He pulled it out, then decided to try two. A push and a grunt <br />
and Bandit was stretching himself around both. Three fingers went in, then four. After making sure Bandit was well-stretched, Lutro <br />
decided to go for it. <br />
<br />
For his part, Bandit could hardly contain himself when he felt a new piece of flesh against his hole. It wasn't thin and short like the <br />
fingers had been, it was thick and a half foot long. He wished Lutro would hurry up, he needed him inside of him...now! He began <br />
pushing back on the organ and Lutro got the message. <br />
<br />
The two weren't aware of the changes that the drugs they had been given were making. Lutro had thought Bandit would be too tight for <br />
his larger organ, but the raccoon had taken five fingers easily. The drugs allowed the boys to accommodate any size they were given. <br />
Bandit and Lutro could take a cock twice the size of Lutro's and only start to make an effort. He also didn't notice that small brown hairs <br />
were beginning to sprout from his previously smooth body. <br />
<br />
The otter grabbed his mate around the waist and pushed his cock in slowly. He had never felt so good! Bandit's insides were so warm <br />
and wet from the soap that Lutro felt his legs begin to shake from the sheer pleasure he was experiencing. For his part, Bandit was <br />
moaning lewdly and masturbating himself in time with Lutro's thrusts. The two boys went at it, hot and heavy, for about two more <br />
minutes before it became too much and they came simultaneously. Lutro thrust inside his friend up to his balls and filled the raccoon's <br />
rump with his boy juice. The white goo squished against his flesh as he slowed his thrusts to a stop and pulled out, allowing his spunk <br />
to drain from Bandit's rear. Bandit's semen sprayed onto the tile and was washed away by the water. <br />
<br />
As they stood there, basking in the afterglow and soaking in the hot water, Bandit turned to face Lutro. Without a word, the two pulled <br />
each other close and exchanged a long, tender kiss. Their new animal instincts told them that they were now mates. No matter who <br />
came after, they would always be each others' first. It was a pledge of loyalty: even though they had sex for a living, it would only be <br />
love between them. All this information was passed between the two in that kiss, and when it was broken and they put their clothes <br />
back on, they walked back to the barroom hand in hand.</p>
