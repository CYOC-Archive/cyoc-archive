<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I think I&#39;m going to do one more section and then this plot line will be done. Athough, if anyone&#39;s got other ideas, I&#39;d explore them.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Haylee and Josh considered the two brothers carefully. Clearly, the side effects of the ring no longer working on their manhoods had caught up with them. The young lady decided to rehash the situation as she saw it. “So, the two of you can’t swap your dicks,” coming out more as a statement than a question. <br />
<br />
The two boys nodded, Ethan, looking sheepish, while Eric rolled his eyes with a sly grin.<br />
<br />
Haylee took a breath to calm herself and then pressed onward, “and now you guys are changing, in quite a few ways….”<br />
<br />
Ethan glanced up at her face, struggling to meet her eyes, “what do you mean by that?” The older boy’s voice piped with a boyish uncertainty. He pouted at his tone and crossed his arms in annoyance.<br />
<br />
Haylee raised a finger, her mouth half-open. She stopped, put her hand down before explaining herself, “sure, all this started with you getting THAT,” she emphasized her words by pointing at Ethan’s two-inch, soft pecker, which barely made itself known under the denim of his jeans. “But look at your groin. It’s not that noticeable because you shave, Ethan, but you used to have scruff that you would deal with every few days.” She reached out and rubbed her fingers across the smooth skin on the lower part of his abs. <br />
<br />
Ethan hissed with pleasure as her fingers slipped across him effortlessly, encountering not even a bit of resistance. His dick stood at attention in response to her ministrations, desperate to be noticed, despite its shortcomings.<br />
<br />
Haylee mused to herself, “as convenient as it is for a swimmer not needing to shave, curious minds want to know, where did your hair go?”<br />
<br />
“Uhm, duh,” Josh snorted as he gestured at his shirtless friend. His hands waved across the exposed skin, now covered in a pelt of nearly-black fur across his chest, pointing down in a treasure trail that led to his quite-full set of boxers. “In case you didn’t notice, Eric looks like Sasquatch. He did NOT look like that a few weeks ago….”<br />
<br />
“Hey!” Eric grumbled as he felt his now hirsute body, his fingers gently twisting it before he ran one over his nipples. He blushed at the sensation, which jolted down to his crotch, which throbbed in evident appreciation. “I’m no Sasquatch, I mean, look at my back,” he twisted in place, revealing his taut shoulders, “not a hair to be seen,” he sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
Haylee shuddered at the thought, “talk about too much of a good thing. Hair should be in only certain places in the right amounts. But seriously, you’re thirteen, but you’re probably hairier than some grown men.”<br />
<br />
“Speaking of more than,” Josh interrupted as he considered Eric, “I get you got your brother’s junk, but why did your voice change so much? I mean, you sound even deeper than your brother.”<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged his shoulders with casual aloofness. His eyes grew lidded as he smiled with a confident smolder before he leaned toward his friend and declared with a quiet, firm, and deep voice, “luck of the draw, some guys just rock what they got.” He glanced downward, which made his friend’s eyes follow. Josh blushed at the tent in his underpants and jerked his eyes upward. Eric grinned, flashing his pearly whites, before he flexed his chest, causing each pec to bounce at his command, with surprisingly consistent and captivating results. “You like what you see, Joshie?” He whispered in a husky voice, causing the other boy to swallow as his eyes grew.<br />
<br />
Ehmm! Eric turned to look at Haylee, who looked blushed and had a bit of sweat beading on her forehead. “Eric, stop that! We get it; you’re sexy, now turn it down from eleven to five if you please.”<br />
<br />
Ethan had a hangdog expression on his face as his head hung between his sagging shoulders. Despite the two brothers having nearly a foot difference in height, at that moment, you probably couldn’t tell. If hardpressed, one might even mistakenly think that Eric was the taller sibling, simply because of the air of confidence he radiated. Ethan whimpered in a defensive voice, “but what about me?” He put up his arms in an unconfident way and attempted to do a double biceps to show off his toned musculature. The result was a forced display that made Josh frown, Eric snicker, and Haylee patted the bigger guy reassuringly on the shoulder and got him to put down his arms.<br />
<br />
She explained with reluctance, “Ethan, you’re a sweet guy, fit, and active, but no one’s going to say that you’re sexy.” He cringed as if slapped in the face. “Don’t get me wrong, I LIKE you, but while Eric’s sexy, you are,” she paused as she considered the best word to use. Finally, she snapped her fingers and exclaimed, “cute,” in that nauseating voice girls use around babies to catch their attention.<br />
<br />
Ethan smiled with a blush as he glanced down at his package; while he didn’t see any noticeable difference, HE knew that his pecker was now at full attention and even cranking out some pre-cum. He shook his head, trying to rid himself of the cobweb of horny thoughts that plagued him. <br />
<br />
Ethan looked up and asked Eric, “what were you doing before, “he gestured all over his little bro’s body, “all this happened?”<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged his shoulders as he explained with a confident voice, “me and Joshie were playing some video games, and he noticed what I was packing. He couldn’t help himself, and I let him go to town on me. Next thing I know, after he swallowed my load, all this happened.”<br />
Josh went pale as he glanced from the older boy to the girl, “Eric!” He hissed in embarrassed discomfort.<br />
<br />
“What?” Eric shrugged his shoulders, “it’s true.”<br />
<br />
Haylee interrupted, “I was playing around with Ethan earlier when he came. That’s when his voice cracked.”<br />
<br />
“So you think that cumming causes these changes?” Ethan frowned at the thought.<br />
<br />
Eric huffed in annoyance, “well fuck that. I’m not going to stop cumming because of this; it feels great. And really, I do not see any downsides here.”<br />
<br />
Haylee stared at him, eyes agog. “Seriously? If you keep this up, what’s going to happen next? Maybe you’ll grow a foot taller or start putting on muscles on your muscles in an instant.”<br />
<br />
“And that would be bad; why?” Eric rolled his eyes with a condescending smile.<br />
<br />
Haylee took in a deep breath and sighed, “because that’s all stuff people will notice. For goodness sake, I don’t even think you could pass off the voice change as puberty; your brother certainly can’t! I mean, guy’s voices don’t just relapse, you know.”<br />
<br />
“And so we get to the meat of it,” Eric crossed his arms as he glowered at her. “You want me to get the ring to swap us somehow back?” Haylee nodded her head, and Eric promptly cut her off, “look, somehow I managed to do that before. And what did I get for my troubles? I got a scolding because I managed to give him,” he stabbed his finger through the air at Ethan and continued, “this dick.” He glanced down at his package before declaring, “he couldn’t even use it to get off properly. But, I mean, come on, how completely incompetent do you have to be not to be able to seduce someone with it?”<br />
<br />
Eric glanced at Josh and explained, “I didn’t even need to do anything, and opportunities fell into my lap.” Then, he returned his focus to Haylee and Ethan, “I planned it so that the two of you would be in the same place at the same time. So he should have been able to get laid. And what happens? He totally failed. You want to know what I think?” He declared with grim certainty as he leveled his gaze at his older brother, whose eyes widened under his scrutiny. “I think you can’t handle this big dick,” Ethan swallowed with difficulty. “I think you can’t put it to good use, even if you had it. I think Mother Nature goofed up.”<br />
<br />
Haylee watched Ethan squirm and tried to interrupt, “Eric, that’s enough….”<br />
<br />
Eric spoke over her, “and you want to know what I think?” Ethan shook his head almost imperceptibly, “I think you like being this way,” Ethan panted as if he were running a mile. “I think you get off on YOUR teenie weenie, your little embarrassment.” The older boy started squirming in his seat. “You like living on the edge, with the fear of your LITTLE secret coming out for all to know and see.” Ethan put his hands down on the armrests of his chair, and they squeezed them so tight that they went bone-white. “And you know what I think?”<br />
Ethan shook his head as he shook in his chair under his little brother’s dominating gaze.<br />
<br />
“I think, on the inside, that you are,” Eric noticeably paused with each word, “a submissive – little – boy.” <br />
<br />
Ethan hissed between his teeth and practically squealed when his crotch jerked in place. His jeans developed a small dark spot as he struggled to catch his breath.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, now what’s going to happen?” Haylee mused softly aloud while Josh watched the scene with wide eyes. Eric grinned with satisfaction as he watched his brother come down from his handsfree cum. <br />
<br />
Ethan looked up at his brother, and the panicked look that Eric had seen before had settled into calm acceptance. His big brother slowly reached into his crotch and pulled out a balled-up pair of socks. With a moment’s hesitation, he considered it before letting it slip from his hand. Though made of cotton, one could have imagined hearing the sound of a gavel on wood when the socks struck the floor. Ethan cleared his throat, and with his bell-like voice, softly replied, “you’re right. I’m a submissive, little boy.”<br />
<br />
Eric nodded his head with approval, “and there is nothing wrong with that, bro.” He reached over and patted Ethan on the shoulder; his big bro started to tear up before gasping and racking with sobs. Eric pulled him in close and hugged him. “Let it all out; it’s okay. You don’t have to pretend around me.”<br />
<br />
“But I shouldn’t feel this way,” Ethan sagged with words. “I should be…”<br />
<br />
“Be whatever you want to be, Eth,” Eric interrupted. “You don’t need to impress anyone but yourself. If this is what you feel inside, then so be it.” He pulled away to consider his brother’s smooth skin and listened to his soft voice. “The only thing that’s changed is that what’s on the outside matches what’s on the inside. And there is nothing wrong with that.”<br />
<br />
“And, what about you?” Ethan asked with hesitation as he couldn’t help looking downward, feeling the big elephant in the room throbbing between them. <br />
<br />
Eric rolled his eyes with a smirk, “are you kidding me? This is great. I’m not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.” He looked sheepish as he whispered awkwardly, “honestly, I was always on edge for the moment you’d demand to take it back and keep it. And I’d never get to have it to myself ever again. And as for the rest of it,” he considered the hair across his skin and contemplated his voice, “we’ll chalk it up to puberty. But, at least it’s the weekend, so it gives us some time to make it believable.”<br />
<br />
“And uhm, if you want me to show you how to shave and deal with all that,” Ethan hemmed and hawed.<br />
<br />
Eric glared him into silence, “are you kidding me? I’m not shaving this off; I’m going to rock this look. And really, you shouldn’t have to hide who you are, express yourself. I’m sure I have some underwear that would look tight on you and show off what you’re working with,” Eric smirked.<br />
<br />
Ethan blushed again, “just because you like putting yourself on display doesn’t mean I do. And you can keep your underwear,” he leaned in close and whispered, “I already bought some stuff that fits MY package perfectly.”<br />
<br />
Eric smirked, “bought yourself tight undies? It sounds like you’re committed.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah…” Ethan smiled as he glanced up at Haylee, who smiled back with reassurance. “On quite a few things.”</p>
