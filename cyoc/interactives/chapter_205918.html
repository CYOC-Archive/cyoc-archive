<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stand there, thoughts warring with each other in your mind. On one hand, you really want to get off. Your cock was throbbing with intense need in your pants. On the other hand, too much longer in this body and you might end up stuck in it permanently. With the mental changes you’d had that brought you to Blake’s doorstep in the first place, what lingering effects would transforming into Hutch bring?<br />
<br />
Blake stared at you expectantly. The scruffy young football player that smelled so good. The one you’d just sucked off. The guy whose cum tasted so sweet.<br />
<br />
“I want...” You heard the words come from Hutch’s lips.<br />
<br />
Finally! You push all your will power into it, trying to cut through the pervy thoughts of the piggy middle-aged trucker.<br />
<br />
“I want ta…” Hutch licked his lips. “No…”<br />
<br />
No?<br />
<br />
“No?” Blake raised his brows. “Uncle Hutch, really, my friends are comin’ over soon, spit it out.”<br />
<br />
You wrestle with the thoughts running through Hutch’s mind, but you keep getting wrapped up in memories. Somehow, Hutch had become almost aware of you. The roughneck scratched his beergut and slapped it. It was an odd sensation, one you never experienced in your body-you were young and fit. Just like Hutch had been, once. While memories of drinking and growing fat on beer and fast food struck you, Hutch finished his sentence.<br />
<br />
“I want ya ta suck me off.” Hutch said firmly, hand giving his belly a quick rub, distracting you more as it descended past it to his fly. <br />
<br />
He unzipped it, his hairy cock flopping out. Musk wafted from sizeable nuts. You showered before you came over, but now it smelled like you’d worked all day. Memories of Hutch’s job of nearly thirty years struck you, but it wasn’t quite as effective. Mostly a monotonous blur. It did, however, put you at ease with the idea of being fifty.<br />
<br />
“Uncle, ya know I don’t suck cock.” Blake shifted in place.<br />
<br />
“Ya do it all the time with yer friends. Come on boy, give your uncle a good suck.” Hutch insisted.<br />
<br />
“Ya, but we’re family. You might be like that, but I ain’t.”<br />
<br />
Hutch smiled. “Ya sure boy? I know you’ve been eyeing me. Admiring how manly I am. Bet my musk has got you all horned up again.”<br />
<br />
Blake blushed and looked at Hutch’s cock, licking his lips.<br />
<br />
“Ain’t never seen such a nice, thick cock in your life, right? Ya wanna see what I taste like, donthcha?” Hutch pushed.<br />
<br />
As he spoke the words, they came true. Hutch’s somewhat average sized dick grew to a nice, thick eight inches, a vein worming down the shaft and throbbed faintly. Pre beaded at the tip of the well-formed dome. Even you would be tempted by it and felt oddly proud of your big cock. Hutch&#39;s big cock, you mean.<br />
<br />
You want to tell Blake to get out of the trailer, away from his perverted old uncle. But you couldn’t even wrest control of Hutch’s body. Worse, you <I>do</I> want Blake to suck you off, so it wasn’t like you were outraged. Hutch might be his uncle, but <I>you</I> weren’t. Hell, maybe Hutch’s mind was more like a Chinese finger trap. The more you struggled, the harder it was to get out. Let the horny old fuck have his fun and then turn back during the post-nut clarity phase.<br />
<br />
Blake finally gave in and dropped to his knees. Hutch grinned and grabbed the back of the handsome young man’s head, guiding it to his cock. The jock opened his mouth and engulfed the thick head of Hutch’s beautiful meat.<br />
<br />
You gasp at the feeling, one that you shared with Hutch. Nephew or not, he had a nice mouth. You were worried for a good minute there that Blake wouldn’t know what to do with your dick…Hutch’s dick…if he had it. But Blake was giving him some decent head, creating a nice gentle suction, bobbing slowly on your…Hutch’s dick.<br />
<br />
His head was bumping against the underside of your…Hutch’s gut. Hutch lifted it, letting Blake have better access. With more of your cock exposed, Blake began deepthroating you. <br />
<br />
Hutch. <br />
<br />
Deepthroating Hutch.<br />
<br />
“Yeah boy, that’s it. Bet you’ve sucked off a lot of cocks, huh?”<br />
<br />
Hutch felt Blake shiver, his sucking growing even better, like he knew exactly what he was doing. Blake’s beard was brushing against Hutch’s balls. You thought the cub-that Blake-was scruffy, but it felt like he was sporting a full beard now. Unfortunately, you weren’t in the position to enjoy it. Hutch&#39;s arms were starting to burn and ache with the effort of lifting his  heavy beer belly. Blake seemed to sense his discomfort and pulled off his dick.<br />
<br />
“Come on Uncle, let’s go get you a seat.” Blake guided Hutch over to his living room to a plush recliner.<br />
<br />
There was something off about Blake. Not just his beard, which was fuller than the teenage scruff he’d once possessed. His face looked different, more mature. It was still kinda hot, in a rugged way.<br />
<br />
“Sorry boy.” Hutch groaned, sitting back in the recliner and patting his beer belly. “I just got tired of lifting this fat ole’ keg of a gut.”<br />
<br />
As he spoke, his belly wobbled and swelled larger with each pat. The rest of his body thickened as another layer of chub appeared, torso rounding out, barrel-like. More memories struck you, of eating to excess, the beer belly no longer just from unhealthy eating choices and a job that lent itself to roadbelly. They were warm, comforting thoughts, and your mind relaxed, fully accepting the belly as yours. Hutch rubbed your big, hairy gut as it settled into existence. The rest of your body swelled with soft chub, growing thicker. Getting fat happened when you were fifty, you weren&#39;t too bothered by it.<br />
<br />
Hutch grinned to himself as the strange voice in his head went silent for the moment.<br />
<br />
Blake settled in between Hutch’s knees and spread them, pushing the fat that had begun to swallow Hutch’s cock down. His mouth resumed its wonderful work, making you-Hutch-moan.<br />
<br />
“Damn you’ve got a great mouth!” Hutch exclaimed, hand falling back on the boy’s head. Blake&#39;s lips plumped and his mouth immediately began moving in ways that hit all Hutch’s buttons. “Awww, Blake, it’s like you’ve been suckin’ mah thick cock fer years now.”<br />
<br />
The hair on Blake’s head vanished beneath Hutch’s hand and he found himself caressing a smooth, hairless dome. The roughneck groaned as his cousin nibbled on his foreskin expertly, knowing just what he liked. They were only a few years apart, and had been secretly fucking each other since they were teens.<br />
<br />
Blake glanced up, staring into his cousin’s eyes as he deepthroated him to the hilt. The skin of his face was weathered and worn, a far cry from the soft, smooth skin he’d possessed only a few seconds ago. Crow’s feet lined his eyes, brow furrowed with wrinkles. His beard was streaked with gray as was the horseshoe hair that ringed his head. His body was hairier and a bit pudgier, but he’d managed to maintain his figure well enough for a middle-aged man.<br />
<br />
Hutch hadn’t actually meant to do that. Not that he minded. You, on the other hand, were screaming. The perverted old fuck was destroying your crush! You desperately push to end the magic by speaking the words, but Hutch was currently getting sucked off by his hot daddy of a cousin. Lust made him stronger. You tried another tactic, just trying to say something like ‘Boy, I’m sure glad you’re 18 and just out of high school and definitely not my cousin or my nephew’.<br />
<br />
“Fuckin’ prude.” Hutch muttered.<br />
<br />
“Mmmph?” Blake asked.<br />
<br />
“Nothin’, Just thinkin ‘bout how glad I am thatchern’t my cousin or my nephew.” <br />
<br />
You watch Blake’s features change slightly, just enough that he looked nothing like Hutch. You cheer happily, hoping Hutch was going to cancel the spell-<br />
<br />
“Because it’d be too boring. I’m glad yer actually my identical twin.” Hutch grinned evilly. “ain’t that right, Butch?”<br />
<br />
You struggle, but the thought of fucking essentially yourself was growing very hot. Blake, now Butch, began to shift, hair pulling back into a gray skullet. His facial features shifted and Hutch found him staring down at himself sucking his own dick with a needy look in his own eyes. As Butch’s body swelled with fat from working with his brother and eating what he ate, you felt your mind become overwhelmed with fifty years of memories. You tried to stop them, hold them back, but you&#39;d already surrendered so much of yourself. <br />
<br />
You lick your lips and groan, bucking into your twin’s perfect mouth. Your own face tingles as your own mouth plumps into the same dick-sucking lips your brother has. You gasp as your balls swell and plump, matching your twin’s well-hung crotch. No! Hutch’s twin! He wasn’t….Your brother twirled his tongue and you moaned, clenching your toes in your work boots.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah, bro!” Hutch reached up, caressing his moob, fingers running through his matted chest hair, and played with his nipples. “Man, mah nips are so sensitive.”<br />
<br />
You gasp as your nipple thicken and protrudes under your pinching fingers, sending jolts of pleasure through you. The change reflected back onto your twin. You wanted to correct yourself...but why would you? You were already fucking yourself, essentially, like the filthy fucking pig your were. To be fair, there really wasn’t much left of you at this point, just an idea that this wasn’t how you were supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Hutch decided to clinch the victory.<br />
<br />
“Yer Hutch.” You find yourself saying. “I’m Butch.”<br />
<br />
Outwardly, nothing seemed to change, save Hutch reaching down and fondling your thick balls and giving them a squeeze. Inwardly, your entire life shifted from one sentence. What’s an identity if not a name? All fifty three years of your life altered. Whatever doubts you had about who you were vanished as your mind accepted it. As far as you were concerned, you were a fat, fifty year old trucker&#39;s...identical twin.<br />
<br />
You were Butch. <br />
<br />
You relax into the recliner, legs spreading wide. Your twin dove in with greater force. You moan happily, watching the tip of your dick disappear down your twin’s throat. Your hand rubs your big, furry gut, and tweaks a nipple. <br />
<br />
You felt your balls tensing.<br />
<br />
“Hutch.” You say. “I’m gonna-”<br />
<br />
Hutch vacuum sealed his mouth to your cock. <br />
<br />
You spasm, cum shooting down your twin’s throat, his tongue tickling the tip of your cock as he cleaned it. You panted happily, lying back and enjoying the afterglow. The magic clothing shifted, becoming a trucker&#39;s cap, denim coveralls and some enormous boxers, then the magic evaporated.</p>
