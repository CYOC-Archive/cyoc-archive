<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica looked at herself in the mirror, it was a small bathroom with only a toilet and a sink. It clearly hadn’t been updated in years, the dirt and grim was clear to everyone. However none of that mattered as Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. What was looking back at her wasn’t human at least not totally. <br />
<br />
Her eyes seamed larger and slit which was already unnatural enough but coming out of her short brownish black hair was a pair of very large pointed ears covered with black/gray fur with large.<br />
<br />
“What the?” inquired Jessica as she reached up and touched her ears, she looked at it in the mirror. First she moved to where her ears normally were only to find smooth skin, she moved up through her hair before touching the base of those large cat like ears. <br />
<br />
“This can’t be real….” Said Jessica her voice a little deeper as she felt a tugging sensation on her lips and nose. She closed her eyes for a moment, when she opened them again she was able to watch as her mouth and nose move forward and merge together into a short muzzle which quickly became covered with dark tan fur around her now cat like nose and white around her mouth. The fur quickly began to spread, darker gray around the upper part of her face while her mouth and lower cheeks covered with white fur. The fur was thicker and extended outwards around her jaw line. <br />
<br />
Jessica just stood there stunned, then she heard the sound of ripping as she felt her cloths getting much tighter and began to rip apart. She watched as she grew, going from an average 5’4 to what had to be at least 6 feet in height. She didn&#39;t know this but she was now stronger then any human had ever been and her skin would be able to take rounds from assault rifles like it was nothing. <br />
<br />
She stood there basically in the nude, her body now much larger and her face clearly some kind of cat. A cat similar but different then what she had just been fantasizing. <br />
<br />
She wanted to scream but part of her was enjoying it, she moved her hand to her bra which had stayed on but was extremely tight. She released her bra letting it fall away, as she did she watched with a smile as her bust grew in size. It actually wasn’t much larger then it had been when you grow it along with her increase in size but just knowing she had a larger bust caused a smile to form on her face. A smile which was now made of sharp fans. <br />
<br />
She cupped her breasts and let out a soft moan almost a purr as she felt her bust grow even more. She felt some pressure building on her stomach/rib cage. She looked at it in the mirror to see she was now ripped in the terms of muscles but there where also smaller bumps lining up. She watched before her eyes as small nipples formed. She reached down and touched them only to felt a surge of sexual pleasure. <br />
<br />
Snow white fur began to spread over her chest and stomach covering her breasts and those new smaller breasts, the smaller breasts were now almost invisible but she knew that she could feed many cubs. <br />
<br />
Fur covered her women hood before running down her inner legs before disappearing around her knees. The rest of her body quickly began to be covered with he same darker gray fur with multiple black spots mixed in. <br />
<br />
Her hands remained mostly human, however her fingernails turned into razor sharp claws which were able to retract into her hands. Her feet shifted a bit as larger thicker claws came in and grew larger which would make crossing snow covered fields far easier. She didn&#39;t know this yet but her claws could cut metal and she had the ability to outrun an Olympic gold medalist. A short tail grew out of her tail as she finished transforming.<br />
<br />
With the last sherds of humanity gone Jessica took a deep breath, she could smell everything nearby and she could hear everything as well. She felt more powerful and actually more beautiful then she ever had in her life. Two needs began to push to the front of her mind. <br />
<br />
To feed, she needed to hunt and to fill her belly. That was an animal like need. To spread this gift either by infecting or by having cubs but for that she would need a mate. <br />
<br />
She needed to do that the question was which one to do first and how to do it.</p>
