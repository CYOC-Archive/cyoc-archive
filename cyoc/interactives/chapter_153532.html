<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Seeing her new proportions made Rachel realize getting back into her clothes was going to be an interesting trial. Her shirt clung to her breasts tightly like a sports bra, she could actually hear some of the seams tearing as she forced it on. Next was her pants. Thanks to the stretchable material she pulled them over her wide hips, but they were looking more like a pair of shorts and only came down to her knees. This also left a very very clear outline of her half hard cock and balls. Rachel had to duck slightly to move through the doorway and walk down the hall to where she heard the other brother.<br />
<br />
As she walked down the hallway her body seemed to move in every way possible to make her more enticing. From the sway of her wide hips to the bounce of her F cups to the jiggle of her ass, she was rapidly becoming the absolute epitome of desire. Her long forked tongue licked her full lips in anticipation of her encounter with the new target. As she neared his room Rachel smelled the heavy scent of sweat and a smile formed on her face. The sounds of grunting and clanking of metal confirmed what Rachel expected the other brother was doing while she fucked Charlie. Holding the box behind her, Rachel knocked on the door. After no answer and the continued sounds of heavy exertion, she resolved to come in without an invitation. <br />
<br />
The other brother&#39;s room was in stark contrast to Charlie&#39;s room. Instead of science books and games and science fiction merchandise, this one had trophies lining the shelves and workout gear and not a book in sight. The scent of manly musk hung heavily in the air and turned on Rachel further, her dick pulling the tight material even tighter as it became erect. <br />
<br />
Laying on a bench press was Charlie&#39;s brother doing reps in the same shorts she saw him in earlier that day, his tank top laying discarded on the floor and giving Rachel a great view of his shaven, sweat soaked, chest. With each rep, she saw his bulging muscles ripple beneath his skin. Her pointed ears faintly heard music beneath the grunting and saw a pair of earphones on the hunk. Rachel walked a little further in and saw the man glance in her direction before doing a surprised double take and loose his concentration on his lifting, causing the barbell to slide down and pin to his chest. Clearly struggling, Rachel reached down and, much to both their surprises, lifted the barbell effortlessly with one hand and set it on its rack.<br />
<br />
The man coughed for a bit before catching his breath and looking at Rachel in both awe and suspicion. &quot;Who are you?&quot; He glanced at the outline of Rachel&#39;s cock. &quot;What are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, you&#39;re welcome by the way,&quot; she smiled. &quot;And I am here to offer you a fun time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out you freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel gave a fake pout and swayed her hips side to side, actually a little amused this man who only came up to her breasts would stand up to her. &quot;Aw, you don&#39;t want any of this beautiful body?&quot; She traced her free hand over her breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said get out! Charlie!&quot; He began to get up but stiffened as Rachel used the full force of her hypnotic gaze.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now open.&quot; She fed him a few submissive candies before putting the chocolate box down. She the ran a finger down his sweat covered chest, tracing the outlines of his defined muscles. &quot;I have special plans for you my Hercules.&quot; She cupped the vivid outline of his hardening member and was actually a little disappointed by it&#39;s size. &quot;Guess it&#39;s not all proportional, but we can fix that,&quot; an idea came to her mind and she gave a mischievous smile, &quot;and maybe double our fun. What&#39;s your name?&quot; She dismissed the hypnotic spell and Brad relaxed, his gaze lustful instead of angry like before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brad,&quot; he answered, his chest heaving with each deep breath as he caught his breath from his exercise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Brad, I&#39;m very impressed with your body.&quot; Rachel wiped off a small bead of sweat that was dangling from Brad&#39;s erect nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; he breathed, sucking in his gut and puffing out his chest as he smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;But are there any areas you want to be better at? Be the absolute best? Become the greatest without dispute?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad frowned at this and thought about it before he spoke. &quot;It&#39;s getting harder to make gains, and I want to get bigger. I want to be the strongest person in the world. My sports trophies are nice, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you want more. You want to be what everyone compares their strength to, to be the measuring stick for everyone else. It is only natural for you to want to be better than everyone else. And I can help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? How?&quot; <br />
<br />
Rachel was shocked as the words flowed out of her mouth so readily. &quot;We can make a bargain. I get to fuck that tight virgin ass of yours and in exchange, I&#39;ll grant you your greatest desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad, at first hesitant at the idea, but won over by the promise of becoming an actual Hercules, nodded slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then bend over and relax.&quot; Brad tuned around and braced himself against the workout bench. Rachel pulled down his shorts and boxers, revealing his throbbing cock. In a hurry to begin, Rachel grabbed her waistband and ripped her leggings off and letting her own member stand free. The spines along it&#39;s length pulsed excitedly and seemed to be leaking some sort of fluid, her own lube.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go easy on me, I don&#39;t have any lube.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a problem.&quot; Rachel reached forward and laid one hand on Brad&#39;s shoulder and the other on his hip to steady him. Steadily guiding herself to the waiting hole, she stopped right as the head pressed against Brad&#39;s asshole. And then she pushed, spreading him wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Watch it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I never said it was going to be painless, now relax!&quot; She pushed deeper and pulled out a little. Then thrust forward, going in deeper than before. As her thrusting continued to go deeper and deeper, Brad&#39;s pained grunts changed to gasps of surprise and moans of pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes! Yes! Fuck!&quot; Brad yelled and came as Rachel began to thrust faster and faster. <br />
<br />
Rachel was nearing her limit after her session with Charlie and felt her orgasm building. But it wasn&#39;t just her jizz that she felt building, something else was preparing to be unleashed from inside her. <br />
<br />
Finally she couldn&#39;t hold it back any more and let loose, feeling her dick throb and pulse inside Brad&#39;s tight hole as she filled him up. Whatever was building inside her relaxed and receded into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need more to release whatever that was,&quot; Rachel guessed and pulled out of Brad. <br />
<br />
Brad forced himself to remain standing and turned to face Rachel. &quot;Now for my wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you already have it. See?&quot; Rachel pointed to Brad&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
He raised his arm to look at it and saw the veins starting to pulse. With each pulse his arm&#39;s muscles bulged larger, like someone was inflating a balloon under his skin. The pulsing spread to the rest of his body and continued at an uneven pace. A thigh would bulge larger, then a deltoid, a pectoral, then the other thigh. Each pulse added to his impressive bulk. Brad&#39;s excited panting almost timed perfectly to the changes. And it wasn&#39;t just his muscles that was growing, he was getting taller and already was reaching Rachel&#39;s neckline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; he panted, his voice noticably deeper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, a deal is a deal. I hope you like this as well.&quot; She pointed to his dick, Brad was forced to look between the canyon developing between his pecs to see his cock growing wider much faster than it&#39;s length. Before he could question the change, the rod split in two to form a pair of dicks that had grown to 7 inches long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grr! I. Can. Feel. The. Power!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad shot upwards a few more inches, now towering over Rachel. With a thud, Brad&#39;s head hit the ceiling and forced him into his knees as his pulsing growth continued. Veins were starting to resemble large constrictor snakes as they pulsed beneath Brad&#39;s skin. His muscles were growing so fast, Rachel wondered if his skin might start to break if it couldn&#39;t keep up with his transformation into a real life hulk.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is real power!&quot; Brad&#39;s voice was sounding more like a roar than actual words. <br />
<br />
Rachel heard the sounds of wood breaking beneath Brad&#39;s growing bulk and thought now might be a good time to leave. She gathered her box of chocolates and, not caring if anyone saw her bare ass at night, walked out the front door. As she shut the door behind her, the sound of the second floor giving way rumbled through the house. <br />
<br />
&quot;He should be close to finishing his growth now. Then he&#39;ll pass out and sleep it off. I shall see you two tomorrow. Many things are going to change tomorrow for us all. Sweet dreams.&quot;</p>
