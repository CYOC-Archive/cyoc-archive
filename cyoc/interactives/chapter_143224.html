<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You paused as you put two and two together in your head and you asked,&quot;So, Zarsh is going to become a woman?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you before that I’m not sure how he runs things here, although it is the first time a woman has defeated a man in this tribe.&quot; She replied <br />
<br />
&quot;Son of a... how will everyone else see him... her, if he goes through with it?&quot; You asked clenching your hand into a fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... probably like everyone sees you, although you’d both be open to be bred, if any guy would grow a pair to try to breed with you.&quot; Tharss said,&quot;Though, with the loss of his pride... people would start challenging Zarsh more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He fights with strength instead of speed too... Damnit, I’ve gotta go stop this!&quot; You snarled,&quot;Where’s these sacred grounds?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tharss pointed in the direction of south,&quot;Follow the side of the trees where no moss grows, you’ll find it soon enough, but... are you sure he’s actually going to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tharss, I woke up this morning and he wasn’t there, despite what’s going to happen afterwards it’s also irresponsible for him to just leave like this! Arrrgh! Damn him, when I find him I’ll give him a piece of my mind and drag him back myself if I have to!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing your rage Tharss nodded to you and handed you her spear and said,&quot;Just on the off chance you’ll need it, if you travel at a running pace you should be able to catch up to Zarsh if he’s going out to the sacred grounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, thank you, will everyone here be able to hold out without a leader?&quot; You asked and Tharss shrugged and replied,&quot;We should be fine a day or two without someone around, just be sure to get back before someone realizes this isn’t one of Zarsh’s fabled solo hunting runs.&quot;<br />
<br />
You took a deep breath and sighed upon hearing this and replied,&quot;Let’s hope it’s only that, and not what I think it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
_________<br />
<br />
A few hours later...<br />
<br />
_________<br />
<br />
You trudged strenuously through the never ending marsh growing more furious with Zarsh by the second. &quot;What was he thinking?! That idiot would throw all of his responsibilities out just because of his pride?!&quot; You thought to yourself,&quot;I mean seriously, I could probably run that tribe better than he could, which also begs the question of WHY AM I OUT HERE?!&quot;<br />
<br />
You’d been asking yourself that for the longest time now as you’d love to see the other men at the tribe poke fun at Zarsh in a woman’s body while you sat back and watched. Although again something about Zarsh just being female made your blood boil like you had never felt before. You didn’t know if it was just anger that drove you at this point, but if it wasn’t anger then what else was it?!<br />
<br />
As you questioned your motivations you briefly imagined Zarsh and you sharing a bed, having his thick muscles curled around you, and his throbbing cock between your thighs.<br />
<br />
You stared off into space, but suddenly realized what you were thinking and growled thinking,&quot;Am I actually attracted to that bastard?! Do I... have a crush on him?!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then all that anger and rage shifted its focus back onto you, and you got so pissed that you threw your spear as hard as you could into the distance to blow off some steam. After a minute or two of deep breaths to calm down you sighed,&quot;I should probably retrieve that for Tharss.&quot;<br />
<br />
So you walked off through some bushes and saw your spear at the base of a large tree on a small stretch of mud that could loosely function as solid ground. But then you spotted the big green asshole himself, Zarsh, approaching the spear and pausing and looking back towards you with a puzzled look.<br />
<br />
Your gaze leered on Zarsh as you approached the tree and you crossed your arms over yourself breasts and hissed,&quot;Greetings.... husband...&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh paused and pulled the spear up out of the ground and commented,&quot;Great throw, were you aiming for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
You rolled your eyes and replied,&quot;If I was aiming for you, you’d be bleeding out. That’s definitely not why I’m here either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you did refer to me as husband for the first time, so I might as well give you my attention,&quot; Zarsh exclaimed casually then he handed over the spear, and leaned up against the tree then asked,&quot;What would you like to talk about?&quot;<br />
<br />
You pointed the tip of the spear at Zarsh’s head and growled,&quot;Don’t play dumbass, I know exactly why you’re out here! Since you lost you’re going to become a woman, aren’t you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh saw the furious expression on your face and he sighed,&quot;...Yes, is that a problem that I wish to establish a bit of pride for myself as something else? Even if it be as a mother to a clutch of eggs...&quot; <br />
<br />
Zarsh didn’t seem overly excited about the idea of becoming female, but that didn’t lessen things too much for you. &quot;You left me, left everyone in the tribe without a word! Do you know how irresponsible that is?! As a female you’d also probably get targeted specifically by others who want to challenge you for your position!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean like you challenged me?! I thought it’d be instinct for you to lead when I was absent, so to me that responsibility fell to you,&quot; Zarsh replied in a low and almost bitter growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t you dare use that tone with me!&quot; You snarled,&quot;How could it be my responsibility when everyone there still thinks you’re the leader?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I’ll just tell them I went out to do this instead of one of my fabled two day solo hunting expeditions,&quot; Zarsh replied and you groaned,&quot;Oh my god! You’re so insufferable!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh then walked up to you and said,&quot;It is tradition for males who loose their pride like I did to have the fate of becoming female fall to them to find a new kind of pride in something else, so let me uphold that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well from what I heard the tribe isn’t sure if you enforce that rule or not, and this is the first time this has happened!&quot; You snarled, &quot;You also didn’t think to I don’t know... tell me this was happening and talk about it beforehand?! I’m your damn wife!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you acknowledge this now of all times? Also if this is a concern about my leadership position then why is it only you who came and not a search party?&quot; Zarsh asked then squinted at you and hissed,&quot;What’s this REALLY about?&quot;<br />
<br />
You suddenly felt your confidence drop as Zarsh switched away from being defensive, and something about this made you worry that he’d catch onto how you felt. You tried to come up with a bullshit explanation, but only ended up spouting out gibberish which made Zarsh cross his arms and raise a brow at you. So without any other options, you threw the spear to the ground and lunged at Zarsh with all your might.<br />
<br />
Zarsh was caught off guard and he stumbled over his tail and onto his back as he tried to defend himself. However you weren’t attacking him, in fact you wrapped your arms around his big stupid head and passionately gave him the biggest kiss in your life.<br />
<br />
You closed your eyes and felt your forked tongue explore the insides of Zarsh’s mouth, between every tooth and over every surface. The taste and smell your tongue picked up we’re horrid, but you didn’t care at all as if you weren’t thinking at all. But as soon as you realized what you were doing with your hips grinding up to his pelvis, and your breasts squishing up against his chest, you froze and opened your eyes to see Zarsh in a state just as shocked as you were by your performance.<br />
<br />
You parted lips and put your hands on his shoulders blushing profusely. Then Zarsh grinned at you and chuckled before wrapping his hands around you and returning the kiss you gave him with his own lips, mouth, and tongue. You blushed even harder and Zarsh grinned and said,&quot;I think I found your weakness my beautiful sexy wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
You heard his deep voice take a seductive tone and you hissed back,&quot;Shut up, I’ll drag you back with your tail between my teeth if I have to... my bold but strapping husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn’t fight your passions any longer now that the secret was out, and Zarsh knew this and caressed your body from your breasts to your ass with his hand and placed a hand on your cheek and rubbed it. &quot;Heh, well how about this? You’ve certainly got me considering staying your husband, but... I’m not completely sealed on my decision. I could be persuaded though, if perhaps my lovely wife was a bit more... open with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
With this Zarsh unsheathed a burly cock that rubbed up against your folds with its tip. You blush grew even deeper with this, and even more so as Zarsh kissed the tip of your snout and said,&quot;You know you want it, don’t you? We’re all alone too, just you, me, and the sounds of us making miracles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot; You stammered as the thick rod teased your folds and you thought about how great it would feel to suck it, to ride it, to be mounted by Zarsh and it, and you just glared at him and grinned then growled,&quot;Do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh grinned at this remark and kissed you once more on the cheek then pushed you over onto your back and rolled himself up overtop of you, immediately thrusting his thick member into your feminine cunt with a growl. You hissed and moaned, taking hold of your breasts and massaging them in your hands as Zarsh pounded your tight womb. <br />
<br />
&quot;Urrrgh! Damn.... you really are tight!&quot; Zarsh snarled as he continued his thrusting motion, and all you thought of right now was him, in and out, over and over, until he fills you with his life essence.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-More!&quot; You hissed looking Zarsh directly in the eyes and he grinned, pounding you harder, but you weren’t satisfied. &quot;More!!&quot; You snarled again feeling the gap between him and you grow closer with every inch of his member your cunt swallowed as his balls slapped your ass and tailhole vigorously. Then all at once you screamed,&quot;Moraaaaagh!!&quot;<br />
<br />
You climaxed and screamed as loud as you could as you felt what was perhaps the most pleasurably satisfying feeling in your life as your juices spilled out emitting a strong and unmistakable scent. However that didn’t compare to moments later when Zarsh roared out loudly, and his cock released its entire load into your unprotected sex. <br />
<br />
The feeling was similar to having a hose of warm water forced inside of you and violently gushing out every last drop it could as your tight pussy clenched down on its shaft tightly. But then you remembered it wasn’t a hose, but the shaft of Zarsh’s masculine cock inside of you making you orgasm once more before you fell, exhausted and limp into the cool muddy ground.<br />
<br />
You panted heavily and Zarsh smiled, curling his tail around yours as he stared at you with a wide toothy grin on his face. &quot;You know what this means, don’t you?&quot; He asked licking your face as you blushed.<br />
<br />
You looked down and blushed suddenly realizing what this meant as well and looked up panting,&quot;P-Pregnancy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh nodded and smiled,&quot;Yes, and what a bountiful clutch it shall be, filled with future warriors and warrioresses. Our bloodline shall be filled strong and powerful warriors, perhaps even surpassing us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you mean me right?&quot; You giggled weakly and Zarsh sighed,&quot;I’ll never live that down will I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not until you find a way to beat me, although... I’m not sure we should fight too much in the future, especially with uh....&quot; You blushed imagining walking around with a swollen stomach, with everyone around you seeing your pregnant body, and lastly laying all those large round eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how big these will get,&quot; Zarsh said grinning and grasping one of your breasts to make you blush and you snarled and slapped him on the face as you snapped back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up perv,&quot; You hissed then crossed your arms,&quot;why do I even find you attractive?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Because maybe it’s instinct? Maybe you wanted a man and I was simply the most pleasing to you? Either way, I respect you for beating me in a fight, and you’re the toughest bitch I’ve ever fought!&quot; He growled with a smile and you rolled your eyes at him but then he started massaging your breasts, and you moaned in pleasure one last time as you looked back at him and felt him kiss your cheek again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That being said, you’re my wife, and I’m your husband,&quot; He said caressing your cheek with his hand,&quot;If we hide our affections it won’t last long, especially when your signs start showing. However, I shall give you as much as my love as you desire, whether it be as a simple display or an intimate act as kinky as you like~&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed then took a deep breath and sighed,&quot;You... bastard, I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you, my stubborn and short tempered wife,&quot; He replied with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; You paused and sighed,&quot;...did overreact a bit during the fight didn’t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You almost drowned me, but then again I call that fair trade in my tribe,&quot; Zarsh replied then he proceeded to pull out of you with a grunt and help you back to your feet.<br />
<br />
The two of you took a dip in the water to wash away any mud and then you looked to Zarsh and said,&quot;If you tell anyone about this I’ll make you regret it, you know that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zarsh shrugged,&quot;I imagine nothing less, although when the eggs start sprouting I imagine it won’t take long for others to realize what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it secret Zarsh, at least until then!&quot; You growled at him firmly and he chuckled almost unfazed by your anger and nodded. Watching this you paused and asked,&quot;When did you get the balls to just...&quot; You sighed after this and decided to restrict your anger for now and use it on something else later.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take pride in knowing that I just fucked the woman who I lost to in a fight, and climaxed after she did,&quot; Zarsh chuckled then wrapped his arm around your shoulder and cupped your left boob and teasingly said,&quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; You sighed and said,&quot;I love you too, let’s go home you big idiot.&quot; <br />
<br />
With this the two of you proceeded back to towards the camp and returned just as the sun was setting. That night you put your top back on and went out to return the spear to Tharss when you saw the men talking around a bonfire with Zarsh.<br />
<br />
You were surprised actually when one reached out and invited you in for some beer and food, although you paused as you also had female members of the tribe that you could talk too, Tharss included. You waved them off for now and walked off to return the spear wondering if they had opened up to you now because Zarsh said something or not.<br />
<br />
Ultimately as you figured out where Tharss lived you decided you wanted to spend the night...</p>
