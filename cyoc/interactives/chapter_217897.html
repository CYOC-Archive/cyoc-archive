<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tammy waddled behind Brianna and Gloria as the tubby trio made their way up through the halls of Shermer High as fast as they could...which wasn&#39;t very. Tammy knew she would be, like, totally late for getting them to class but was SUPER thankful and stuff that most of the teachers seemed to cut her some slack and that Mr. &#39;Drinkin&#39; Martinis&#39; Santini (Tammy always giggled at Rob&#39;s little joke) didn&#39;t seem to care. They passed row after row of lockers, only stopping three times for Gloria and Brianna to catch their breaths before they finally reached the Special Education room where Brianna and Gloria would spend the rest of the day.<br />
<br />
It sort of made Tammy jealous, cuz like, they did totes easy homework that little kids did why she had to do, like, normal school stuff? But then again, Tammy liked being able to sit in class next to her boyfriend all day (when he attended) and the rest of the girls that hung around his gang. Not a lot of students could say that they spent the entire day with their friends right? Even if those girls were a little mean, especially when Robbie wasn&#39;t around...<br />
<br />
Tammy knocked on the classroom door and smiled when the spinsterly Ms. Orville opened it, a look of relief on her face (Which to Tammy looked like one big wrinkle factory and she hoped that when she got old she didn&#39;t look like that or, ew, have like thinning white hair).<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Tammy, there you are. I was beginning to think if I should call Mr. Irons to go look for you. I know how you girls can sometimes get...distracted by things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, no big Ms. Orville! We just, um, walked a little slower today and stuff!&quot; Tammy said, giving the teacher her best smile as she stepped away from the door so that the miserable looking Gloria had enough space to (barely) fit through the classroom&#39;s entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry. I wanna go home.&quot; The dark haired, once pretty girl whined as took one ponderous thundering step forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will in a little bit, dear&quot; Ms. Orville said, guiding the worse off of her two larger students into the classroom and towards the specially ordered chairs the girls would sit in. Brianna plodded in behind but stopped to look at Tammy, her eyes large and watery as she tried to ignore the pain in her feet. There was something...something important she had to say to Tammy but...what?<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy I...um...&quot; The brown haired grease factory croaked, her brow furrowed dramatically as layers of flabby skin and thick, unattractive eyebrows pushed together. She HAD to remember! Remember what though...<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I guess I forgot&quot; She muttered after a moment of silence as the lone milk cartoon in her brain decided to fall over unprovoked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s okay! I like, totally forget stuff all the time also! I&#39;ll come get you at the end of the day okay?&quot; Tammy reached out and gave her charge&#39;s shoulder a squeeze, her hand sinking into the rounded fat of Brianna&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it was important&quot; The former male mumbled as she dejectedly waddled the rest of the way into the room towards the other reinforced chair that sat next to her best friend. She had to say something but each time her struggling brain seemed to grasp exactly what it was, the thought vanished again. &quot;Poop&quot; She said as she lowered her titanic rear end down into the chair, MS. Orville standing close by to offer support, if only verbally. She&#39;d learned last year that if one of the girls fell on her, she&#39;d end up trapped beneath flailing fat before the other students managed to pull whichever girl fell off her...And then she&#39;d end up in the hospital. Again.<br />
<br />
Tammy simply watched the scene unfold for a moment before turning and waddling off towards her locker, eager to retrieve her own marginal goods she needed for the day. It was little more than her purse, she didn&#39;t keep a backpack and the girls would just share the textbook and do all their work together. Her own textbooks were at home for doing her homework there...When she wasn&#39;t too busy cuddling with her red headed muscle man.<br />
<br />
The thought of being in his arms again made her special spot tingle and she hurried to her locked and put in the combination, using her little sing-song jingle that she had made to help her remember what it was after she, like, had to keep getting Mr.Kazinski to open it for her. And he looked creepy and old and kinda smelly and was totally grody looking even though he was nice for an old guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;First is three, then it&#39;s nineteen, then it&#39;s back to seven&quot; Tammy chirped and let out a &#39;yay!&#39; as the locker&#39;s handle lifted upwards and the small shrine to teenage femininity swung open. Most of the locker was filled with pictures of her and Rob, or flowers and cats...But Tammy frowned as she thought it was supposed to have, like, funny cartoons with jokes that were super hard for her to understand? And then before that wasn&#39;t there, um...<br />
<br />
Why would there be pictures of football teams in her locker? She didn&#39;t like football cause all the players and cheerleaders were me to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, that&#39;s just like, their problem&quot; She said to herself as she reached for the lime-green and heavily bedazzled purse that sat in the locker and contained her makeup kit, some wipes, cash for lunch, some pictures of her and Robbie and her mom and dad and like, her phone! And a tiny notepad that she used when she was supposed to remember something really important but didn&#39;t want it to get eaten by her numerous blonde moments. Tammy swung the purse around her shoulder and slammed the locker door shut, humming a wordless tune as she made her way back through the school towards the shop class, her thoughts largely focused on seeing her boyfriend again.<br />
<br />
But every now and then a thought poked through the funny feeling fogginess that seemed to perpetually cover Tammy&#39;s mind; What was Brianna trying to tell her that was important? Was it something to do with her parents? OR Willow? Or Gloria? Tammy was, like, pretty sure that Brianna and Gloria weren&#39;t ready for dating but she often wondered if the slightly smaller of the two obese girls had a crush on her larger counterpart.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be supes adorable&quot; Tammy said to no one but herself as she neared the shop class doors.<br />
<br />
But that...that didn&#39;t feel right. It was something bigger, larger, something regarding the future and all that nerdy junk and stuff...<br />
<br />
Tammy pushed the thought aside for a moment as she pulled open the shop class door an was treated to the dull roar of twenty students (most of which were affiliated with Rob and his gang) talked over one another while Mr. Santini simply had his office door closed and was staring at something mindless on the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s your cookie dough, Rob&quot; One of the boys...Jules, Tammy thought his name was, said, the black haired pale skinned boy pointing a finger past Rob&#39;s shoulder. Rob&#39;s slab like face turned as Tammy bounced in and leaned against him, her weight causing him to let out a quiet &#39;oof&#39; before he managed to adjust in his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed you...&quot; Tammy purred as she slid into her boyfriend&#39;s lap. They shared a quick kiss, but before Tammy was finished, her beau was pushing her off him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got work to do, babe. We&#39;ll finish this is a little bit, okay?&quot; Rob&#39;s voice was low and gruff, and Tammy tried not to feel hurt by the tone because she knew that was his &#39;work&#39; voice. Instead she just nodded dumbly and waddled off to where the rest of the girls that &#39;belonged&#39; to Bolstrum&#39;s Bullies sat; the front row of long drafting tables that had been pushed together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, here comes the &#39;Queen&#39; in ALL of her majesty&quot; The pug-faced Marcy barked, and the rest of the &#39;Slut Court&#39; broke into witchy cackles and shrieked guffaws as the dumb, but otherwise well-to-do blonde took her place in the collection of punk-clothed girls.<br />
<br />
Tammy hated when Marcy chose to come to school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, hi to you too Marcy&quot; Tammy said with as much friendliness as she could. Out of all the girls in the group, Marcy was the one that she got along with least, and the ugly girl often spent a lot of time, at least when Rob was otherwise occupied, making Tammy feel uncomfortable. There were a lot of jokes about her weight but she, like, tried not to care. After all, her Robbie was the king of the bullies and got to do whatever he wanted and so if she was umm...jealous! Yeah, if Marcy was jealous then it was just too bad that Robbie loved Tammy. She could just, like, kill the ugly girl with kindness. That&#39;s what her mom always told her to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, like, totes super whatevs GF! KISS&quot; Marcy said with another sneer and made a kissy face at Tammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, sure. Kiss kiss&quot; She mumbled as she pulled out her phone and notebook and tried her best to lose Marcy&#39;s attention as the rest of the girls laughed at Tammy&#39;s expense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh, ya gonna write somethin&#39;? You know you&#39;re not supposed to overstress that pretty head of yours! Oh now, should I get Martini Santini? I think I see smoke coming out of your ears Tammy!&quot; Marcy crooned again, and Tammy just buried herself in her phone. She wasn&#39;t going to fall for that again. She just had to ignore Marcy and eventually the girls would go back to talking about, like, whatever.<br />
<br />
That was when the thing she had been trying to remember, the, like, really important thingy! Tammy grabbed the sparkly feather-topped pen from the depths of her purse and began scribbling it down so that she wouldn&#39;t forget again.<br />
<br />
Brianna&#39;s real name name is...<br />
<br />
Option 1: Tammy forgets again, and spends the rest of the day struggling to recall what it was, eventually shrugging it off entirely as she had other, more fun things to do.<br />
<br />
Option 2: Bill! Tammy manages to write down a VERY rough recollection of the morning&#39;s events before the fateful wish that stranded the three of them as dull-witted, overweight girls, and vows to use the shiny green rock they&#39;d left at the Strasserman house to do...something. It was VERY important to all of them. Maybe her Robbie could help figure it out?</p>
