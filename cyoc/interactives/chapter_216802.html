<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ohh emm gee... It’s like a unicorn vomited a rainbow on candy land.”  The boys stood in the doorway of Scotty’s room, looking in at something Jeffy found nearly incomprehensible.  “I feel like I’m going to get diabetes just looking at it.  This is…”<br />
<br />
“Amazing,” Scotty finished with a smiled, his eyes sparkling like a child&#39;s on Christmas.”  Jeffy looked up at his tall, beefy, hairy muscle-jock football bunny boyfriend with incredulity.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?”  Jeffy was completely confused.  “How did you turn back to a jock so fast?  You were my shrimpy little bunny bitch a second ago.”<br />
<br />
Scotty shrugged with his crooked grin.  “We got smart again, remember?”  He lifted his wrist, pointing with a finger to the pink band with red hearts on it, as if it was self-explanatory.<br />
<br />
Jeffy looked down at his own wrist.  Sure enough, his Chronivac was pink with little red hearts too.  They must have changed them during ‘stupid time’.  “Okay.”  Jeffy looked into the room again.  Then much to his shock, Scotty stepped into the rainbow maelstrom.  “Wait!” Jeffy called after him, grabbing Scotty’s dangling red leash so that he wouldn’t fall in.<br />
<br />
That’s when the second incomprehensible (relatively speaking) thing happened that day.  Instead of falling into what looked impossibly like several entire worlds superimposed upon one another – vast lands of rainbows and butterflies and balloons and candy castles along with a thousand other images that simply couldn’t exist at once in such a small space as Scotty’s bedroom… Scotty somehow ‘grabbed it all’.  No, it wasn’t a poster, it was some kind of actual world or reality…yet the football jock with a pink bunny tail pushed it all impossibly into his closet, muscles bulging, and closed the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;No hidden metaphors there,&quot; Jeffy said, wide-eyed, not understanding what he had just seen or what had just happened.<br />
<br />
The big, hairy jock turned, slapping his hands together, pink bunny ears shaking some sparkles off.  “It was completely safe, you can come in.”<br />
<br />
“Uh… Okay.&quot;  Jeffy stepped into his boyfriend&#39;s room, tentatively.  The room was still quite different than two days ago.  Nearly everything in it was pink and frilly, and sports memorabilia had been swapped out for lots of pillows and stuffed animals.  “Wow… it’s like it was decorated by Hello Kitty.”<br />
<br />
Scotty raised his hand to his pink collar, grabbed his red leash.  “I configured the Chronivac settings so no police will be breaking down the door.  Clearly you’re the one with power over me, anyway.”  Scotty grinned.<br />
<br />
Jeffy realized he was still holding Scotty’s long leash.  “My… bunnyboi?”<br />
<br />
Scotty pulled his boyfriend over to him by  the jock’s own leash.  Jeffy looked up into his big, strong hairy jock boyfriend’s face.  With the collar.  And the bunny ears.  And makeup.  And a pink Chronivac with hearts… and a cute little Tupper wear tattoo with a little red heart inside it on his chest.  And another of a cute little animal on his bicep, and hoop earrings and nipple rings, pink highlighted long, pretty blonde locks curling down his shoulders and back, some of it put up in a man-bun at the top of his head – with a punk scrunchie, no less.  Jeffy put his arms around the muscle-hunk, and sure enough there was still a bunny tail above his butt, too.  Scotty put his hand on Jeffy’s shoulder, and Jeffy noticed colorful pink designs on his finger nails.  “Manicures?”  It was a strangely masculine-sounding word to describe a typically feminine paint job.<br />
<br />
“Pedicures and matching ankle bracelets too,” Scotty beamed down at his boyfriend with sparkly, smiley eyes.  “We’ve been VERY busy little bunnies.”  He kissed his boyfriend gently on his soft, full lips.  “You know... I kinda lost touch with my feminine side, I was so deep into sports.   But I&#39;m kinda glad I got back in touch with it.  I don&#39;t mind being your &#39;bunnyboi&#39;, so long as I can do football too.”<br />
<br />
“I can see it now, ‘bunnyboi scores a touchdown’,” Jeffy joked.<br />
<br />
“I’m being serious.” Scotty looked a little hurt and embarrassed.  “I liked it... feeling... pretty.  I mean, you&#39;ve always been the pretty one... and I know I’m supposed to be big and tough, but I kinda liked being the pretty one for a change, too.”<br />
<br />
“Oh baby,” Jeffy got apologetic, playing with his boyfriend’s long, blonde hair.  “I didn’t mean it that way.  I mean, I honestly always thought you were the pretty one anyway – because you always have been pretty as well as being big and tough.  You&#39;ve always been pretty to me.”<br />
<br />
Scotty smiled, taking Jeffy&#39;s hand and kissing it.  “I always thought you were the pretty one, because you are.  You’re just so amazing to me.”<br />
<br />
“I want you to feel as pretty as you already are, baby,” Jeffy said.  “Please keep the hair and all of this, if it helps - I like it and if you do too there’s no reason you can’t pick and choose the best of both worlds.”<br />
<br />
“You too, sweetie,” Scotty said.  “Whatever makes you feel as amazing as you already are, I want you to have without regret.”<br />
<br />
They hugged close, and Jeffy felt Scotty’s massive, veined cock nudging against him.  Jeffy giggled, stroking Scotty’s pretty hair some more, “Okay, my beautiful boy, how can you possibly be horny still after two days of marathon fucking?”<br />
<br />
“How can you possibly be wet still?” Scotty grinned.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s easy,” Jeffy felt the familiar warm tingling deep between his legs.  “I’m an insatiable pussyboi, remember?”<br />
<br />
“I like your new tattoos,” Scotty was grinning a little too much, and nearly lost it.<br />
<br />
Jeffy looked down.   Above his heart, in pink flowery writing it said, ‘Scotty’s little bitch-bunny’.  He looked lower, and above his pussy, in the same pretty lettering, ‘Scotty’s cock lives here’.  “Oh fuck,” Jeffy said, suddenly feeling embarrassed, yet turned on more too.  “What does it say across my shoulders?”<br />
<br />
“Insatiable pussyboi slut.”  Scotty laughed and Jeffy turned red.  “You should see the tramp-stamp.”<br />
<br />
That prompted a memory, and Jeffy got a big grin this time.  “You should see YOUR tramp stamp, my little ass.”  He laughed, squeezing his boyfriend’s strong, hairy glutes.  Then he remembered something and tensed up.  Scotty looked down at him, sensing his boyfriend’s tenseness.  “Hang on a sec, gotta check something.”  Jeff’s eyes focused on something else, and Scotty knew Jeffy was using the Chornivac.  “Oh, thank god.  The safety is still on, I was afraid I might have changed it.”<br />
<br />
Scotty looked confused for a second, then realized, “Ah, not pregnant.”<br />
<br />
“Not that it would be a bad thing,” Jeffy’s face softened.  “I would love to have your children, when the time is right, baby.”<br />
<br />
“Aww,” Scotty kissed is boyfriend, picking up the smaller man in his strong, muscular arms.  “When the time is right, I’ll be happy to keep you barefoot and pregnant, sweetie.”<br />
<br />
The two boys kissed some more.  Jeffy loved the feeling of being in his big, strong football jock’s muscular arms again, pressed against his beefy, hairy chest.  “So, we gonna talk about the unicorn in the closet?”<br />
<br />
“Later,” Scotty laughed when Jeffy’s pink bunny ears flattened back.  The football jock gave his boyfriend a long, passionate kiss.  “God, you really are pretty.”  He played with one of Jeffy’s nipple rings.  “You should keep these, they’re sexy on you, bunnyboi.”<br />
<br />
Jeffy laughed, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re a &#39;bunnyboi&#39; too, donk.&quot;  The twink and the jock were quite a sight with all the changes they had made to themselves and one another.  He had to admit, it was a turn-on seeing his Greek-god of a boyfriend adorned with all the girly, twinkish trappings.<br />
<br />
Jeffy made a decision to keep all the changes they had made during ‘stupid time’, except perhaps the bunny parts.  He also decided to surprise Scotty with something else while they made love.</p>
