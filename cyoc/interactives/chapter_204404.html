<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nina sighed, wiping her brow as she now made her way towards the kitchen. Being pregnant with twins and approaching 50 had left the woman far more drained than her previous pregnancies. Even with Jacob helping around the house, Nina still found herself needing to nap far more frequently than she was accustomed too. The smell of dinner now drew a contented smile onto the womans face. &quot;Dinner smells great honey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob glanced towards his wife, a small smile on his face. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said. &quot;Cooking up some of my famous BBQ. Know you&#39;ve been having cravings lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These two can&#39;t seem to get enough,&quot; she chuckled, patting her very pregnant stomach. &quot;But still honey, you cooked enough to feed an army. You know the boys have been spending most of their time away from home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plenty of leftovers then,&quot; Jacob grinned. &quot;Means less time I&#39;ll spend cooking and more time doing other things.&quot; Nina laughed softly, placing a gentle kiss on her husband&#39;s cheek. The couple now paused as the sound of a car now drew their attention. The Morelands weren&#39;t expecting anyone, Jacob now narrowing his eyes in concern. As the couple watched the occupants exit the car, Jacob could only smirk. &quot;Sorry honey but don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have any leftovers tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rri and Nat now glanced over the Moreland home in wonder. The last time the girls had been here was prom night. At the time they hadn&#39;t really gotten a good look at the farm, the two teens now astonished by the size of the small farm. &quot;You two love here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah this our place,&quot; Connor stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;So cute a farmhouse,&quot; Midna squealed. &quot;So do you do farm chores Spark? Like milking cows or feeding chickens or oh oh planting the fields!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Spark groaned. &quot;Its not like that, geez, I&#39;m not some hick Midna. I usually just help with some house work if I&#39;m not working with Caleb.&quot; Midna appeared disappointed, the purple haired womans shoulders slumping as her sister Star now grinned. &quot;Dont let little Spark upset you,&quot; Star smiled. &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s just being modest. She&#39;s probably just being modest about her milking skills.&quot; Spark now grit her teeth, glaring at the orange haired woman. Before she could answer, she now noticed Jacob exit the house. The elder hunter smiling as he approached Nova. &quot;Well this is a pleasant surprise. Good to see you Nova.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its good to see you too Jacob,&quot; Nova smiled, hugging the hunter before sadly glancing at his missing arm. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampire assassin,&quot; Jacob scoffed. &quot;Tore my arm off. Would&#39;ve been a goner if your daughter here hadnt rushed me to the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Little Spa&#39;kalth has always been an exceptional field medic,&quot; Nova stated with pride, causing Spark to blush. &quot;I&#39;m glad your okay though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob thanked her turning to Spark, Connor, and their friends. &quot;So you two want to introduce me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad this is Rei, Nat, Miles, and Miranda,&quot; he stated. Jacob nodded, looking Rei and Nat over thoroughly. &quot;We met before didn&#39;t we,&quot; he asked. &quot;The damphir girl. The one that babysits for the Harris&#39;s.&quot; Nat nodded, the two teens giving the elder hunter a timid wave.<br />
<br />
&quot;So your a demon hunter,&quot; Miles asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Retired hunter,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;My eldest kinda took over the reigns but Connor here has been helping out. That how yall met?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that,&quot; Miranda said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Nova what brings you round here,&quot; Jacob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when I found out about Spark and your son I felt the need to see you,&quot; she said. &quot;Its a rare and wonderful thing, even Queen Glitter was excited about to hear of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Queen Glitter,&quot; Spark exclaimed. &quot;The queen knows I&#39;m dating Connor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you think I came with mom little sis,&quot; Star smirked. &quot;I mean I am a trusted member of the queens council. Who better to give a report to the queen than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you&#39;re just as humble as ever,&quot; Spark grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls now is not the time for squabbling,&quot; Nova stated. &quot;This is a happy event. Now let us go inside, I am very much looking forward to catching up with Jacob and Nina.&quot; As Nat in the others now filed inside, they gazed around the Moreland home, surprised by what they saw. <br />
<br />
While Nina had decorated the hone in a country motif, it appeared Jacob had begun to add his own touches. Rei, Nat, and the Desotos noticed a trophy room off to the side. Quickly glancing in they noticed a wall of firearms as well as an extensive book case. Most alarming of all though were the trophies. The four teens noting the stuffed and mounted taxidermy statues of various monsters and mythical creatures.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap,&quot; Miles whispered. &quot;Is that the creature from the Black Lagoon?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gill man to be exact.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fourbteena turned, gasping in shock as they stared up at an 8 foot living statue. &quot;Oh my God what are you,&quot; Miranda exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;A golem,&quot; Daphne stated. &quot;Names Daphne and the trophy room is off limits for now. Now please make your way to the kitchen, dinner will be ready shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Making their way into the kitchen, the teens now took their seats, listening intently as Nova, Jacob, and Nina dominated the conversation.<br />
<br />
Nova had known the Moreland family for over a century, acting as Jacobs grandfathers personal fairy years ago before settling down.  After her retirement, she had remained in close contact with the Morelands, having known Jacob most of his life. This was how Spark had found her way onto the Morelands employ.<br />
<br />
Spark was the middle child of five siblings. Midna and Star being the two eldest while Spark had two younger brothers. Midna, the eldest daughter, appeared to be quite calm, if a bit ditzy. Rei and Nat learning the purple haired fairy worked at a fairy run magic shop with the realm of the fairies. <br />
<br />
Star, the orange haired second oldest, was a polar opposite to her more laize faire sister. A very serious (by fairy standards) Star worked for the Faory Queen, acting as her advisor. As the teens listened, they also learned she was close in age to her sister Spark as well as very competitive with her little sibling.<br />
<br />
Throughout dinner, the teens noted to two trading barbs in a sisterly manner. The rivalry between the two exceptionally strong as they glowered at one another. Nova, on more than one occasion giving the two a stern look. For the teens though they couldn&#39;t help get the impression that Star was a little jealous of all of Sparks adventures.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Nina how is the pregnancy progressing,&quot; Nova asked. Nina now glanced down at her stoma h, tenderly placing a hand upon her baby bump. &quot;Smooth sailing so far,&quot; she said. &quot;Dr. Harris has been tremendous and it helps having some wizard friends to make sure the babies are healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the girls,&quot; Spark interrupted. &quot;You know its girls right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont know about that one Spark,&quot; Jacob stated. &quot;Morelands are famous for having boys. Few more monthes and we get to say hi to baby Chase and Charlie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually,&quot; Nina smirked. &quot;You&#39;re both right. When I went to see Dr. Harris I asked her about the babies sexes. Turns out it&#39;s a boy and a girl, so looks like its going to be baby Chase and baby Charlotte.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A girl,&quot; Jacob gasped. &quot;Your having a girl. Nina, thats incredible! A baby girl wow!&quot; The elderly hunter now paused, sheepishly rubbing his neck as he gazed at his wife. &quot;I have no idea how to take care of a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll figure it out,&quot; Nina chuckled. &quot;And she&#39;ll have three brothers making sure she&#39;s okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations Nina,&quot; Nova stated. &quot;A thousand blessings upon your children. However, I need to ask of something regarding Spark and Connor if that is alright.&quot; Nina nodded, giving her approval as the fairy now turned to Connor and Spark. The two teens now fidgeted in place as Nova flashed a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;After hearing of yours and Connors relationship Spark,&quot; she said. &quot;Queen Glitter asked that I invite you to her palace to meet her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on Glitter wants to meet us,&quot; Spark exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep you&#39;ve been summoned little sis,&quot; Star smirked. &quot;I gave her my personal guarantee that you would show up. And be on your best behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sparks not in trouble is she,&quot; Connor asked. &quot;Of course not,&quot; Nova chuckled. &quot;But the union of a humam and fairy is quite rare. Queen Glitter would very much like to talk with you two. As well as your friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait us,&quot; Rei exclaimed. Nova nodded, studying the four teens that were now gawking at the woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would certainly say so,&quot; Nova stated. &quot;Spark has always been well thought of amongst our people. Not too many of our people often venture beyond our borders, especially to assist a demon hunter. Queen Glitter would very much enjoy meeting those she considers friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teens now stared at one another, realizing whether they wanted to or not they were going to be taking a very surreal trip very soon.</p>
