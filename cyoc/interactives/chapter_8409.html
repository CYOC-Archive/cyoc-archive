"Tim!  Saul!  Goddamnit guys, you in here?!!"</p>

<p>
The shout of Scott's voice boomed through the house and gave Timothy pause.  Already moving slowly due to his mammothly oversized genitalia, the fox stopped his steady pace towards his bedroom and considered his actions.  When Scott had come in, he'd clearly not recognized either himself or Saul.  So what <i>had</i> Scott thought?  That giant animals had gotten into Timothy's home?</p>

<p>
The fox sighed, steeling himself and turning back around.  It was certainly possible.  If <i>he</i> had come upon a humanoid fox and rabbit so suddenly -even when that fox was five foot eight- he'd probably have thought that animals had gotten into the house...  It wasn't like werewolf-style critters were everyday sights.</p>

<p>
"Damnit, Saul!  I saw you come in here from out back!  I...I need some help!"</p>

<p>
Timothy came to the top of the stairs.  If Scott was calling for Saul then that meant the rabbit was probably hiding somewhere ... possibly having slipped out again to the office, in back.  He looked down at himself, self-consciously.  His massive penis hung almost to his ankles, nearly as thick as his thigh.  His balls, too, were mammoth enough to give him pause:  each one was almost basketball-sized and made walking extremely difficult.  The fact that he'd run away from Scott in the first place was probably only due to Scott's shock at seeing two giant animals in the kitchen.</p>

<p>
Sighing, Timothy steeled himself and started downstairs.  <i>Great,</i> he thought, <i>someone </i>else<i> who has to find out about the damn box...  I just hope he didn't damage it when he knocked it on the floor...</i></p>

<p>
Meanwhile, however, Saul just stared, hidden behind the chair.  He couldn't blame Scott for pulling off his pants in the middle of his boss' living room.  Heck, even if most of the guys working for Timothy weren't gay, the bulk of them had been chosen to work here because of the freedom their boss-man gave them about their lives.  Sick-leave was virtually uncontested and each man got quite a bit of time off for "mental health" days, as well.  Thus, when the rather understandably disconcerting event of having your cock start to grow out of your pants occurred, it would probably be acceptable to Timothy that one of his workers whipped it out to prevent any tight-constraint damage...</p>

<p>
Scott, however, was not thinking of that.</p>

<p>
He'd already called out to Timothy and Saul, holding himself up as he started to get hard while he grew.  In fact, it might have been just Saul's imagination but even taking into account his steadily diminishing size as a humanoid rabbit, Scott's cock looked as if it was getting bigger, faster, than Timothy's had!</p>

<p>
The burly man sitting on Timothy's couch had always had rather copious hair on his chest, arms and legs so he'd had with him the bearish reputation of being rather virile.  But now, he was looking even hairier and his "equipment" was truly getting gigantic.  In the five minutes since he'd knocked the box over and accidentally triggered it, the trim, muscular man's cock had tripled in size to a whopping twenty-four inches long!  The thing was, it was also getting thicker, along with his balls getting heavier...</p>

<p>
Scott's cock, from what the shrinking rabbit saw initially, had been long and thin.  Now, however, it was nearly a fifth of it's overall length in thickness and getting thicker, faster!  His balls, too, while having been the size of large eggs initially, were now swollen to the size of small honeydew melons...</p>

<p>
"Scott!"</p>

<p>
Timothy's voice echoed down the stairs and made Saul jump.  His heart racing, the shrinking rabbit tried to remind himself that the instincts that were coming with this body needed to be resisted.  Timothy may be a fox but he wasn't <i>really</i> going to hunt him!</p>

<p>
Looking up at the base of the chair, Saul shivered.  He was only about half-again the height of a normal rabbit standing on its hind legs, now ... just over a foot and a half tall!  If he kept shrinking...</p>

<p>
He shivered at the thought but was brought back to the tableau by Scott's reply to Timothy.</p>

<p>
"Tim?  God, man; that you?  I ... I've got a problem!"</p>

<p>
He sure did.  He now couldn't hold both balls in his one hand as he leaned over the table, supporting them and feeling his cock rub against his chest.  He also looked ... different.</p>

<p>
"Scott; look, Saul's down there, somewhere ... maybe out back.  But ... but you've got to promise not to freak out.  I'm ...we're... different, now..."</p>

<p>
"What do you...?"  Scott trailed off, realizing that something else was happening.  He could hear Timothy's footsteps on the stairs, coming down, but even that, coupled with the strange sound of his boss' voice, couldn't distract him from what he was seeing in front of himself.  "Oh, shit...  What's happening to me...?"</p>

<p>
His arms, legs and body were all being covered with heavy fur as his sex, now swollen to full hardness continued to grow.  His muscles  also looked to being slowly overtaken by soft layers of flab ... his body getting a bit softer, while staying strong, as he changed.</p>

<p>
Timothy came slowly down, holding his mammoth cock in his hands as he peered over the railing to see his employee.  Scott was changing, too, as he'd guessed but -instead of just one change- he was changing in several ways.</p>

<p>
Not only was his sex getting bigger but his body was also filling out and getting rounder as his body changed, being covered with a dark brown fur.</p>

<p>
"I'm right here," said Timothy, behind Scott.  "But before you turn around..."</p>

<p>
Scott turned around from where he sat on the couch.  His eyes, now surrounded with rings of black fur, grew wide as he peered up at the super-sexualized fox on the stairway.</p>

<p>
"Tim...?"</p>

<p>
The owner of the salvage yard nodded and blushed.  "Uh, yeah...  Saul's here too, somewhere...  Saul?  Can you hear me?"</p>

<p>
"Uh, yeah..." came the squeaking reply from behind the chair.</p>

<p>
Both men looked as a small, foot-tall humanoid rabbit stepped out with an embarrassed blush on the insides of his ears.  "I ... I think the chest has gone haywire..."</p>

<p>
Scott stood up, his pants falling around his ankles.  He almost pitched forward from the weight of his balls and cock while his shirt filled out and stretched over his growing belly and chubby arms.  "What the hell is goin' on here?" he demanded.  He looked stunned as the voice that came out of his mouth now sounded very different.  He put his paw-like hands to his face and felt his nose and mouth now mounted on a short, rounded muzzle.  He quickly let his hands roam around his face and looked at his body in stunned silence.</p>

<p>
Timothy slowly walked down the rest of the stairs to enter the living room.  Saul walked out from behind the chair and slowly half-hopped/half-walked up to the other two, still keeping some of his instinct-inspired distance.</p>

<p>
Scott turned to the other two.  "What's happening to me?!!"</p>

<p>
Timothy swallowed and couldn't answer.  Scott was as hot as ever but -under the circumstances- despite how horny he and the other two might be, he just couldn't think of what to say.</p>

<p>
Saul spared him the task.  "You've changed," the tiny rabbit said, simply.  "From the looks of it, you triggered several effects from that chest at once ... you're now a sexually huge, chubby raccoon..."</p></p>
