<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian squeezed John once more, then stepped back. The orc's cock slipped off his chest and bobbed in mid-air. Brian bent forward and kissed the head slowly and deliberately. John swallowed and closed his eyes, focused on the sensation, and waited...<br />
<br />
... but nothing happened. A few seconds later he opened one eye, then the other, half-expecting to find Brian looking up at him in amusement. Instead, he was studying John's penis, his gaze running up and down it as though trying to memorize the image.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do I pass the inspection?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian looked up at him and grinned, but didn't answer directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is it so green? OK, the rest of you is greenish, but this is really dark.&quot;<br />
<br />
John shrugged, his arm and chest muscles rippling. &quot;I don't know; it just is. Maybe my blood's green?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be kind of weird. And what's this fuzzy thing at the bottom? It feels nice to pet, really smooth,&quot; Brian said, stroking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, can't argue with that,&quot; said John, distracted. He curled his toes, claws digging into the carpet. After a moment he realized Brian was still waiting for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sheath. Uh, it's a sheath. Covers up my cock when it's soft. Like a thing. Sword. Like a sword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like a claymore. It's sensitive, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just little.&quot;<br />
<br />
John felt Brian's hands move down to inspect his crotch, running through his coarse pubes and probing around the base of his dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;You must have really strong muscles down here just to hold it up like that. It's long, it's heavy, and all that leverage... Yeah, you're all tense here. Abs and buns of steel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian moved further down to his scrotum. John couldn't see what his room-mate was doing, but it felt like he was running his hands all over them, then cupping the balls in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez, these things are huge. How much do you, y'know, produce?&quot;<br />
<br />
John grinned. &quot;Wait and see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, OK.&quot; A pause. &quot;Is it my imagination or are they... moving?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You feel that too? Like a vibration? I guess it's real then. I dunno what it is exactly, but they seem to be stuck in overdrive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor orc has blue balls. Or green balls, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother, you don't know the half of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian went quiet for a bit, then asked: &quot;Don't they get in the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, uh, they can be a bit distracting when having serious conversations with naked men, sure, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, I mean physically. You've got two big, heavy balls in a loose sac that practically hangs to your knees. How do you run without nutting yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, first, they don't go to my knees; they're, like, barely half-way down my thighs. Second... huh. You know, I have no idea. I was running for a bit earlier on and it was fine, but I wasn't really paying attention. Other than that I haven't tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, seriously? That's the only time you've ever run?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As an orc, yeah.&quot; Then it clicked. &quot;Shit, you didn't know, did you? This only started a few days ago. Suddenly, bam, I'm turning into an orc and back. Mostly from, uh, sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian stood up and stared at him. &quot;Really? What made you like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, and I have no idea. I'm guessing it's something that happened on Friday night, but I hardly remember anything.&quot; He frowned. &quot;I think I was at this bowling alley, and I might have had sex, but it's all just this blur, like a dream.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sex seems to figure a lot, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
John grinned and gestured at his cock. &quot;Yeah, it's pretty much my primary motivation when I'm like this.<br />
<br />
Brian grinned back at him and stroked it. &quot;OK, I can take a hint. Hold on, I'll get some lotion.&quot;<br />
<br />
He came back with a big bottle of moisturiser, blushing. &quot;I have this because my skin gets dry, you see, not for, uh... although, yes, I do occasionally use it for other things. And it's more economical to buy in bulk. OK, other things more than occasionally. Sometimes. Um, a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
John smiled at him and cupped his cheek with an oversized hand. &quot;Hey, don't worry. Believe me, I'm not going to judge you about your sex life.&quot; This earned him a smile and a kiss on his palm.<br />
<br />
Having a jumbo-sized bottle turned out to be a good thing. John stood there as patiently as he could while Brian took a big dollup, rubbed it on both hands, smeared it on a portion of his dick -- he squirmed in delight, it was cool and slick and Brian's hands felt great -- and then went back to the bottle for more. After the third time Brian had got him lubed up to just below the head, and he was starting to worry he'd blow his load prematurely. It was all he could do to keep his hands at his sides, clenching and unclenching.<br />
<br />
Brian didn't go back for more lotion, though, leaving the head of John's penis uncoated. Instead, he grasped the shaft with both hands and started licking and nuzzling at the head, hesitant at first and then with more enthusiasm. It was too big for him to fit in his mouth, John realized, but he was getting his lips around as much of the tip as he could, running his tongue over and around the slit, making it slick with saliva and precum. At the same time he was stroking his hands up and down John's cock, up and down, up and down.<br />
<br />
John couldn't keep still any longer. He gripped Brian's hips and butt, squeezing them in time to the strokes, hearing Brian gasp. He was flexing his feet too, he found, unable to help pushing his heels up off the ground and lifting his cock into Brian's downstroke, into Brian's mouth. They rocked back and forth together. He held on tighter. Something bumped into his scrotum and nudged it backwards -- Brian's penis getting hard again, he realized. He tried to reach one hand around to grip it, but he seemed to have lost all co-ordination and couldn't find it. He settled for running his hands around Brian's hips and waist, caressing him clumsily.<br />
<br />
He could feel his nuts throbbing and knew he couldn't hold back much longer. He was rocking faster and faster. He lowered his head against Brian's, cheeks and hair sliding past each other as they moved, and whispered: &quot;I love you.&quot; Then he let go, the orgasm bursting out of him along with a huge, house-shaking roar.<br />
<br />
Brian was still suckling on his dick and must have anticipated the first pulse, managing to swallow most of it. He couldn't possibly keep up, though, and was soon coughing and spluttering as John continued to cum. Two more blasts hit him on the nose and chin before John took pity and tilted Brian's head to one side, out of the way, then took him into a deep kiss. They pressed tightly together, sandwiching John's cock between them as he continued to spray cum into the air. After a time, the flow slowed and then stopped. They carried on kissing.<br />
<br />
Eventually Brian started to shiver and they eased apart stickily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you all right, hun?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, fine. Great. Wonderful. That was, uh, wow. I'm just a bit cold and, um, wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
John wrapped a hand around Brian's penis, engulfing it. &quot;You want I should warm you up a bit, get some circulation going?&quot;</p>
