<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Merritt started thinking about the situations that might confront him.  He thought of the guys at the NSA whom he strongly suspected were corrupt.  They were not an especially masculine lot.  There was Carruthers.  There was a doctor Forman or something like that who&#39;d always looked at him funny in the hallways.  There was an inspector . . something eastern European sounding Dolgish or Dalglesh.  They all made you wonder if they were . . <br />
<br />
And then he remembered it.  At the water cooler, a guy had told a story about an NSA employee, a guy working under cover, a straight guy, who had . . . played for the other team to gain the confidence of some bad guys that he&#39;d gone on to put away for life.  <br />
<br />
Yikes.  Merritt took a deep breath.  H wondered if he&#39;d even do . . . that to take down some scum and protect his country.  With a second sigh, he realized that the Chronivac would actually make it much easier for him.  <br />
<br />
He also realized that he should try something like this before being forced to try it as part of a mission.  He sat down before the Chronivac early one evening and started programming in some changes to himself.  First, he left his superlative track star body the same but changed his air and face.  He made his chestnut brown hair dark brown and he changed his face to be that of a model he picked off the web page of one of the smaller French model agencies.  Then, he revised his orientation  on the Chronivac&#39;s G=0, S=100 scale, his natural orientation was a 95, strongly hetero.  He switched it to a 2, even more strongly gay.  And he turned up his libido from his natural 85 on the Chronivac scale of 0 being indifferent to the opportunity for sex to 100 being lust never stops to a 92.  <br />
<br />
He finished the selections, pressed START and after the usual &quot;Are you sure?&quot; prompt, pressed START again.  The change was set to take place in just 5 seconds.  He felt his face and hair change but that was it.  He went to look at himself in the mirror.  Okay, super hot guy but . . he didn&#39;t notice anything else.  He wasn&#39;t sure what he should be feeling but he thought being super gay would feel different in some way.  He wanted it to.  Maybe that would show masculine he was.  <br />
<br />
But he didn&#39;t feel different at all.  He finally cleaned up around the apartment like he&#39;d been meaning to for weeks including the first vacuuming those carpets had gotten since he&#39;d moved in.  He did some reps with the free weights he had lying around and looked at the clock.  Only 8.  He was pretty sure that the exclusive gay club he&#39;d heard whispered about didn&#39;t kick into high gear till after 9 anyway.  So, Merritt did the dishes and a quick load of laundry still wondering when the really gay feelings would kick in.  <br />
<br />
Then he thought of an appropriate test.  He used to go to the Ford Models web site to daydream about the super hot female models on it.  He&#39;d pleasured himself to images of a few of them a few times each.  He&#39;d barely even noticed that they had a guy model section.  <br />
<br />
He clicked through to it and looked at the girl who&#39;d been his latest favorite.  Nothing.  He could see that she was pretty but he felt nothing more for her.  No imagined sex.  No reflexive thoughts of the feel of her skin under his hands.  Nothing.<br />
<br />
Hmmph.  I really am gay.<br />
<br />
And if that hadn&#39;t clinched it, his reaction to the Ford Models men did.  One hot guy after another, Merritt found himself imagining his lips on that boy&#39;s lips, grabbing each boy from behind, stripping off his pants, feeling velvet soft buns under his palms and driving his hardening penis up each boy in a furious act of lust, love and dominance.<br />
<br />
He sat there at the laptop transfixed looking at one beautiful young guy after another till finally he noticed the clock out of the corner of his eye.  9:30.<br />
&quot;Damn.  I&#39;m so gay I lost track of the time looking at hot guys!&quot;<br />
He changed into his most stylish shirt and jumped into his car.  It was a nice moonlit night as he drove to within a couple blocks of the place.  It was only whispered about online.  And supposedly you had to have someone recommend you to be allowed in.  Merritt watched a couple gay men walk down steps from sidewalk level to a black basement door.  They knocked and flashed some kind of card or badge at the door&#39;s peephole.  Merritt just jogged down and knocked and smirked at the peephole.  The door opened and a huge shaved head guy looked him up and down.  As Merritt had guessed, being a super hot guy was good enough for entrance to a place like this.<br />
<br />
Inside, the place was only half lit and larger than Merritt would have expected.  There was a juke box in a corner that just kept cranking out disco era and more recent dance hits.  The place was pretty full and while everyone seemed to check him out and lick their lips at the sight of him, a group of 4 or 5 coelesced around him, constantly circling him.  There was an older, presumably rich  guy, three middle aged guys and one guy his age but not so good looking.  It seemed to Merritt that he was being steered to be tonight&#39;s entertainment for the older, rich guy.  <br />
<br />
Merritt glanced around the club and a short ways away say a beautiful blond guy with a similar set of satellites orbiting around him.  Merritt looked at the blond guy and smiled.  The blond guy smirked back.  Oh yeah.<br />
<br />
In just those looks they had agreed to leave with each other not these toad courtiers.  Five minutes later they were jogging up the outside stairs ignoring the protestations of their respective old rich guys behind them.  They kissed and got in the blond guy&#39;s Audi sports car.  A few minutes of vastly faster than posted speed limits driving later they were at a high end condo complex.  Merritt followed the guy in, shoving a hand down his pants before the door was even closed.  He tore the blond&#39;s clothes off even as the blond guy tore his own off.<br />
They furiously kissed and wrestled.  Merritt wanted to mount the blond guy who equally wanted to mount him.  The guy was just as tall as him, probably the same 6 foot one and 165 pounds but not quite as well toned or as naturally athletic.  Merritt quickly saw that his naked lover had good pecs and abs but unimpressive buns and an average, at best, dong.<br />
Merritt worked him over the side of the nearby couch and, at first with difficulty, but more and more easily thrust his epic penis up the blond boy.  He&#39;d yelped &quot;You&#39;re . . too . . big!&quot; but had proven an able recipient.  Merritt and the blond boy, who turned out to be named Ryan, did everything two gay guys can do.  Merritt was quite glad that Ryan turned out to be much smaller than him between the legs.  <br />
<br />
When it came for Merritt to be mounted by Ryan, there he was underneath another guy getting his insides stretched and tickled by another guy&#39;s dong and quite enjoying it when he thought, what will straight me think of this in 12 hours.  But nothing slowed his lust.  He was a beautiful guy and so was Ryan.  He told Ryan that he was &quot;new to the scene&quot; and that he wanted to try everything.  Ryan had smirked at this.  He was particularly taken with Merritt&#39;s extra round buns, repeatedly slapping them when he got the chance.  &quot;You should be in ballet!&quot; he told Merritt.<br />
<br />
Merritt sheepishly admitted that, in fact, he had been a ballet dancer.  Ryan exulted, &quot;I knew it!&quot;  He made Merritt show him some ballet dancer flexibility.  Merritt did several pirouette turns on the floor of Ryan&#39;s bedroom and then, as they kissed, Merritt worked one ankle over Ryan&#39;s shoulder.  Then he got the other over Ryan&#39;s other shoulder while never stopping kissing him.  He didn&#39;t tire of kissing the god-like countenance of this boy.  He had perfect peaches and cream skin, all over him that any woman would envy.  <br />
<br />
Merritt finally woke early the next morning, his limbs entwined with beautiful Ryan&#39;s spooning in front of him.  He gently got up, so as not to wake him and found his clothes by the door.  He left a note thanking him but saying he was going back to his home.  He was a half mile away when he felt his face changing and saw, in a storefront window, that he was himself again.</p>
