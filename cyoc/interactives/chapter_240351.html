<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Processing* the device read. With excitement Jack&#39;s eyes quickly shot up to find one of the boys he scanned earlier. He quickly found Ryan and noticed the man was now sporting a goatee. Small black horn nubs popped up out of his hair and began to quickly grow.  More than that his clothing was starting to move and shift. His green shirt seemed to shift into a loose ancient Greek style chiton, his shorts and shoes completely disappearing. While Jack would have kept watching Ryan transform, his focus was broken by a sudden felling of dizziness and pressure in his head. Reaching up he felt something small and hard.<br />
<br />
Now in a growing panic, Jack quickly reached out for his phone. He quickly minimized the reality app and pulled up his camera flipping it to see himself. Looking back was Jack with elf-like ears, a newly sprouted goatee and two small black nubs growing out of his messy blonde hair, increasing in size. <br />
&quot;No way!&quot; he almost yelled this aloud but remembering his awareness settings managed to stifle himself as to not draw attention. Why was he transforming? Jack didn&#39;t wish to be a satyr. <br />
Like Ryan, Jack&#39;s clothes began to shift his pants and shoes disappearing and simple black shirt turning into a loose chiton. Hair was now beginning to grow across Jack&#39;s body making him itch, his legs especially. Jack pulled the app back up, trying to get an answer. Though Jack was having a hard time using the app. While his ongoing transformation wasn&#39;t painful, it was incredibly disorienting. He managed to pull up the query screen and type:<br />
*How many people are transforming into satyrs in this lecture hall?*<br />
It answered back: *Seven*<br />
&quot;Seven?!&quot; Jack thought to himself in exasperation, &quot;it rounded 6.5 up!&quot; <br />
The itching eased as Jack&#39;s fur finished growing in. His legs were now completely covered with a light brown fur a bit darker than his blonde head hair. Healthy patches also grew across his arms, shoulders, chest, and stomach. <br />
Next came a wave of...elation? Jack could suddenly smell everything more intensely. The snacks students had brought with them, shampoos and detergents they washed their clothes with, who had exercised before class. Among them were some particularly strong earthy scents Jack also seemed to be emanating. &quot;Those must be the other satyrs,&quot;  he thought to himself taking them in. Next came an improvement to  his hearing as the elf like ears continued to shift, taking on a caprine shape and a covering of blonde fur. Surprisingly all the new sounds weren&#39;t overwhelming. While Jack couldn&#39;t identify everything he was now hearing he could pick out everything important like the grad student&#39;s lecture in the background. Jack closed his eyes and simply relaxed taking in all the scents and noise and new sensations. Like the sudden flickering behind Jack let him know he now had a little tail wagging in pleasure. Jack felt his horn nubs grow and curl back.   <br />
Jack could feel himself getting hard as his feet and legs continue shifting. He was curious what his groin looked like under his chiton. Was it goat or human or something in between? Jack had the sudden urge to simply rip of his chiton and get acquainted with his newly transformed body but managed to suppress the desire and keep his cool in the lecture hall.  While he hadn&#39;t initially wished to be a satyr he had to admit that this was so far feeling pretty amazing.<br />
Jack&#39;s dizziness and disorientation faded as the app let out a soft ding signifying completion. There were now seven satyrs in the lecture hall. Jack opened his eyes now able to focus and identify all of them. <br />
His eyes went first to Ryan in his green chiton. The brown haired satyr was taking notes as the grad student continued on. This led Jack&#39;s eyes to the grad student who funnily enough seemed to be one of the initial satyr wishers. Instead of a chiton he sported a high quality toga that hung nicely around him. He had a good sized set of ram horns and a somewhat caprine quality to his nose. Next Jack looked for Ethan. Ethan&#39;s button shirt transformed into a loose vest, his jeans into a loose pair of jean shorts. Brad the athlete was nearby he wore only a simple loin cloth. Like the grad student, Brad now had a caprinesque nose. While all the satyrs Jack had seen so far had patches of fur spread across their upper bodies, Brad was basically fur covered from his beard down. <br />
The remaining two satyrs Jack wasn&#39;t able to scan and get the names of. He pulled up the app and quickly looked around to find them. He saw one of the new satyrs sitting near the front row listening intently to the lecturer. This one was a red haired and red furred satyr. Like the grad student he wore a toga but his was a shade of soft blue color. He was holding the hand of the girl seated next to him. A girlfriend if Jack had to guess. He ran the app over the red haired satyr, *Henry likes his girlfriend, but is currently fantasizing about the lecturer.* <br />
&quot;So Henry is his name.&quot; Jack thought as he made a mental note to himself. It took a moment to find the final satyr. Like Jack he had also found his way into a corner of the lecture hall where he took notes. This last satyr&#39;s transformation was the most drastic. His face had become incredibly goat like pushing out into a partial muzzle. Jack could even see him...chewing cud... The dark animalistic facial hair that framed his face had patches of white mixed in. Though he was smaller in size than Brad, he was similarly fur covered across his upper body. A dark fur with similar streaks of white like his facial hair. As such he was also dressed in just a simple loin cloth. Running the app over this almost anthro goat gave back the sentence: *Gabe stole crate of wine from the college&#39;s food service.*  <br />
&quot;So Ryan, Ethan, Brad, Henry, Gabe, the lecturer, and I are the 1/10,&quot; Jack thought to himself. &quot;Oh that&#39;s right I should get the lecturer. <br />
Finally Jack ran the app over the lecturer. It read back: *Andy is trying his best to focus on his lecture, but is finding Jack&#39;s scent distracting.*<br />
&quot;He finds me distracting?&quot; Jack thought. Taking in a quick smell of the other satyrs Jack did notice a difference to his scent. There was something...thicker about it. Jack quickly realized it was probably because of his erect cock. It seems the lack of awareness also gave Jack a lack of control unlike the other satyrs. Realizing this, Jack quickly excused himself from class. Suddenly transforming into a satyr seemed like a pretty good excuse to cut class. He could at least head home to try and relieve himself enough to get through class and then figure out a way to use the app and figure everything out. <br />
Thankfully Jack seemed to naturally adjust to using his new legs and hooves. He was able to nimbly and quietly clop his way out of class and into the outside hall. <br />
Heading down the hall Jack realized...</p>
