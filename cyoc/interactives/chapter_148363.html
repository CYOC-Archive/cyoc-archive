<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>When you’ve been hoping someone continues with an italian/irish or any tf in general...<br/>
<br/>
So HAH! Take something completely different! A strict asian dad!<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to FMAlkemist for some help ;) </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“UNH!”<br />
<br />
Skyler O’Donnell yipped as his other hand SMACKED his palm from continually jerking off his hard-on, ending him from his pleasure induced trance, replacing his thoughts with a different...yet very familiar, booming bass.<br />
<br />
“Do your work this instant!”<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, his mobile phone expanded, developing a keypad and a larger monitor into a laptop, whose well-maintained and polished regularly, as it turned on itself to a window screen of mountains and bamboo trees, asking for a password.<br />
<br />
Skyler blinked, his hard on was still raging as despite the interruption, he felt hornier than ever! Yet he knew better than to disobey the voice that spoke in his head, as he entered the password. Fingers typing away as though it was a routine habit of his.<br />
<br />
Almost like in a robotic fashion, he opened on the documents and began typing away like it was the end of the world, expertly using the mousepad, dragging and typing symbols like it was nothing.<br />
<br />
Minutes worth of work done in seconds, his hands became rough and dark, multitudes of wrinkles appeared and reached down to his wrists as though the workload was really getting to him, was consuming him...and he allowed himself to be consumed.<br />
<br />
He had a lot of work to be done after all.<br />
<br />
FLICK!<br />
<br />
Light turned itself on, his dark olive, weathered hands was revealed to him-who is still feverently typing on the computer, he tried to glance down, resist and...maybe feel those old man hands of his...that is until his mind became bombarded with the next set of tasks once again.<br />
<br />
With knowledge comes experience, as the neglect to his carnal sexual arousal pumped straight-laced testosterone to his biceps, toughening up exactly the way Skyler likes it, thick like a hill, but no flexing...furthering the pent up arousal, pumping of manliness throughout his body.<br />
<br />
Veins could be seen running down his forearms, as the dark olive tan surged to his shoulders, which broadened and doubled  in size as though he finally deserved to be called an adult. Huge...just like a certain man, but with every gay thought or lust, a loud reaffirmation ensued.<br />
<br />
“Focus on your work!”<br />
<br />
He was feeling hot, internally and externally as he was rushed to meet ridiculous quotas every second. His arousal became more of a menace than help as the stress of it all rushed it longer and swelled in girth.<br />
<br />
His back firmly pressed against the wall of the bed, cracking his neck to make way for the slabs of muscle trailing in both directions as his spine straightened, his strong shoulders complimenting his developed back, as his throat gulped down a sweet of herbal candy, clearing his throat and vocal chords.<br />
<br />
“Focus on your work!” He spoke.<br />
<br />
Hearing the voice coming out from his own mouth, he felt a sense of pride as he sped up even quicker, and yes it is possible! Pectorals bobbing out firmly with extremely stressed nipples, a tight muscle gut tightened below with the faint traces of a six pack. <br />
<br />
But he was not allowed to touch it...he has to-<br />
<br />
“Focus on your work!”<br />
<br />
With that being shot, a wave of nausea and anger struck against his temples, all the while his hairline receded like those chinese businessmen back In Taiwan, trimming aside all the length with only a short neatly combed asian corporate cut that dares not go below his neck. Leaving some greys in his black hair, but that was not the only place with it.<br />
<br />
His hard on was surrounded by a dusting of greyness, his chest and legs were also not spared as they too were coated with a thin layer of age, both in hair and hue. As his legs SHOT! All the way to the end of the king sized bed, muscled calves pushing his height to a 6ft 4 as they were complimented with a wiggle of those size 13s.<br />
<br />
Now here comes the shift from arousal to hate. As the man reaffirmed himself at the task ahead, his boner was filled with anger and the stress of being a chinese man, discipline, and ensuring traditions stay the same, especially heterosexuality.<br />
<br />
“Disgraceful Youths these days!” He proclaimed.<br />
<br />
Like a door SLAMMING SHUT! His buttocks clenched into steel as they were hard as a rock, and in his beliefs which the gay skyler had no choice but to agree. It was wrong! After all-<br />
<br />
“Who needs these gay urges when you have a wife!”<br />
<br />
And if he has a wife-he should not be lying in bed while doing his work. That would be so untidy! What would she think?<br />
<br />
The effects followed instantly as his bed pushed him out of the door, and onto the wall of the living room suite. Yes, he did ask for a room here, why should he be surprised?<br />
<br />
He was a CEO after all.<br />
<br />
His bed separated into two margins, with the first one attaching itself to the wall as the monitor was placed on it. The second gave a mahogany vibe as his feet touched the ground, his back and butt were glued to the hotel chair as he pushed himself nearer to the table, a bright lamp turning itself on as his vision is far from perfect.<br />
<br />
Despite all this, the man was not satisfied! He had to work more! He was still angry with those millennials! And most importantly-He was naked!<br />
<br />
The bed sheets that followed along wrapped themselves in modesty around the elder, causing his frustration to grow stronger as his gay side fears that he will never able to see himself unclothed again-before the hetero elderly male yelled that he should not be naked in the first place! <br />
<br />
And that should be so, as his feet and legs were wrapped with rich lining, they constrict around his beefy thighs like they were made for a king, and rightly so as it was HIS Wong Dynasty. As a polished pair of brown dress shoes with a pointed end was glued stuck to the ground as they remained GROUNDED in his beliefs.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, his hard on was continuously tugged on by an invisible force. Causing the sheets to center around his mast and form silky briefs made from the silk worms of China, also made in China were the dark blue-freshly ironed dress pants that supported his hardened, patriarchal attitude.<br />
<br />
Although despite his more conservative appearance, the pleasure and pent up frustration from below only grew further with every TUG!<br />
<br />
-DING!-<br />
“Hey dad...”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the face cam of his computer switched on, as an...oddly familiar face appears on the opposite end of the screen. Although, it was a bit blurry, but for some reason-he really wants to yell at that guy.<br />
<br />
The lining wrapped around his toned bod, ensuring he is not seen as unruly with a row of buttons appearing the center. Glued to his bod all the way down to the cuffs as they were sealed with an intricately shaped cufflink, golden...and he was certain it was shaped in the shape of the chinese letter ‘WONG’.<br />
<br />
Next comes the second layer, as the collar folded itself down as a light purple checkered tie prided itself on his chest. Meanwhile, a dark navy blue suit jacket wrapped itself neatly over his dress shirt, completing the ensemble of the CEO.<br />
<br />
The CEO of Wong Trading Co.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are your grades dropping? Is it this girlfriend of yours? You are failing to uphold the Wong name!&#39;<br />
<br />
His voice was stern, almost harsh even as he talked to the individual...who he could not see clearly. His eyes narrowed in eyesight, as his epicanthic folds became fuller. His perspective and pride on his culture and his traditions back in Taiwan became more important to him. And with every sharpening and chiselling on his oblong shaped jaw, his impression of the west...<br />
<br />
It was regressive, as far as honour and grades were concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, it&#39;s not like that...&quot;<br />
&quot;Nonsense! Your grades must improve!&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, Darren was a grade A student...however, even an A was acceptable as the Wong family prided on distinctions, and being at the top of their class!<br />
<br />
But despite all of this, he became harsher with every syllable, as wrinkles dawned the middle age man. Past his 50s and into the 60s, as crows feet and eye bags sunk into the old man’s complexion. Yet despite all of this, and his obsession of his historical culture, he was considered to be very dashing...and handsome to many.<br />
<br />
And it was no surprise why his son turned out to be as good looking as he was...But however, if his SON were to get any lower...it would result in a harsh punishment...<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad...&quot;<br />
&quot;And why are YOU awake? Sleep is needed to stay awake in class...&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes flared as his member was TUGGED! At the YOU syllable, as with every letter-his chinese accent became thicker. Like a flick in the switch as every ounce of pleasure was concealed and reserved for his wife. Meanwhile, his former attraction to men and rage is reserved for every single unruly youth that dares goes against his principles.<br />
<br />
And that includes his son!<br />
<br />
&quot;Da...Father...&quot;<br />
&quot;NOW you show me respect?&quot;<br />
<br />
His face contorted with every TUG! Making really stereotypically (and might I add- very hot) faces like an asian dad in heat. Like some kind of sitcom as his face squeezed like in one moment, and the next moment BURSTING OUT as his son tried to appease the father.<br />
<br />
Maybe its cause Skyler O’Donnell may have found Darren Wong hot...that Mr Wong Ti&#257;n k&#333;ng was so harsh on him because he was so DISGUSTED at the gay attraction. But hey, who knows? Maybe Skyler is getting an internal kick out of it as he fades into those masculine pecs of the angry asian father.<br />
<br />
And with every tug, he was going to become every essence of it-<br />
<br />
A strict asian dad.<br />
<br />
TUG! <br />
TUG!<br />
TUG!<br />
“U NO B-SIAN, U ASIANNNNNNNNN!”<br />
<br />
He gave a really loud accented howl, unleashing every ounce of energy and disciplinary action on the rebellious teenager. Loads and loads of decade long parenting crawled out of his underwear, trailing up his chest like streams back in the countryside.<br />
<br />
Like strokes of calligraphy, a pair of frameless rectangular prescription specs rested on his stern visage.Ti&#257;n k&#333;ng’s perspective cleared up, as though he had just gotten up from a good night’s sleep and ready to start the day once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Father, I will improve. I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
His son begged, as though the father was, once again, the boss of his life. He gave a proud smirk at his son, glad to see respect being re-instilled on the millennial. <br />
<br />
A re-orient-ation was necessary, and he was proud it had happened sooner than later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Your mother and I coming in next week. She wants to meet this &#39;Cherry&#39; girl...&quot;<br />
<br />
His methods may have always been quite extreme but it always produced results. He loved his son after all, as much as he prides on the Wong legacy...specially knowing some of his nephews and nieces are straying from the path.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night, Father&quot;<br />
&quot;Good night, Son.”</p>
