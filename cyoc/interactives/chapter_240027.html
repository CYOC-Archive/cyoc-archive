<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom furrowed his brow, staring out at the vast forest before him. Finding the nest of this Wendigo wouldn&#39;t be easy, especially with the group he was traveling with.<br />
<br />
The quartet waited &#39;til sunrise, following the trail of the Wendigo to the edge of national forest along the Connecticut/Massachusetts line. The entire trip though, Lynne and Yuriko traded barbs, Garrett attempting to play peacemaker as Tom felt a tension headache building. &quot;Ugh this is like unpaid babysitting,&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Tom felt frustrated. Technically he wasn&#39;t even a part of S.P.E.A.R. When Hailey approached him about the Moreland case, he offered his assistance, finally breaking the case. It was a huge victory for the young cop, but Tom believed it was a one time thing. Then his cousin and his ex-girlfriend burst into S.P.E.A.R office talking about a Wendigo, a murder, and an orphaned child. Now, he found himself once more tasked by S.P.E.A.R into solving another case.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be easier trying to find this thing at night?&quot; Garrett asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but that&#39;s also the problem,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;Wendigo are active at night. At least that&#39;s what I picked up from Aaron. They&#39;re nocturnal predators so they sleep during the day. If we can find the nest while it&#39;s still sleeping, it&#39;ll be easier to take out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And considering it almost killed you and Lynne, it&#39;s probably better to find it when it&#39;s out cold.&quot; Yuriko added, a smug smirk on her face. Tom could only sigh, watching Lynne turn slightly. He already knew what was coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you could have done any better,&quot; Lynne scoffed. &quot;In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure if you were in my shoes, the kid wouldn&#39;t have survived either.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Yuriko looked to argue once more, Tom raised his friend, looking to end the argument before it began. &quot;Okay enough,&quot; he said firmly. &quot;Arguing amongst ourselves isn&#39;t going to find this thing.&quot; Lynne and Yuriko quieted, staring daggers at eachother as Tom sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ve got a lot of ground to cover and not a lot of daylight. I think we should split up. Stay in contact. Quicker we find this thing, Quicker we can go home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh what kinda scooby doo bullshit is this?&quot; Lynne groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see you coming up with any ideas,&quot; Yuriko argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because any idea would be better than splitting up and wandering around the woods!&quot; Lynne exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynne, Yuriko, enough!&quot; Tom yelled. Tom now glared at Lynne, his heart quickening as he gazed at the woman he still geld a flame for. &quot;Lynne you know I&#39;m right,&quot; he said softly. &quot;The thing is out cold right now and won&#39;t wake up until the sun sets. We&#39;re not trying to kill it, just find it. Once we do that, regroup and we can figure out how to take it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne opened her mouth to argue before stopping. &quot;Okay maybe,&quot; she huffed. &quot;I still think splitting up is dumb though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not going to be out here all day,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;We search a few hours and then bail. If we have to come back tomorrow so be it. We do it safe, we take our time, and we don&#39;t play the hero. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay fine,&quot; Lynne huffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Tom said, relief washing over him. &quot;Lynne, take Yuriko and start on the East. I&#39;ll check the West.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now that&#39;s bullshit,&quot; Lynne and Yuriko argued, the pair glaring at one another. &quot;Why are we working together?&quot; Yuriko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuriko and I have a psychic bond,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;If she finds something she can tell me instantly and I can do the same. Neither you or Garrett can do that and in case you didn&#39;t notice, cell service is sketchy at best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Yuriko and Lynne huffed.<br />
<br />
Saying their goodbyes, Garrett now kissed Lynne as Tom wished his little sister luck. As the two men now walked, an awkward silence washed over both Garrett and Tom. A silence Garrett felt he needed to break.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I can handle myself pretty well Tom,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Tom stated, checking a map as the pair continued. &quot;I mostly put those two together for two reasons. One, I couldn&#39;t deal with their constant bickering and needed a break and Two, I&#39;m hoping they can patch things up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you set them up.&quot; Garrett smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tom grinned. &quot;They used to get along. Hoping they can workout their issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean us.&quot; Garrett replied.<br />
<br />
For a moment, both Tom and Garrett were quiet. Garrett wasn&#39;t exactly wrong. It had come as a shock when Lynne and Garrett began dating. Tom feeling hurt his own cousin would date his old girlfriend. The one girl Tom loved wholeheartedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta ask Garrett, why? Of all the girls in the world, why did you have to pick her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically she asked me out.&quot; Garrett replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s besides point,&quot; Tom grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Garrett sighed, running his hand through his thick hair. &quot;I didn&#39;t want it to happen, it just...happened. Back in high school, I never thought a girl like Lynne would even look at me! I mean seriously, I was what? A Freshman when you were a Senior. You were the king of high school, I was just some skinny kid. I looked up to you, I guess envied you. You were the coolest guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about now...cousin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still respect you,&quot; Garrett said quickly. &quot;And you&#39;re family. I&#39;m always going to love you.....No homo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom chuckled at the last part, finding Garrett&#39;s humor endearing. He recalled when Garrett came out as bisexual, his younger cousin barely 16 at the time. He admired his grace and humor, even if the young man was terrified how others would react. Needless to say, his parents, siblings, and extended family were all accepting of Garrett&#39;s sexuality. &quot;Point taken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still care about Lynne don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom shrugged, it sounded insane. Lynne had dumped him. Somehow though, he still carried a torch for the young woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it stupid that I&#39;m still in love with her?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Garrett said softly. &quot;No, it isn&#39;t. I mean I get it. Lynne lights up a room everytime she enters. What&#39;s not to love? But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a pain in the ass,&quot; Tom chuckled, Garrett blushing before offering his cousin a small smirk. &quot;Definitely,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know...I mean...I&#39;m not sure how much more I can take? Lynne.... well, she&#39;s....intense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom paused, casting his cousin a knowing look. Despite the couples passion for eachother, Tom could sense it was a relationship not meant to last. &quot;Do me a favor,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;When it happens, don&#39;t break her heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-W-What?!&quot; Garrett stammered. &quot;W..what do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll understand when you&#39;re ready,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;Right now, let&#39;s just find this Wendigo...and hope Lynne and Yuriko don&#39;t kill each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the same time Garrett and Tom were talking with each other, Lynne and Yuriko were also in their own awkward silence as the two women glared at one another. Yuriko was finally the one to break the silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....what&#39;s his name?&quot; Yuriko asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Lynne asked confused who she was talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;The kid, the baby? Did you and Garrett come up with a name for him when you took him to S.P.E.A.R.? Your first time being a parent and picking out your kid&#39;s name, that&#39;s sweet.&quot; Yuriko commented with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay first of all, his name&#39;s &#39;Tim&#39; and secondly, Garret and I didn&#39;t name him. His mother did, it was one of the last things she said before....&quot; Lynne said before stopping in her tracks thinking about Yuriko&#39;s words. &quot;She....she had asked us to take care of Tim. Garrett and me. Yuriko, I...I want to honor that woman&#39;s words but....and please before I tell you this, don&#39;t mention this to Garrett or Tom, please?&quot; Lynne asked as Yuriko tried to see the boys but didn&#39;t and just nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....I&#39;m a little scared. It&#39;s all been fun and games with Garrett and I, it&#39;s been so exciting to do all this stuff with him. Maybe that&#39;s why I asked Garrett out, because I needed some excitement in my life. But when Garrett and I were holding Tim on that old church ground, our whole world began to slow down. I know you think I&#39;m the one who&#39;s always wants to goof around and play, but I&#39;m the youngest of three sisters, who all have grown up and have kids now and suddenly now the world is telling me to grow up as I&#39;m holding this kid. Yesterday....yesterday, I was just a kid and today....I&#39;m an adult.&quot; Lynne said as Yuriko just stood there with her mouth open not knowing how to respond to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now come on, we&#39;ve got a Wendigo asshole to find.&quot; Lynne said as Yuriko just nodded.</p>
