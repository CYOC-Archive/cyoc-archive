<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caitlin Singleton groaned as she slowly began to regain consciousness. The last thing she remembered was sitting in her office. As her eyes slowly began to focus, she gasped in surprise. Scrambling to her feet, the 56 year old black woman now anxiously took in the white room she was laying in.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on,&quot; she whispered as she unsteadily got to her feet. &quot;Where am I?&quot; Smoothing out her business suit, the plus sized woman now slowly toured her prison. There were no doors that she could see and no windows. All Caitlin could make out was a mirror that extended the length of the wall. Approaching it she now tried to peer through it. Obviously it was a two way mirror and Caitlin was curious as to who was on the other side. &quot;I don&#39;t know who you are but you&#39;ve messed with the wrong person,&quot; she bellowed. &quot;When I&#39;m done with you your grandchildren will be in debt!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sound of a panel opening now drew Caitlins attention upwards. A panel in the ceiling had shifted, revealing a white light that blanketed the room in its glow. Unsure what this was, she found herself staring at it for a moment before the sound of something metallic hitting the floor drew her attention. Looking towards the floor, Caitlin was puzzled as she noticed her earrings. Somehow the hoops had come loose, the woman bending down to pick then up. For a moment she stared at them before stepping close to the mirror to put then back in.<br />
<br />
A look of confusion now plastered itself along Caitlins face. Somehow her earlobes had sealed themselves but how was that possible? Studying herself closely she could see see her earlobes were flawless, it was almost as if they had never been pierced. As she continued to try to solve that puzzle an odd feeling began to work its way over her body. It felt like a static shock yet more pleasant. Before she could even wonder why, she gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening,&quot; she whispered, gazing at her reflection. Caitlins face was changing, the crows feet around her eyes smoothing,  her skin tone evening, the few stray greys in her hair vanishing. Giggling Caitlin now held her hands in front of her face, noting they were becoming smoother. As she ran her hands along her body she noticed it firming under her business suit, her breasts rising, her curves sharpening. Gazing in wide eyed joyous wonder Caitlin now beheld a 40 year old version of herself. &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m getting younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus furrowed his brow as he watched his former employer gaze in wonder at her youthful body. Right now the woman was ecstatic about the return of her youth but, he knew that wouldn&#39;t last for long. After meeting with the Boss, he had returned to Caitlins law office, finding the lawyer working late as she often did during the week. Although he had orders to capture both Melissa and Caitlin, he hesitated when it cane to Melissa. This fact was now thrown in his face as the Boss stood by his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; he said. &quot;This was the lawyer that employed you?&quot; Casseus nodded, the two watching as Caitlin joyfully retreated through her 30s. &quot;I see you&#39;ve found Caitlin but tell me? Where&#39;s Melissa Fuller?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;She wasn&#39;t present,&quot; Casseus replied. &quot;And I feared delaying returning with Caitlin would give the wizards time to respond.&quot; The Boss nodded, watching Caitlin for a moment before responding. &quot;More like you didn&#39;t want to give up your plaything,&quot; the Boss stated, causing Casseus to flinch. &quot;I get it. It&#39;s been so long since you got your dick wet you didn&#39;t want to give it up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus scowled continuing to watch Caitlin as the Boss continued. &quot;Hopefully one member of the Dark Garden works,&quot; he said. &quot;If it doesn&#39;t though, I&#39;m going to make sure you&#39;re held accountable. You don&#39;t want Melissa getting Clean Slated? Fine. But if shit goes sideways I&#39;m going to strap you down and torture her in front of you....slowly. We clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crystal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; the Boss replied happily, noticing the look of concern on Caitlins face as she passed 30 and sped towards 20. &quot;When this is over have Felicitys bunny mascot see her,&quot; he said. &quot;Hopefully it&#39;s willing to take her as part of the Dark Garden. After that, make Caitlin a teenager and enroll her in Magic High. Felicity could use an ally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood sir,&quot; Casseus replied. &quot;And how is everything else proceeding.&quot; The Boss shrugged, listening to the panicked cries of Caitlin for a moment. &quot;As planned,&quot; he stated. &quot;The vampire rescue team is in position and the others are getting ready to strike. Let&#39;s hope, for your sake that Melissa is the only audible tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlin was panicking as she now banged on the two way mirror. The process wasn&#39;t stopping. Gazing at her reflection, Caitlin was shocked to see an 18 year old version of herself staring back. The weight of middle age had been wiped clean, leaving a fresh faced teenage girl with the curves of a 20 something. Caitlin recalled all to well this time of her life. She had been the most popular girl in school. Homecoming queen, Prom Queen, dating the captain of the basketball team, and going to the best parties. At 18 Caitlin possessed D cup breasts that were impossibly firm with curves to match and a washboard stomach. Life had been easy, all she needed to do was bat her eyes and she got everything she wanted. The world was her oyster and no one, not even the faculty could stop her. She recalled passing her classes Senior year by simply flirting with a teacher for straight A&#39;s. She wouldn&#39;t sleep with them though, that would have been gross but she could blackmail them. It was how she received scholarship offers to some of the most prestigious universities in the country.<br />
<br />
Looking at herself, Caitlin watched as the 18 year old girl gradually became a fresh faced girl of 17. The weight around her midsection had long ago vanished, her stomach perfectly flat with curves that were only beginning to diminish. Grasping her slacks tightly, she now examined the walls, desperately searching for an escape. &quot;You can&#39;t do this to me,&quot; she bellowed in an increasingly youthful tone. &quot;Do you know who I am!&quot;<br />
<br />
The lack of response was infuriating for the fresh faced 16 year old. Wobbling in heels that now felt slightly oversized, the teenage girl furiously banged on the glass trying to get her captors attention. Caitlins efforts though were fruitless as she continued to shrink back through high school. Soon enough where a gorgeous 18 year old girl stood was a skinnier Freshman girl, only beginning to show the traces of her future beauty.<br />
<br />
At 14 Caitlin had grown skinnier than what she had been as an adult. The girls curves less pronounced as her bust and height began to diminish. Slowly her hands began to be swallowed by her jacket, the girls clothing billowing out around her as she shrank backwards through puberty. As she exited her teens and became a girl of 12,  Caitlins slacks finally lost hold, sliding down her chubby thighs and pooling around her ankles.<br />
<br />
A girlish squeal of embarrassment now echoed through the room as Caitlin freed herself of her useless slacks. As 12 became 11 the chubby girls eyes began to well with tears as she sadly looked down at her chest. Thr once proud breasts she had been so proud of melted into her chest. Caitlin was now just a chubby looking fifth grade, her blouse and jacket covering her to mid thigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t wanna be this young,&quot; the 10 year old moaned, her voice high and shrill. Tears now began to flow freely down her cheeks. Caitlin now began the embarrassing trip back through grade school, her face rounding, baby fat slowly emerging on her small body. Standing barefoot, the girl wiped her eyes. The floor was cold on her tiny feet, her blouse and jacket descending lower and lower as she crept backwards in age.<br />
<br />
Now only 5 years old, Caitlin wailed like a spoiled child. Kindergarten, she was barely old enough for kindergarten at this point. Reduced to a small chubby girl with wild ebony hair. Memories of that time were fresh in her mind, how her mother would always try and tame it when putting it in braids. She had been a beautiful if not chubby girl who everyone fawned over. Was this her fate? To have to relive life again starting at five?!<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo,&quot; Caitlin whimpered as she gazed at her appearance. She certainly wasn&#39;t 5 years old anymore. Firmly back in preschool, Caitlin watched as her height continued to diminish, her jacket and blouse sinking lower and covering her feet. The girls face continued to round, the neck hole growing ever larger around her tiny head. Eventually her jacket fell away, her shoulders so narrow they could no longer support it. Now even preschool seemed like something to look forward too as she hit her third birthday and raced for two.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dun wanna be a baby,&quot; she cried. &quot;Dun wanna be a baby! Dun wanna..&quot;<br />
<br />
Caitlins tongue betrayed her as she passed two. Too young to talk the the toddler girl wobbled for a moment on unsteady legs before falling onto her rear. Fresh tears now leaked from her eyes, her teeth slowly receding into her gums as she sped towards infancy. Caitlins mind was a jumble of thoughts, thoughts that were seemingly pulled apart as she sat there crying. Years of knowledge were disintegrated in an instant, memories of her former life vanishing like smoke. Only primitive instincts seemed to remain as the last of Caitlin Singletons knowledge vanished. <br />
<br />
The small infant girl simply whimpered, barely old enough to sit up, she found herself sitting in a pile of clothes. She didn&#39;t know where she was, she barely knew who she was. All she knew was that she was alone and scared. As a door opened, revealing a brilliant light the infant girl simply stared with the wide eyes of an infant. Slowly her wide eyed curiosity turned to infantile laughter as a four earred bunny rabbit now hopped towards her.</p>
