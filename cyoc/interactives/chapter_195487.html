<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick tossed and turned in his sleep, unaware that blocks away, two of his classmates decided to change him quite so drastically. His day had been rather eventful, and he&#39;d gone to sleep frustrated - he wasn&#39;t exactly the smartest boy in his class. Heaven forbid. He was absolutely book dumb. But he trusted himself enough to know when he could go ahead with trying to say he was into someone. Nick nursed a massive crush on senior girl Natalie Prescott - a raven-haired, well endowed beauty who captured his imagination. But when he tried to go to her, she had said he was on top of being simply too young, just as well also too &quot;girly&quot;.<br />
<br />
She coached it in telling him she was sure there were other girls. She said that he was blessed in many other ways. She tried to make it less humiliating. It didn&#39;t work. Nick still felt like she was laughing at him. Even when she tried her best. Because Nick didn&#39;t want any other girl at the school.<br />
<br />
He wanted Natalie Prescott. She was beautiful, she seemed so mature, nice, smart and good. He just wished she could see him as a prospective mate. Not knowing as he tossed and turned in bed that a monkey&#39;s paw might well have curled its one wretched finger as he slept. A bead of sweat formed at his forehead as he clutched his sheets.<br />
<br />
His body began to stretch longer, hitting a growth spurt as he slept. A leg kicked and he tossed and turned. He felt his leg dart out of the covers, and he pulled it back in. His arms just as well also began to grow longer and more matured - slight amounts of hair growing in on the forearms and in his armpits. Nowhere near as hairy as some of the boys got, reflecting his continuing nature. Nick grunted and gasped in his sleep as his face started shifting.<br />
<br />
His features changed, maturing, growing - he did not lose his effeminate looks, rather, they seemed to adapt to an older frame and a more capable body. His features remained fine, effete and pretty, complimented increasingly by his nicely angular cheekbones. He bit his thick, kissable lips. Though he knew it not, he was readily encroaching on eighteen years of age, and then crested it. Very slight body hair littered across his bare chest and stomach - a show of his age.<br />
<br />
His hair grew if anything slightly longer and even more silky and refined. This was a young man who very well cared for his hair and face. A sort of metrosexual charm entered the equation of Nick Davis. As he aged due to the influence of the Chronivac, twisting and turning in his sleep as he went, his body would change just as well as the rest of him.<br />
<br />
What started as a gawky and very thin body started to grow more muscular. <br />
<br />
Though not so in the way of the jocks and athletes that ran about on the football field. No, Nick evidently worked out purely for aesthetic appreciation. He was devoted to the appealing look - thin, taut, but very obviously muscled. Bulk wasn&#39;t the goal - aesthetics, symmetry, and smooth function was. He felt his ass grow bigger, developing into a muscular and tight bubble that strained his pants. He bit his lip, his fantasies of Natalie in his sleep growing more lewd.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Natalie...kiss me...fuck me, Natalie...&quot; He murmured, grinding his ass into the bed again. Fuck, he felt good. Even in his dreaming state, he could register that much. His tightly toned arms gripped the sides of the bed and Nick found himself imagining himself and Natalie going under the bleachers at school. They started kissing - Nick eager to lose his virginity even though he knew he was a very popular guy he was sure - and she was cupping his chin, feeling his body.<br />
<br />
Nick wasn&#39;t so sure why he was so ripped, but he embraced it. He loved it. Everything about him was pretty. He was like...a boyband lead singer. Could he be a boyband singer? For some reason the idea gained traction with him. He wasn&#39;t sure if he was gonna achieve fame doing it right now, but for now, he just recorded what he and his friends had---<br />
<br />
So weird! What a weird fantasy this was!<br />
<br />
Natalie was kissing him, though, in this dream - and that was what mattered to Nick. She was telling him he was such a pretty guy. Complimenting his body, his gorgeous face, saying she - she! - was envious of how beautiful he was. She wanted to know his skin care routine, what he did to keep his hair like that. And then she took his cock in her mouth, and Nick wanted to scream - but he didn&#39;t want to alert the other students he was down here getting a blow jo---<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuurgh!!&quot; Nick surged awake. He found himself propped up by his arms, eyes wide with desire, and the newly minted 19 year old was unaware that the changes on him had halted. Nick panted, looking around, and seeing his feet sticking out of the covers at the end...and registering just how odd that was. He never had trouble staying under the covers unless...<br />
<br />
His eyes drifted down, and his mouth outright hung open. He registered wetness inside his heavily strained pajama pants, and saw the tight, toned body that now he could call his own. He didn&#39;t even dare make a sound this late at night. At least, not much beyond a gasp. Curious hands roamed over his body, feeling every inch - groaning when he touched his still sensitive cock. &quot;Mm...&quot; It had never felt THAT good before. And it had never done anything like that before.<br />
<br />
Uneasily, the young man slinked out of bed and changed clothes - from one pair of wet pajama pants and boxers to a different pair of boxers - which remained tight on him, making the grown pretty boy wince, but it covered him up. He caught his reflection in the mirror by his bed. He leaned forward toward it, curious, mind reeling, but this was hardly unwanted. He was divided between a sense of sudden panic and a feeling of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
He giggled and slapped his abs, &quot;Toned...&quot; he whispered, &quot;So toned...&quot; His eyes drifted to his cock. Not as big as some other guys&#39; tools, but it was a good seven inches with the remaining erection he had going on. He was sure it was serviceable, and readily able to dish out some pleasure for him. Just touching it made him bite his lip lightly again. &quot;...And so sensitive...&quot;<br />
<br />
There was no way he could stay in and sleep with his body looking and feeling like this. He was full of energy with this strange transformation. He wanted to go out like the other teens did. Enjoy himself. Enjoy this while he had it, on the off chance this was all a dream. He picked out a pair of jeans - his mom bought these by accident, black jeans much too big for him before. She said they were for him to &quot;grow into&quot;. <br />
<br />
She had no idea how soon he&#39;d do so.<br />
<br />
Even these were a little bit snug as he put them on. Nick grinned, and fit on a tank top. This one was tight too, now, and whereas before it fit on him very loosely, hanging down to his waist, now it readily showed his newly formed body. The young man grinned at his reflection, preening and posing for his ever enduring fan in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to have some fun.&quot; Nick whispered to himself, still cautious, but very eager to enjoy this. He considered what to do from here...</p>
