<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your story began when you gotten the news that your uncle... Uncle Thomas, has left you a crate. A crate that he told you to &#39;never ever&#39; open. But being the curious guy you are, you can&#39;t help but see what&#39;s inside...<br />
<br />
Before he passed away, you remembered him being just a fat man. With arm, and leg muscles despite also sporting a round belly. But he&#39;s still very much huggable- Er... rather, strong for what he looked like.<br />
<br />
 He wore two XL shirts, some of them are blank, and some of them have Japanese Kanji that you couldn&#39;t understand what they mean. And with him being 6 foot, and 300 pounds, he also wore jeans the size of W42 x L32. He was only that big then.<br />
<br />
You had a real good time with him when you were a kid. You and him shared interests in wrestling. Be it Pro-Wrestling, Masked-Wrestling, and Sumo Wrestling. Though that last one you never did understand the appeal, but if it meant being with your Uncle Thomas, then you&#39;re willing to play along!<br />
<br />
You complain to him about the Furry Fandom, he only listens as you told him of your complaints. Although he never gave an input, he still listened. Much like how you did when he talks about Japan. In any case you&#39;ve moved on from that phase, not cause you grew to like them, but you have a job to worry about. Other guys also gave up on hating &#39;The Furry Fandom&#39; bandwagon, for similar reasons like yours, and/or some of them to your chagrin &#39;join&#39; the Fandom.<br />
<br />
He also told you few things he know about Japan, not just sumo wrestling. He talked about the culture, the food, and even the language, which to this day you&#39;ve never learned. He even told you that he used to traveled the world because he was a former Wrestler. But you weren&#39;t sure if you even took him seriously at the time...<br />
<br />
But now you&#39;re a man in your twenties, you&#39;re 6&#39;0, and 170 pounds, even at a glance you look fit, but you don&#39;t exactly have an athletic body. You do however, have a job at being an Art, and History teacher. Well an &#39;assistent teacher&#39; for now, until you get your college degree you&#39;ll be working full time as a teacher. You have told your family about what you are going to be doing, except for your Uncle Thomas... you hardly see him anymore. He did&#39;t even respond to your phone messages.<br />
<br />
In fact he was so secretive that you don&#39;t even know where he last worked at! You had a vague memory that he told you that he went to Japan, but that&#39;s it. Most of your interactions with him were brief phone calls now adays. But then he ghosted you... You even assumed he was on a lot of business trips... Of course at the time, you concluded that he simply retired... but now he is leaving this world, and without a chance to make up for lost time!<br />
<br />
Anyway, When you saw him for the last time, he gain a lot of weight compared to when you were a kid. &#39;What happened all those years?!&#39; You thought. Here he was with his newly sized massive body on his death bed, he starts talking to you. &quot;Liam, please listen to me! You must not ever open that crate. I don&#39;t want anything in there to get out, or stolen. Just... Bury it... Bury it in the ground so no one will find it. Can I trust you to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You told him that he would, and you even promised your uncle that you wouldn&#39;t open it, as you crossed your fingers behind your back... You lied to him, and yourself. There&#39;s no way a secret crate like that, wouldn&#39;t peek your interest!<br />
<br />
You&#39;re not even a Furry, but if you&#39;re a cat, or an anthro one at least. You&#39;d be dead by your own curiosity! But at least you still have eight lives!<br />
<br />
A week after the funeral. You&#39;ve moved the crate which it was big enough to reach your knees, and it looked mostly like a box with the lid closed to the attic. While it was heavy, but not something that you can&#39;t handle! Granted, carrying it up the stairs was a pain but not impossible!<br />
<br />
And you look at the crate in front of you, and said to yourself. &quot;Well Liam! You&#39;re about to break your promise to your uncle, I hope your ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! let see what&#39;s in the box?&quot; You say to yourself. And you began to pry the lid open, of course it wouldn&#39;t be this easy. With a padlock preventing anyone from opening it. It was a key only padlock so, you can&#39;t excatly brake it&#39;s code. And the Padlock brand name is too faded for you to find a substitute key for it. You don&#39;t even know how to pick a lock!<br />
<br />
So you decided to pry the dang thing opening, the old fashion way... with a pry bar!<br />
<br />
You were so excited about it, you kept thinking as you try, and try to get it open. You think &#39;What could it be that Uncle Thomas doesn&#39;t want me to open?&#39; Is it lots of money? priceless jewels? old artifacts? Magical, or cursed?<br />
<br />
Though you&#39;ve grown out of it now, you&#39;ve had wished to meet a magical Genie of the lamp, and make wishes back when you were a kid. But those days are over! Now it&#39;s only wishful thinking (no pun intented).<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh! Why does it have to be this hard?!&quot; You threw up your hands. you&#39;re not getting any where with what you have right now. You went to bring your toolbox from the closet of your attic. Looking for the right tool. Your mind starts wondering again...<br />
<br />
As you are brain storming on how to brake it open, thinking of more possiblities...<br />
<br />
Could it be something unusual? Like a weird item, old clothes or... something ordinary... Like diapers?... Ew... You didn&#39;t even want to think about that last one. Would he make you bury a crate that&#39;s just full of diapers? That is stupid! Even if he told you that there is a special type of clothing that&#39;s magical, You would think that your uncle is crazy! You&#39;d either burn it, or go and wear it to prove that it is not magical at all, just to spite him.<br />
<br />
And so you went back to prying the lid open...<br />
<br />
But as you kept prying the lid more, and more. Those scary thoughts occur... What if it ‘is’ as bad as he is implying? Then what&#39;s in there that&#39;s so bad? Is it some sort of dangerous information that can kill the world? Or just ‘your’ world?... an enemy uniform from an old war? A weapon? A Bomb?!<br />
<br />
This made you lose what&#39;s left of your energy. Maybe this ‘ISN&#39;T’ such a good idea after all.<br />
<br />
You walked away from the unopened crate, but as you are about to pass through the doorway, another thought occurs. &#39;If it&#39;s really all that bad, then maybe it&#39;d be better to look at it, and if it&#39;s information, or a weapon then you&#39;ll just have to carry out your uncles wishes, and get rid of it. If nothing else, you&#39;ll just have to destroy it somehow.&#39;<br />
<br />
You do wish though, that he&#39;d tell you what it was that’s in the box, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be doing any of this. &#39;Even when he was dying he didn&#39;t think this through.&#39;<br />
<br />
And so you went back to opening the crate, and continue on, and on. It still didn&#39;t open, so you kept going. and kept going...<br />
<br />
You try, and try again to open it up, and with the lock becoming looser, and looser, it is almost open.<br />
<br />
Just... a little more...<br />
<br />
‘Clank!’<br />
<br />
GOT IT!!!<br />
<br />
The lid is now wide open, and... It was not what you expected to find at all.<br />
<br />
You have finally got that crate lid to open! And... well... you didn&#39;t know what you were expecting really... you don&#39;t even understand what you&#39;re seeing either... But as you see what you&#39;re looking at... You find a note which you assume it was from your Uncle Thomas, but also...</p>
