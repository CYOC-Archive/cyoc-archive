<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dean said, &quot;Well, you know that I&#39;ve been trying to get fit. I don&#39;t want to be average all my life. But it&#39;s difficult. I have read of a special exercise suit that helps a person get more from their exercise. But then I thought, if I wore you, you could do even more to help me get fit than just an exercise suit. You can even do double duty by helping me exercise while also helping me study. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;That&#39;s not what I had in mind but alright on my terms though.&quot; Jeff started typing in the Chronivac but he did ask questions of Dean such as asking Dean to help him find an example of the suit on the internet. Then he was ready and Dean undressed. Jeff felt nervous.<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I really wasn&#39;t expecting to get this intimate with you but we&#39;re about to have skin to skin contact for a while. Are you okay with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean said, &quot;You know that I&#39;m more comfortable in my masculinity than most. I&#39;d like to be more fit to attract the ladies but I don&#39;t need to prove to myself or anyone else that I&#39;m a man. You&#39;ll just be my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had a shocked expression.<br />
<br />
Dean said, &quot;Poor choice of words. You&#39;ll still be my friend but you won&#39;t be human.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I know that but it&#39;s still scary that I&#39;m about to be not human anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean got completely naked and asked, &quot;Okay, now what.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to set a time limit because I didn&#39;t know how often or how long you would want to wear me so I set a trigger. Only you can trigger the change. If you want to wear me, touch my right ear. I will stay clothing for a minimum of fifteen minutes but won&#39;t change back to human as long as you are wearing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean touched Jeff&#39;s right ear and Jeff&#39;s clothes just slid off of him until Dean was just holding an exercise suit. He put Jeff on. Jeff set it so that he matched Dean nearly part for part. That is Jeff&#39;s penis was the part of the suit that covered Dean&#39;s penis. The only exceptions were that Jeff&#39;s head was lowered to cover Dean&#39;s chest and Jeff&#39;s hands were at Dean&#39;s wrists since the suit didn&#39;t have gloves.<br />
<br />
Dean walked into the bathroom to look at himself in the mirror. To anyone looking at Dean, it looked like Dean was wearing a full body exercise suit with no embarrassing bulges. The suit was mostly blue with silver and green stripes.<br />
<br />
Dean asked, &quot;How are you feeling as my suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Weird. I hope you don&#39;t mind but it feels a little erotic having you inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean asked, &quot;You&#39;re not gay are you? Did you have a secret crush on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Honestly no. I still want to date women. I just figured that if I&#39;m going to be clothes for a while, I might as well enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean said, &quot;Well as long as your clothes, I can enjoy it too. I&#39;m going to go for a run now and it would attract too much attention if my suit spoke to me so would you mind keeping silent when in public?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Understood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean headed out for his run. As far as Dean could tell, this wasn&#39;t any different from what he expected wearing an exercise uniform would be like. Jeff on the other hand felt incredible stimulation as Dean&#39;s cock moved around inside Jeff&#39;s cock. Even though Dean was soft, not aroused, Jeff was still distracted by the sensation.<br />
<br />
Finally Dean stopped and said, &quot;You know that if you&#39;re going to help me even more, you&#39;re going to have to move a bit more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff took the hint and began massaging Dean while he ran. Jeff had to exert his own strength to provide resistance to Dean&#39;s movement so the workout would be more effective. Jeff wondered if this exertion would lead to Jeff also becoming fitter.<br />
<br />
When he was done running, Dean headed back to Jeff&#39;s house. Dean asked, &quot;Do you mind if I borrow your shower?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean stripped and started showering. While Dean exercised, Jeff had wanted to massage Dean&#39;s genitals and now that Dean as showering, Jeff wanted to jump in the shower with him but Jeff hadn&#39;t massaged Dean&#39;s genitals and didn&#39;t jump in the shower because he didn&#39;t think it would be appropriate but Jeff did just sit there naked watching Dean shower. After all, he&#39;d just spent time on Dean so being naked together was no big deal anymore. Jeff did have a raging hard on though.<br />
<br />
Dean noticed and asked, &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to get dressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I thought you might want to wear me again after your shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean said, &quot;I don&#39;t need to exercise anymore besides, aren&#39;t you dirty? I wouldn&#39;t want to put on dirty clothes right after a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I already put it in the Chronivac that when I transform, I transform into a clean, brand new suit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean paused for a moment staring at Jeff. &quot;I don&#39;t want to have sex with you but if you do something about that erection, you can get in here with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t do anything about his erection. He just got in the shower with his friend Dean. Dean looked at him, then down at his erection, then back at him.<br />
<br />
Dean said, &quot;I was serious that I don&#39;t want to have sex with you. Do you want to have sex with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;No. I&#39;m aroused and it feels wonderful to just be aroused but I don&#39;t want to have sex with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean and Jeff just looked at each other for a moment. Then Dean put his hands on Jeff&#39;s chest and started soaping. Jeff put his hands on Dean&#39;s shoulders. They then moved in for a kiss. Jeff couldn&#39;t believe that he was actually making out with his best friend. They both had been honest when they said they didn&#39;t want to have sex with each other but it just felt so right to make out. Jeff wondered if he should touch Dean&#39;s cock but before he could, Dean touched his right ear and he was an exercise suit again.<br />
<br />
Dean continued to shower while hugging his exercise suit. Dean stuttered, &quot;I...I...lov...my new exercise suit. What a great birthday present. Thank you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt like he had been abruptly interrupted but went with it. They finished the shower talking about normal guy stuff.<br />
<br />
Because Jeff had set the Chronivac, he knew that neither Dean nor Jeff had their minds altered so Jeff was a little puzzled by the way his relationship to Dean had changed so suddenly. Instead of a mind alteration, it was probably more about being clothes offered both of them to explore aspects of their friendship that they never thought to explore before. But Jeff was still the same old Jeff with the same old interests in women and the same old skills for attracting women. Of course his same old skills were not that great to begin with but he didn&#39;t lose anything by becoming Dean&#39;s clothes. He didn&#39;t know if he had gained anything or not but he did know that he and Dean were exploring new possibilities. He didn&#39;t know how far he wanted to take this exploration.</p>
