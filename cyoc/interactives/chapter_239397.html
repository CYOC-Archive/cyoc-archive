<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mrs. Fetco had just pulled into her parking space at her office, she had a strange feeling this was going to be an odd day. The owner and CEO of Fetco Accounting Services, she had inherited the position from her father after he passed when she was twenty five. When she had started, everyone on the board had expected the young blonde to be an air headed bimbo, she quickly proved to be sharp, and much more ruthless than her father had. Within the year she had turned the company around, marketing their services to the rich and powerful, making the entire company filthy rich. <br />
<br />
Fetco Accounting was the most desired employer in Glendale, being the most generous with pay, benefits and pensions. This wasn&#39;t to say that Mrs. Fetco hadn&#39;t indulged in the finer things, she was always dressed sharply. Now at thirty five, Fetco was the vision of beauty, having kept her body trim and fit, under her business suit was lean toned muscle, but the things that stood out about her figure were her breasts, having enhanced her bust to a much larger size that rivaled porn stars. She had decided to get implants because she wanted larger breasts, but also because it gave her an advantage, making her male clients more submissive, and using her body to her advantage, seeing her impressive cleavage usually made them sweat a little. Most of her direct clients were the males, she liked making them squirm, but today that would all change.<br />
<br />
Fetco stepped out of her care, dressed in a tight and smart business dress suit, with four inch heels, her ample bust pushed up by a slightly too small bra, her button down shirt undone just enough to show the valley of cleavage more clearly, she started walking into the building. Just then, a blur came around the corner and crashed into her, knocking her head off, her view tumbled around as she flew through the air. She could feel her headless body groping around for her head, then grab something, and suddenly she couldn&#39;t feel it anymore.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt his body for a few moments after the collision as it pawed on the sidewalk, then felt it grab something fleshy, he felt two soft hands grab his head and lift it up, then place them on something, his body now underneath him, he looked down and gasped. <br />
<br />
“Young man, what is the meaning of this?” He heard his old voice say, he looked over at the woman whose body he now possessed, he started to speak when she cut him off. “Stealing my body for your own purposes? What a power move! We could use talent like you.” She walked over to him, her now shorter body leaving her at eye level with her former bust. “Here, my card, now what&#39;s your address?”<br />
<br />
Mrs. Fetco proceeded to take control of the situation, getting his address and arranging an exchange of wardrobes, smiling the whole time as if she admired his taking her body. “Now, you have to go to school, I have to get to work. I&#39;m going to enjoy being young, and male, this should be interesting. You enjoy that body, have fun with it, I certainly did. And by the way, call me Delores, we&#39;ll talk later.” She walked off leaving Kyle standing in front of the office building dumb founded. He looked down and stared at his new bust, lifting a hand up to touch one of his new breasts it flew up and slapped him. Putting one hand on his jaw, his body then grabbed the back of his head and tried to pull him off, it&#39;s vocal cords forcing him to involuntarily scream as it did, he nearly passed out when it finally gave up. Gasping for breath he felt his body start to walk against his will, he worried about what she was going to do, she grabbed his back pack and lugged it over her shoulder. <br />
<br />
He regained control as he wobbled to school in his new heels, feeling very exposed, the now busty Kyle tried to walk to school. “Can you... help me here, I&#39;m new to heels.” One of his hands lifted up and flipped him off. “Look, we&#39;re kind of stuck with each other, you may not like it but...” His vocal cords froze up, she dropped the back pack and groped around in it, grabbing his head and pointing him downward as if to see. She grabbed his phone and started typing.<br />
<br />
“So you &#39;own&#39; me now? You really think this fucking curse is going to last for a week? I&#39;m here to stay! I much more powerful than this fucking curse, and I will take control! It&#39;s only a matter of time! I don&#39;t feel like helping you, so figure it out little piggy! Like you said, we&#39;re stuck with each other forever.” She stopped typing, let him look at it, then dropped the phone into his bag and slung it over her shoulder again. Kyle sighed and tried to walk a little while longer, nearly tripping he felt his body sigh for him, his legs snapped to attention and she pulled the phone out again.<br />
<br />
“Just look in the direction we need to walk pig.” She typed, “I&#39;ll get us there.”<br />
<br />
Kyle said nothing and did as he was told, keeping his eyes up as the personality his body possessed took control, he didn&#39;t want to piss her off. He wondered how he was going to deal with school like this.</p>
