<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Harold Anderson was a 46 year old high school english teacher. He was a kind, compassionate man, so most of his students liked him. He had a bushy moustache, glasses and a very portly build. It was that build that caught up with him a few months ago when his doctor told him that he was on the fast track to diabetes. Harold knew his options, complex medical procedures terrified him and diets never worked… which left him with his last option, trading in his current body for a new one. What this all meant is that today Harold, instead of driving to school to teach his second period class, was driving to the mall to get his new body from a body store. <br />
<br />
	The idea had really evolved and changed in Harold’s mind over the past couple of months. When he first thought about it, he was rather frightened and intimidated by the whole thing, he had never done it before and though he had friends who got new bodies every couple of weeks, Harold was nervous he’d screw it up in some way. But, as he spoke to those friends and some of his students about the process, he began to get more and more excited about getting his new body. At first he figured he would look for a male body that was his age, but then he decided it might be better to age down, why not get a few extra years out of the deal. But over the past few weeks, as his students asked him questions about his new body and his friends told him things to try, he had begun to want a young, shapely female body more than anything, so much so that he had donated most of his clothes to the local Good Will.<br />
<br />
	Harold parked his car and got out. As he took the keys in his hand, he couldn’t help but chuckle, knowing that later a very different hand would be using these keys. He walked into the mall and stopped in front of the “Nu Life” store. Headless bodies were posed in the window, spinning slowly. He took a deep breath, even though he couldn’t wait to have his new body, he knew he’d miss his own to some degree. He opened the door and entered the store.<br />
<br />
	There was only one employee behind the front register, he had the head of an asian guy in his mid 20s with shaggy hair and the body below his neck was a curvy ebony woman. He adjusted his short shorts and continued nodding his head along to whatever music he was listening to in his headphones. Harold approached the counter timidly, he was relieved that the clerk had a woman’s body so he wouldn’t think Harold was weird. He waved timidly, “Hi, I’d like to buy a new body please.” The worker glanced up and popped off his headphones. He smiled, “Well that’s what we sell here. Have you done this before or are you new?” Harold replied “I’m new.” The young guy took his high heeled feet off the counter top and strutted out to help Harold. “Okay, well it’s real simple. There’s female bodies on the right and male bodies on the left. Are you gonna exchange this one or are you just getting another?” Harold was somewhat confused “What?” “Most people exchange their current body for a new one, but we got some customers who wear bodies like clothes, so they like to have a bunch of options everyday.” Harold nodded, “Oh, well I’ll be getting rid of this one.” The worker smiled. “Cool, then just leave it in the changing room and let me know if you need any help.” Harold nodded politely and began walking towards the female section.<br />
<br />
	It was very well organized, bodies were sorted by age and had most necessary information available on a tag attached to the hangar they were on which hooked under the armpits. Harold was looking at a nice body with some pert B cups in its mid 30s, and then he was the body he just had to have. It was 23 years old, evenly tanned with a large round ass, smooth long legs and round D cup breasts. Harold caressed one of them, imagining how they’d feel bouncing around everyday as he walked around school. He took the body off the hangar and went to one of the many changing rooms. <br />
<br />
	He entered the tiny little room and locked the door. He sat the body down and paused nervously. He had heard how easy it was to pop your head off, but he had never done it. Everyone said it was painless, but maybe they were just used to it. He took a deep breath and grabbed his neck under his double chin. He pulled and there was a very muffled and slightly squishy pop. “oh my” Harold chuckled to himself as he held his head in his hands. He walked forward and put his head on the young, sexy body. All at once Harold felt a shift, everything felt so much lighter, so much easier. He brought up his new hand and looked at it, admiring his dainty little fingers with their hot pink nails. He then stood up on his new legs, they felt powerful and strong, no doubt they had done a lot of work to get his ass to be so perfectly plump. He ran his new hands over his large hips and onto his tiny waist. He had never felt a waist this fit in his life, being a virgin and a fat one at that. He then cupped his new tits and a surge of ecstasy shot through him. It felt amazing, better than anything he had felt before in his life. He stopped and stared at himself in the mirror. His own reflection with is old, fat mismatched head on his fit young female body was turning him on and his new pussy was slowly getting wetter as he ogled himself. His hands trailed down to his smooth, tight vag. He slipped a finger inside and uttered a soft little moan. He loved this feeling more than he could say. He stopped and put his hands out in front of him. “Save it, save it until I’m home.” He nodded, proud of himself for not masturbating in a mall. <br />
	<br />
	He turned to pick up his clothes and stared back at his old fat body that was now slumped lifelessly against the wall. Not only would those clothes never fit, but they were far too boring for his new body, Harold would have to really rethink his style. Harold realized that this meant he had no clothes to wear out of the store. He peered over the top of the changing room door, “Hey, can I get some help back here?” A few moments later, he heard the ‘click click click’ of the employee’s heels as he stopped outside the changing room. “What can I help you with, sir?” Harold blushed, feeling stupid about this situation. “I uh… I need something to wear.” The employee nodded “Oh yeah, lemme get you a dress and some panties, just a sec.” The employee walked over to a cabinet, opened it up and pulled out a white dress and a white thong. He flung them on top of the changing room door. “Every body comes with one outfit to wear out of here. I can get you some shoes too.” He then slid a pair of white flip flops under the door. Harold put the outfit on. The thong felt amazing, it brought a smile to his face as he felt the thin piece of fabric slide up his young, fit ass. He checked it out in the mirror briefly and then put the rest on.<br />
<br />
	He walked out of the store, his body had formed a relatively symbiotic relationship with his head already and he was actually walking in a  fairly feminine manner. He was holding his phone, wallet and keys as he approached the front register. The employee noticed Harold almost dropping his stuff and gave him a little bag for it. “So how much does this cost?” Harold said taking out his credit card. The employee chuckled, “Well, you’re doing an exchange, so it’s totally free.” Harold gasped quietly. “Really? That’s amazing.” The employee just smiled and nodded. Harold turned towards the front door, he was practically skipping with glee, his life couldn’t be more perfect. He looked back and the employee and gave him a little, cutie wave with his feminine hand. “Thank you so much!” The employee just raised his eyebrows, not used to this behavior for a simple body exchange. “No problem sir, have a nice day.” he said as he slipped his headphones back on.<br />
<br />
	Harold exited the store and looked around. All he had to wear was his little dress, panties and flip flops, he definitely needed more clothes.<br />
<br />
	Harold decided to go to…</p>
