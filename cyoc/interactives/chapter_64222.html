<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David couldn't help but feel the knots forming in his stomach. He had been working with Toby for just over 4 months now and now he has this sprung on him. He recalled all the times he would leave with his partner to investigate warehouses, strange sightings and human disappearances. He never figured that he was looking into some kind of alien conspiracy the whole time. <br />
<br />
He tried to push the thoughts from his mind, telling himself when he next saw David he would slug him good and get the whole story from him. He followed the corridor and saw the lights getting dimmer and dimmer as he moved away from the birthing chamber. <br />
<br />
He heard the sound of a door whoosh open from around the corner and he panicked. He crept slowly to the opening and peeked his head around the corner. He didn't catch the face of the person but he definitely saw a pair of woman's legs move into another passageway. From the direction she was heading, David concluded that she was moving toward the birthing chamber. <br />
<br />
Hoping this was his chance, David retraced her steps to the door he heard earlier. <br />
<br />
The door opened up to a clean basement. Judging from the shelves of food he gathered that this had to be attached to some kind of restaurant. He checked his phone. Still no signal, but he felt that if he could get to the surface then maybe he could get the message through. The door at the top of the stairs started to creak open and David lept behind the shelves to hide himself. <br />
<br />
From the top of the stairs he could make out a male voice. &quot;We had our fun hon, but you look ready to pop. Git yourself down there and look for the shiny door. Just keep heading from there and let nature take its course. When you are done maybe you can come find me again for another round.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kay!&quot; A bubbly female voice chimed in.<br />
<br />
David saw a very pregnant and very naked young woman stroll casually down the steps. She was practically skipping despite the large weight protruding from her belly. David held his breath as she passed by his location and disappeared though the doorway leading to the birthing chamber. <br />
<br />
David calmed himself and waited for the coast to clear. He inched up the stairs and slowly reached the doorway at the top. He found himself in a small backroom which opened into the local diner. <br />
<br />
Playing it as cool as he could he moved swiftly past the bathrooms and made his way to the exit. He noticed several young men eating at one of the table. The didn't seem like any of the aliens he had encountered so far. Part of him wanted to scream at them to make a run for it, but he know that the mission came first. He quickly walked past them and made his escape. <br />
<br />
Once outside in the calm breeze and sunlight, David produced his phone and was overjoyed to see 2 signal bars appear. He knew he had to get a message out and quick. Suddenly he spotted a hulking man in a police uniform checking over some of the cars parked at the diner. Their eyes met and David fled in terror into the alleyway.<br />
<br />
Despite the hulking man's size he moved swiftly and soon he was right behind David. David madly dialed on his phone trying desperately to call his home office. The hulking man grabbed David from behind and used his left hand to cover David's mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;You ain't going anywhere. Now just sit tight and I will make you forget about your lil phone call&quot;<br />
<br />
The hulking man used his right hand to start pulling down on David's pants. David's mind was in a state of panic and confusion as the scent of the burly man clutching him started to make him aroused. David shook himself out of it and looked at his phone's screen. With his one free hand he navigated to his twitter app. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the hulking man had already succeeded in getting both his and David's pants down. His hand already starting to message David's rapidly growing penis. David was rapidly typing on phone's keyboard making sure to get every letter right. He tried to ignore the fleshy organ he could feel brushing against his thigh. <br />
<br />
The hulking man pushed David's body forward and prepared to take him from behind. &quot;Oh you are gonna love this sweety!&quot; <br />
<br />
David grunted. He felt the fleshy intruder enter his body just below his ballsack. His mind started to reel from the sensations of having his genitalia pushed inside his body. He just finished typing the message as a new pulsing sensation started to center around his nipples. He felt it as weight began to form on his chest and his shirt began to stretch from the pressure. He found himself off balance and quickly moved to all fours, with the phone still clutched his smaller hand. <br />
<br />
By sheer force of will David pressed the send button. At that moment of relief he let his defenses down and his mind was assaulted by his first female orgasm. The hulking man began to fuck the new woman harder as he sensed her defeat. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am gonna earn me one hell of a medal for turning you baby. Now get ready cuz here I come!&quot;<br />
<br />
He slammed himself completely into the woman as she cried out in orgasmic pleasure as she was filled with the alien cum. As they separated, the young lady looked up at her handsome man with beautiful doe eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am not the only one who's fucked.&quot; she giggled.</p>
