<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ugh, finally...&quot;, she muttered once she found her sock and picked it up. Sitting down on her bed. Jennifer was just about to pull the sock over her foot, though, stopped in her tracks and blinked in confusion instead: &quot;Strange... I thought I shaved my legs yesterday?&quot; But currently her legs looked like as if she didn&#39;t do that for at least a week which confused her even more. Usually she&#39;d make sure to shave them every night in order to keep them as smooth as possible, but now they looked anything but smooth thanks to the new amount of hair there. <br />
Clicking her tongue in annoyance, she looked at the time. Only three minutes left until the bus would come to pick her up for school. &quot;Screw it, I need to shave them. No way in hell am I going to school with my legs looking like that!&quot;, Jennifer quickly headed to the bathroom and got her shaver ready, her now quickly trying to shave her legs. However, much to her surprise, it didn&#39;t work. <br />
&quot;What the...?&quot;, her eyes widened a little as she tried to shave her legs again. And it didn&#39;t work once again, leaving Jennifer feeling really frustrated now as she threw the shavor onto the ground whilst groaning in annoyance: &quot;You gotta be kidding me! That thing must be broken or something! I can&#39;t go to practice with legs like that!&quot; <br />
When she looked at her legs again, she could now only blink in surprise once more. Now they looked like as if she didn&#39;t shave them for at least three weeks or so. &quot;I&#39;m just... imagening that it&#39;s more hair than before because I&#39;m so frustrated. Yeah, that must be it.&quot; <br />
Biting her lip harshly, Jen then quickly rushed to her room to look outside the window. The bus luckily wasn&#39;t there yet. &quot;Maybe I still have enough time to change at least into pants.&quot;, she murmured. Opening her closet as fast as she could, Jen got out the first pair of pants she could find and pulled the skirt of her cheerleader uniform down. She&#39;d just have to lie that she wasn&#39;t feeling too good today and wouldn&#39;t be able to participate during practice for today. Then she&#39;d just get herself a new shavor and, poof, her legs would be all smooth and pretty again tomorrow. Though, she was in for yet another surprise when she opened to pull down her panties a little together with the skirt. That was a damn lot of pubic hair she saw there and Jennifer was more than just sure that she didn&#39;t have that yesterday. <br />
But she had to stop pondering over that when she suddenly heard the honking of an all too familiar bus outside. Her eyes widened and she quickly put the pants on as she then rushed out the door, almost tripping on the staircase after she got her bag and put her shoes on. Quickly running outside, she only barely made it onto the bus and went to her seat where her friend Susan was already awaiting her with a small smile.<br />
Once Jen sat down, Susan was then quick to ask: &quot;Wow, you look horrible. Did something happen?&quot; Jennifer knew that she couldn&#39;t tell Susan about that... hairy topic. That would be way to mortifying. So, instead she decided to lie and said: &quot;I&#39;m... not feeling that good today. But you know my mom. She wanted me to go to school today anyways. I hope you don&#39;t mind if I can&#39;t participate during practice today?&quot; &quot;Of course not.&quot;, Susan shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to vomit in the middle of the field or something like that after all, haha!&quot;<br />
Jen just rolled her eyes on that part. Like hell she&#39;d ever vomit in the public. That&#39;s just disgusting. <br />
Letting out a sigh, she then tried to wave some air into her face as she felt like as if it was a little too warm in the bus. However, she felt warm the most almost everywhere underneath her pants. Stupid hairs, she thought with a frown, Makes me probably even end up sweating today. Fucking great.<br />
Then her gaze wandered to her arm though and her eyes widened. &quot;Holy crap...&quot;, she whispered in shock, &quot;Now even my arm...?&quot; Even her arms looked pretty hairy now. Not so hairy that people could consider it as fur-like or something such as that, but the hair was still pretty obvious. Her arms looked like the one of a hairy man to be honest and she found that to be really disturbing. <br />
&quot;Susan...&quot;, she then began in worry and looked at her as she now decided to show her friend at least her arm, &quot;Do you see that..?&quot; The female blinked and looked at it in confusion before her gaze then wandered back to Jen as she held a blank expression: &quot;It&#39;s your arm. What about it?&quot; Jennifer looked at her in disbelief. &quot;It&#39;s all hairy!&quot;, she exclaimed in worry. Though, what Susan said next left Jennifer completely dumbfounded: &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s always been hairy.&quot; And whilst Susan looked outside the window again, Jen couldn&#39;t help but to stare at her hairy arm with still wide eyes.<br />
That wasn&#39;t good. No, that wasn&#39;t good at all. <br />
Her gaze wandered to her legs and she could feel that she was starting to sweat because she felt so warm now thanks to whatever new amount of hair was down there. Jen knew that she needed to go to the school&#39;s toilet and take a look at her legs in private. She bit her lip. Hopefully they didn&#39;t look as bad as she currently thought they would.<br />
She then shifted around the seat uncomfortably. Jennifer could feel her armpits starting to sweat as well. Then her eyes widened and she quickly moved her arm to take a look at them. Not only were there sweatpatches gracing her shirt already, she could see the big amount of hair resting there as well now. And the worst part was, there was no way to hide that big amount of hair there and her arms seemed to be even more hairy now than the first time she looked at them. <br />
Jen could feel panic rise within her. This really was starting to turn into some sort of freak show and she was even the freak. There&#39;s no way a person could grow so much body hair in not even an hour. There just was no way! <br />
But she could feel her heart sink to her stomach when she remembered the phone call with Kyle. Was she really going to turn into a god damn minotaur? Jennifer quickly shook her head. No way, that was just a stupid rumor. There was no way for that stupid curse to actually work. Whatever was going on with her, there had to be a logical explanation. Or at least that&#39;s what Jennifer hoped.<br />
Once the bus arrived at school, Jennifer ran out of it and to the girls&#39; bathroom as if her life depended on it. She could feel sweat running down her face and knew that the sweatpatches underneath her armpits were definitely bigger than before now. She could also feel the tickling sensation of all the hairs on her legs and even her pubic hair underneath the fabric of her pants.<br />
Closing the door behind her, she quickly went to check her legs and made sure to lock the door so that no one could see her in this way too mortifying state. Pulling her pants down, she needed to try her best not to scream. Her legs were so hairy by now, she could only barely see any kind of skin left and even her hips and ass were now covered under lots of hair. By now, her pubic hair seemed to have slowly krept up and surrounded even her belly button now. <br />
&quot;Oh my god.. I look like a complete freak..&quot;, she covered her mouth before then qucikly pulling her pants up again. She didn&#39;t want to look at her hairy legs any longer than she had to. It was just too terrifying for her. However, when she looked down at her shirt and saw a few small sweatpatches gracing the fabric over her breast, she could feel her heartbeat increasing as she then slowly lifted the fabric of her shirt to take a look at her boobs and was this time greeted by a great amount of chest hair gracing her. Now she really had any reason to freak out more than she already did and she began to now finally believe in the curse.<br />
Though, she then blinked when she remembered something. &quot;He said people would find me to be normal...&quot;, she began, &quot;So I should still be able to at least go to class and then figure out a way how to stop this curse...&quot; Taking a deep breath, Jen then soon enough walked out of the bathroom again and, luckily, people really didn&#39;t seem to be bothered by her appearence.<br />
And with that, Jennifer eventually began to head to class and she swore that she could feel the hair on her body to be still growing and covering up more parts of it. As she sat down on her chair, she shifted around nervously. God, she was sweating like a pig thanks to all that hair.<br />
Her gaze wandered back to her arms and she felt so very embarressed at the sight of them. The only skin left to be seen was the one on her hands and even there she could see hair to slowly start growing. Biting her lip, she soon turned her attention the teacher and tried her best to focus on the lesson, but the more hair she began to grow, the more she began to sweat and feel like as if she would end up being cooked alive today. <br />
She slowly and secretly took out a small hand mirror when she felt a tingling sensation on her face and stared in shock at her own reflection. Her whole face was covered in hair which she now really could just consider fur by then. Mortified, she buried her face in her just as hairy hands and tried to hold back her whimpers. She was a freak now. There was no denying it. And the worst part was that she wasn&#39;t even done yet with the transformation.</p>
