<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jarred was remembering the day as it unfolded, but not thinking at all in human terms. The delighted scents of cows and cattle in general drove him to run and join the herd.<br />
<br />
The herd instinct now directed his every move and action. As he reached the rim of the herd he lowered his head and began as others to graze. The act of grazing consumed the grass but also drained the mind of any humanity left. Now Jarred wandered among the cows. A sniff of those one and then that one made his bull's pink cock press out of the black hairy sheath.<br />
<br />
A young bull but still not a full sized bull Jarred tried without any success to mount cow after friendly cow.  At last the heat of the day was driving the herd to shelter under large bowed trees. Now as he laid down head to tail with others of the same breed he felt an urge to regurgitate some previously chewed grass for a calm round of chewing his cud.<br />
<br />
The sun was going down before Jarred arose and walked with the herd toward the windmill and a water trough. Cool fresh water pumped from far beneath the pasture offered a calm and content feeling. Jarred gulped and gulped the water as if it were his last drink.<br />
<br />
Now the herd milled about in a defensive mode. The young cows and bulls like Jarred were pressed to the center as older cows and bulls stood listening for preditors.<br />
<br />
Once inside the circle Jarred's friendly desires came to the forfront. As a pretty young and lucky for Jarred short cow stood swinging her tail he could not help but sniff her sweet perfume.<br />
It took only two sniffs and Jarred bounced with forelegs straddled the cows ribs. His young bull's cock sprang out with sudden force. In a second the match of male female coupling was amde and Jarred instinctively plunged into the cow's rump. Once, twice, three, then four, and a volume of bovine semen roared down his cock. The feeling was as a fire hose spewing it's load and then without a care he dropped to the ground. His moment of passion was just that a minute or four and it was only a fond memory.<br />
<br />
The night was indeed long and so was Jarred's bull cock as he mounted several more. The light of day scattered the cows and the herd began again to graze in utter peace.<br />
<br />
Jarred now took the new day as he had his second day. All the same as before like he was in tune with a clock made just for cattle. The third day and then night went as before. Day four, five, six, and then day seven all began the same.<br />
<br />
It was in the late afternoon as Jarred lay sleeping half in the setting sun he felt suddenly odd. Lifting his head he looked about to see if he had heard something or that possibly some bull's were fighting again. <br />
<br />
Nothing, yet he did feel odd. As he laid there a big cow nearby got to her feet, hooves. Jarred turned to see a river of yellow urine bust forth and splatter the ground. It was different but the cows around him seemed to be getting up and walking some distance from him.<br />
<br />
It wasn't till the sound of an approaching vehicle scattered the herd and Jarred jumped to his feet. The sudden fear he felt from the surrounding catlle made his heart beat fast. As he looked around the sight of a man creature walking toward him cause the fear flight syndrome. <br />
<br />
As Jarred bolted to run he tripped and fell to the ground. Legs scrabled from fear as the man came closer. Jarred heard the man's voice and for some reason it sounded calming and friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, easy now calm be calm I won't hurt you, easy boy easy!&quot; said the man as Jarred quivered from fear.<br />
<br />
The man knelt down aside Jarred and smoothed his hands around those hairy cheeks and chin. &quot;Easy boy easy you've had a strange time!&quot; The man's words now calmed Jarred as he was begining to understand.<br />
<br />
Jarred lay on his back and reached to touch the face of this friendly man. A strain to speak as Jarred' burbled out some half words. &quot;Easy fella you are a big amount of trouble and your ole' friend John is here to help!&quot;<br />
<br />
The words calmed Jarred as he laid easy and stopped his nervous struggling. &quot;Jarred, it's you buddy! I can see your face now and it's really you!&quot; the man said as Jarred understood him but was still unable to speak.<br />
<br />
A canteen of water offered a well wanted drink as Jarred's thick lips opened to accept the cool liquid. &quot;I...I..ah..&quot; Jarred struggled to connect words as the change to human began to happen. Minutes went by as John patted his friend's shoulder and spoke in soft and calming words.<br />
<br />
An hour and then two as Jarred regained humanity. At last he sat up as if human. Hairy hide of the Angus breed still covering him head to hooves yet he was getting more like a human on structure. Hairy buttocks against dry earth and a bull's tail still wiggled about behind Jarred.<br />
<br />
Arms had returned yet still ended in cloven hooves. A thumb extended out still looking more like a dewclaw that a human part. Legs and thighs became those of a young teen but still the black hide and hair covered them. Looking down as he tried to speak the sight of those cloven hooves on his slowly changing feet made him remember walking about on all fours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ja..John..John...Thank You John!&quot; as Jarred's jaw worked back to human and lips lost the rubbery action made perfect for grazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you, Jarred when I found you, you were a bull! I was told of the young bull found over at you house and I had to find out where such a bull came from!&quot; said John Killingsworth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..ah I found this silver Buckle and it has terrible powers attached to it, like a wishing well!&quot; spouted Jarred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get real buddy that's a fairytale!&quot; argued John.<br />
<br />
Jarred looked at his friend, &quot;Well if that's not true when was the last time you changed into a Angus bull on your Daddy's ranch?&quot; argued Jarred right back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, OK say I believe that's how this happened but where have you been for a week?  The Police and half the county is out searching for your body.&quot; asked John in a state of true wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in bed and you know how you fantasize about things, well I said something like it should make be a bull for one week. Then it glowed all bright blue. Oh I remember I had one of those brass nose rings you use on the bulls and in a moment of true fantasy I lightly poked it into my nose. Hey it's still stuck in my nose!&quot; Jarred yelled seeing his heritage for the last week.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok again say I believe this is what happened, what have you been doing for a week out here?&quot; asked a disgusted looking John K.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh John the first day was learning how a bull walks, lays and eats. Believe me I enjoyed a quarter bale of hay like it was a hamburger. I remember coughing a lot when I drank from the trough. Oh the fear, real terror fear when your Father's men put me in the truck. Ya, ya, then when we got to the ranch I remember the friendly scent of the cattle.&quot; Jarred rambled on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, friendly scent, those cows plain stink to me!&quot; said John back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no they had a neat scent especially some of the older cows, I... I... Ah, I...&quot; Jarred began to stutter as the memory of trying to mount the cows as a bull came to be more than a faint memory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya so what did you do, Oh brother did you try to have sex with cows?&quot; asked John looking terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, that's what I tried to do but they were too tall! I finally scored when the cattle herded together for the night and I was pressed against some of what you call heifers. They were willing and just the right height too! Oh there was one, she was really hot and my dic plunged so deep and her cunt grabbed it so hard I could have stayed in her much longer!&quot; stated Jarred showing his satisfied look of contentment in having sex with a cow.<br />
<br />
Then just as he explained the act of having wonderful sex his pink bull cock began to press forward. Out it came as Jarred filled in the corners of his rich sexual story. John began to back away as the rod became a pink pole held stiff in the air between them.<br />
<br />
As Jarred sat there talking a mile a minute about one heifer and then the traits of another John plopped unto his butt, mouth open in surprise. &quot;Hey Jarred' listen to yourself you sound like one of the queer beers on the interent talking about having sex with an animal. You make this all sound like being a bull was some queer adventure!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jarred then sat still and began to reflect on his week as an Abredeen Angus bull and he looked at his friend. &quot;John, you don't know the fear I had as it began! Oh but as the second day went along the beast which I was took over and guided me along. Strange, queer, and much more but as I think about it I might ask the magic buckle to do it again sometime. The freedom and yet the family feeling of being part in part of your herd was thrilling. At first time was so boring and it moved slowly but once I slipped into the manner of your herd it was just thrilling! I can't say it any better that just plain thrilling!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jarred struggled to stand up as he stood again on cloven hooves. Walking a short distance from his friend he approached a grazing cow. His bull's cock still ready for action her stepped behind the cow as she turned and lifted her boney tail. John screamed for Jarred to stop but it took only a quick move. In plunged the long pink bullish cock. Jarred began to thrust and moaned with beastial pleasures as he did so many times before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jarred no, stop man stop look what's happening!&quot; John shouted as Jarred was engrossed with the cow.<br />
<br />
As his load surged down the cock and filled a cow to feeling very pleasent he looked back at his anguished friend. &quot;Theee Tho Blubble!&quot; said Jarred as he suddenly starred in terror.<br />
<br />
John walked closer, &quot;Look at yourself, your changing back into a bull just from having sex with the cow! Your head is almost total bull and this time it's even larger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still deep in the cow with his bull's cock Jarred began to feel the wild passions surging in his veins. Now all human words had left him again as his passion somehow had started the spell all over again. The passified cow kept a tight hold on Jarred's cock as he tried to pull it from her body. Grunting as he struggled he turned to John as if asking for help.<br />
<br />
John looked at his rapidly changing friend and wondered what to pull with a tail or wrap around Jarred expanding middle. In a moment of horror and or stupidity John grabbed the pink shaft with both hands and pulled Jarred's stiff cock out of the cow's cunt.<br />
<br />
Jarred by this time was on his way to become a yearling bull and was no doubt looking the part. Quickly the forelegs came back as did the spreading thighs. In just a few minute the bull stood on all fours and lowed a sorrowful moaning for his change.<br />
<br />
John stood with hands tucked in his back pockets and announced, &quot; Hey sexy you are back to being a bull. I will check on your buckle and try to find a way to change you back but for the life of me I don't understand how this all works!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jarred approached to snuff at his friend John reached a friendly hand to scratch Jarred's hairy head. &quot;Oh damn you, you dirty bastard look at my hand!&quot; John screamed.<br />
<br />
Indeed the touch of Jarred's bull cock had transfered the spell to his good friend John. The back of John's hands were changing to blackened hide and sprouting black hairs of the Angus breed, just like Jarred.<br />
<br />
John turned and ran for his truck. Jumping into the seat he started it up and spun a dirty circle around his mooing friend. Down the service road he flew in a panic to reach Jarred's house and the silver buckle before he too wanted to sniff a cow's butt.</p>
