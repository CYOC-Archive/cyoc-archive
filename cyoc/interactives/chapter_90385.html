<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So as you can see.”  Danielle showed them the reports she’d made.  “The first phase of the plans shown to us by Mr Prometheus the last Friday are actually very low-cost, and the results are expected in short time.  As such, I see no serious risks involved with this idea up to and including this point.”  She now directed them to the point of the charts where the costs were expected to climb.  <br />
<br />
“I see.”  Joe spoke up.  “So you are recommending that we go through with this?”  <br />
<br />
“That I am.”  Danielle replied, no longer so conscious of the fact that her breasts and pussy were on display to all the others in attendance, perhaps the lack of clothing on Janet, Joe, and Richard was a reason, she surmised.  <br />
<br />
“And what of the rest of you?”  Janet asked the others.  <br />
<br />
A show of hands showed three-quarters of those in attendance choosing to support her idea to provide funding to make Mr Prometheus’s idea a reality.  <br />
<br />
“Then the idea is carried.”  Janet made the final decision.  <br />
<br />
Inwardly, Danielle couldn’t have been more delighted.  What might very well be the last great gift the old man had to give to the World, was now one vital step closer to becoming a reality.  Though she took care to not let it show.  <br />
<br />
“However, we have run these points long, therefore the item regarding the Security Upgrades proposed by Ross will have to be set as the first item in the Wednesday Meeting.”  Janet added before declaring.  “This meeting is now concluded.”  <br />
<br />
The members of the meeting rose and left, Danielle about to join them when Joe stopped her.  <br />
<br />
“I need to speak with you, in my Office.”  <br />
<br />
With only a little reluctance, she followed him as he hoped his way out of the meeting room and making the short trip to his own office, larger and better equipped than her own, owing to his greater seniority within the company.  <br />
<br />
“Have a seat.”  He offered as he removed his jacket and set it over his own seat, as he lowered his now completely nude kangaroo body into it.  <br />
<br />
“Now, there were a few small items I didn’t cover when we last spoke.”  He began once Danielle was seated.  “One item in particular, being your travel requirements.”  <br />
<br />
“I see.”  Danielle acknowledged.  <br />
<br />
“Specifically, there will be times when you need to travel to other offices within the company.  To that end, a company car will be provided to permit travel to some of these offices, while for trips that take you further afield, flights and accommodation will be arranged as needed.”  He explained to her with his clawed hands resting together on his desk.  <br />
<br />
“I understand.”  She did feel slightly apprehensive about it, but hid it well as Joe smiled at her response.  <br />
<br />
“Good.  Now there is one that will be occurring later in the week, the details will be sent to you before this workday is complete.”  <br />
<br />
“Very well.  I believe I won’t have a problem.”  <br />
<br />
“Excellent.  Now this.”  He handed her a folder.  “This contains the details of the company car that has been arranged for you.  I need not remind you that while it’s the property of the company, you will be the one responsible for it, so any serious issues will be borne by yourself with regards to it.”  He said this part sternly.  <br />
<br />
“I understand then.  I hold responsibility for the company car.”  <br />
<br />
“Very well then.  That is all.”  <br />
<br />
“Thank you.”  Danielle thanked Joe before leaving his office.  <br />
<br />
Returning to her own office, she spotted Jenny as devoid of clothing as Joe now was as she hopped over to the cafeteria, entering her office as she noted that Jodie was in just her underwear and bra now.  <br />
<br />
Pulling out lunch, she looked to see that a set of wrist bangles, a body stocking, and a pair of heels were all that Amanda wore now.  Cassie could be seen in an open shirt, and when she bent down to pick something off the floor, her tail rose in a way to show that there was nothing on underneath her skirt.  <br />
<br />
Danielle couldn’t help but chuckle to herself as she witnessed the effects of her wish in full effect, kicking off her own heels as she dug into her lunch.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
Ashlee’s day, while not as good as the one Danielle was having so far, was noticeably improving as her own lunch break began.  While she did still have a lot of work to do, she at least had the comfort of knowing that she could have it all done before the day was done.  Keeping the Pen close to her, she scanned the cafeteria she was eating in.  Kevin, she couldn’t see, but there were a few others.  Daniel, she could see taking his time with his lunch.  In fact, she knew from the grapevine that Daniel was not a hard worker, often finding ways of cutting corners and only doing the minimum required of him.  Yet he received better treatment than she’d ever had, having devised ways of keeping himself in the right circles.  <br />
<br />
While it was true that she had the Pen, and could easily correct this failing.  She hadn’t forgotten about the way she’d scolded Danielle for doing the same thing.  And as far as she was concerned, it would be more than wrong for her to repeatedly use the Pen for these things after the way she’d made her stance clear on the issue.  <br />
<br />
No, for now, she’d bite her tongue.  At least until she was home and had a talk with Danielle over the matter.</p>
