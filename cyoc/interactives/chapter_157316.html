<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Richard?”  A voice said from outside Richards office, in walked Leah Prakins, Richards secretary. She had worked for Richard for years, she had developed very strong feelings for him but since Richard was married she could never get him to budge. She didn’t quite know what love was, but she was in it for Richard. Her attempts to get him to love her back went to extreme lengths. She turned up to the office one day in a very tight blazer, her button up shirt straining hard at her breasts. She had bought breast implants. Her breasts were significantly larger. Her attempts to get Richard to love her were failing, but he would stare at her breasts all day long.<br />
<br />
She walked in, her blazer as tight as the last day. He knew she had implants, he’d secretly wanted her to be even bigger, that’s when he realised the power her now had.<br />
<br />
“Good morning Leah.”<br />
“You’re sounding awfully chipper this morning, Richard,” she looked behind him, at his desk, she noticed a small golden statue, “oh what a lovely statuette of your wife,” she examined it, “very detailed,”<br />
“Well I had it made the other day,”<br />
“Oh how lovely.” Leah had turned herself to face him, sitting on his desk, trying to look at appealing as possible to him,<br />
<br />
“Oh Leah. Aren’t you a little hot, you know some men would ‘wish your clothes were a lot tighter’,” Richard said, very clearly knowing what he was doing,<br />
“What a strange thing to say, Richard, but yes I suppose you’re right. My clothes could be a little tighter...” she pulled at her collar, noticing that it was a little tighter than usual, “sorry Richard,” she unbuttoned her blazer and put it on the back of her chair.<br />
“That’s very strange,” she walked over to the full body mirror on the back of Richards door, she looked at herself. She saw herself, but her clothes were abnormally, nearly skin tight, she saw the shape of her large implant breasts. She saw Richard eying her down, she began to pose in the mirror, maybe this was her day, she had finally convinced him to fall in love with her.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you ever ‘wish your breasts were real’?” Richard said,<br />
Leah was a little shocked by this remark, she looked down at her breasts. Unexpectedly she saw them soften a little. She poked them, they were squishy, not firm, “holy shit!” She yelled,<br />
“What is it?” Richard pretended to be clueless,<br />
“My breasts! They’re real!!” Leah said,<br />
“Wow! Maybe because you wished they were, it happened,”<br />
“Maybe. But if I could make wishes. I’d know by now. Like, I wish my butt was bigger,” she paused, waiting, “see, nothing.”<br />
<br />
“Well. I ‘wish you could get what you wanted to come true,’” Richard said,<br />
<br />
“So do I Richard, so do...” Leah was about to say, before she felt her pants become tighter, “what the...” she looked at her rear. She saw it growing. It pushed out further and further, fattening, inflating. She grabbed it with both of her hands, the feeling of it growing was so amazing.<br />
<br />
RIP!!<br />
<br />
Leah grabbed her butt again. She spun around and looked at herself in the mirror. She saw her expanded butt, and also a very large rip down the back of her pants. Her white panties were showing.<br />
<br />
“My butt!!” She kept looking at it, trying to pull the broken halves of the back of her pants together, “did I do this!?” Leah questioned aloud,<br />
“I guess you did...” Richard said. Leah went bright red, she had completely forgotten that Richard was in the room with her. She spun around, hiding her exposed (and much larger) rear from Richard. He could clearly see it in the mirror but he wasn’t going to tell her that. Richard took note that her butt had grown, but her hips had not. Her butt stuck out like a shelf. “Amazing. It looks like you’re able to make wishes,” Richard said, ironically fiddling with the rock behind his back,<br />
“Yeah. If I’m making wishes, I probably have a limit, so I shouldn’t waste them on small silly things like the size of my butt,”<br />
“Well... I wouldn’t say it’s a waste,” Richard looked at her butt, she blushed again,<br />
“Well... I guess...” Leah stuttered, “if it’s not a waste. I guess I wish my boobs were bigger... too...”<br />
“Good choice, Leah. If I were you I’d ‘wish the same thing upon myself,’” Richard said.<br />
<br />
Leah looked at the mirror, right at her now real boobs, waiting for them to start growing even bigger. They didn’t, she kept watching, waiting, hoping. She saw in the corner of her eye, Richards button up shirt began to shift slightly. She guessed it was nothing. But it kept moving, it kept... pushing. She turned to look at Richard,<br />
“What is it...” Richard said, Leah pointed to his chest, he looked down, “oh fuck...” he saw watched as a button flew off. Revealed was his cleavage through the open hole in his shirt. Both him and Leah watched as his brand new breasts grew. They finally stopped at DD size. Richard walked to the mirror, he looked at himself. He poked it slightly. They were oddly sensitive, unlike before.<br />
<br />
“Wait...” Leah said, “I said I wish I had bigger boobs... why did you get boobs?”<br />
“Well I’m sure you said—“<br />
“Hold on! You said you wished it upon yourself! You’re the one making wishes!” Leah said,<br />
<br />
Richard let go of his breasts, and turned to face Leah, “looks like the gig is up,” he grinned, “‘I wish I didn’t have boobs’,” he said, his breasts began deflating until they were no longer there,<br />
“So what are you going to do with your wishes?”<br />
<br />
“Oh... you’ll see,”</p>
