<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was so fired up after he had transformed Jim and Dave. He was amazed how easy it was to modify their <br />
bodies. All he had to do was issue a command or to make a wish in silence or out loud and reality would change <br />
in an instant right before his very eyes… like magic! He truly marveled his cool, divine powers and hoped to <br />
meet other guys from school so he could change them right there and then.<br />
<br />
As an answer to his wish (you wonder why!), Ty spotted a young man from a distance who was walking right <br />
towards him! This was a teenager, about sixteen years old, with jet-black hair, short and spikey, and he had <br />
brown eyes and a nice, light complexion. The boy was about the same height as Ty, and he was slender at about <br />
5 foot 6 inches tall. He wore a red tank top and blue shorts with white high tops, much like a basketball <br />
player. The tank top looked rather baggy on him, but that was his usual style. Ty immediately recognized the <br />
boy as Zach, a shy, goofy kid in his class who aspired to be a jock but often acted like a geek just because <br />
he was too short and too slender.<br />
<br />
“Yo, Ty! What’s going on?” the boy said, as he walked up to Ty.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Zach! What are you doing here in the mall? Aren’t you usually hanging out at the football field? Or the <br />
basketball court?” <br />
<br />
“Yeah… But I got some gift cards for my birthday last week so I figured it was time to spend the loot!” the <br />
shy boy grinned. “Hey, do you want to go to the sporting goods store with me?”<br />
<br />
“Sure! What do you plan on getting there?” Ty wondered.<br />
<br />
“I was going to buy some dumbbells and some weights to add to my bench at home! You know… So I can build more <br />
muscle!” Zach grinned.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Well… Building muscle is my favorite thing, dude!” Ty responded. “I can help you out with that!”<br />
<br />
“Huh? Do you work out, too?” <br />
<br />
“Kinda… Sorta…” Ty grinned. “Zach! Come stand over here! Right in front of me!”<br />
<br />
Zach curiously walked right up to Ty, thinking that Ty was going to show him something.<br />
<br />
“What do you got? Show me?”<br />
<br />
“It’s YOU, Zach! I wanna see some muscle… on YOU!” Ty laughed. “I wish your muscles would grow!”<br />
<br />
Zach’s jaw dropped wide open. He felt something ruble inside of him. Then he felt his muscles grow… Every one <br />
of them! From his legs to his arms and everywhere in-between, every muscle fiber in the boy’s body began to <br />
expand at an exponential rate, only because Ty had wished for it to happen! <br />
<br />
On his legs, Zach’s quads began to fill out his shorts! His quads grew thicker, wider, deeper and slightly <br />
longer while they stiffened up and hardened at the same time. Pound after pound of muscle was magically added <br />
to his growing quads, as thick veins began to surface just under his paper-thin skin. Zach could feel the <br />
strength in his legs increase in the part above the knees as his thick legs exploded with incredible muscle, <br />
making him look like a professional cyclist or a rugby player!<br />
<br />
Zach’s quads weren’t the only things that grew! Below the knees, his calves began to inflate as well, growing <br />
into big, round, hard diamonds of rock-solid footballs that were sticking out from the back of his legs, which <br />
were now becoming as thick and as wide as tree trunks! Two thick spheres of round, hard muscle appeared <br />
fighting for space on the back of each leg, giving the teenager a vertical leap that would make any runner or <br />
basketball player cringe with envy!<br />
<br />
His abdominals transformed from a flat surface which covered his stomach into a valley of buttons of rows and <br />
columns that looked like a bottom of a washboard, with all the valleys and ridges sticking out everywhere and <br />
all the neatly lined-up rows and columns of tiles like a kitchen floor or a tiled bathroom wall. <br />
<br />
His pectorals inflated just like the oval-shaped balloons that you see at parties and celebrations. Like air <br />
being pumped into them, his pecs pushed outwards and sideways, growing bigger and bigger while becoming harder <br />
and thicker at the same time as well. But these pecs were not being filled with air! They were filled with <br />
more muscle! Zach could feel the strength increase in his chest, the same way he sensed the increased strength <br />
in his legs.<br />
<br />
Finally, his biceps, triceps and delts all inflated as well, leaving the boy sporting massive spheres of <br />
thick, heavy muscles all over his arms and shoulders! He immediately realized the increased strength in his <br />
arms the moment he flexed them and just tried to raise them up or just move his fingers even the slightest! <br />
Super strength was at his command, thanks to the increased muscles all over his shoulders, his neck, his arms, <br />
his lats, his chest, his entire torso, and his legs! Truly, Zach now looked like a professional bodybuilder <br />
but at the age of a teen!<br />
<br />
“Whoa… Wowwww!” he gasped, while looking down at his arms. “Look at this! Are these MY MUSCLES?”<br />
<br />
Ty just grinned as he watched Zach turn and flex his right arm, causing a bicep the size of a bowling ball to <br />
rise up from his arm.<br />
<br />
“Told ya I was gonna help ya, Zach!” Ty giggled. “Now, look how big you are!”<br />
<br />
Zach realized that his tank top was almost at the point of ripping and his shorts were about to tear at the <br />
seams.<br />
<br />
“Yeah but now I’m gonna have to blow all my money on buying new clothes!” the muscle kid groaned.<br />
<br />
“No you don’t! All your clothes will grow to fit your muscles!” Ty stated. “I promise!”<br />
<br />
Instantly, Zach’s shorts adjusted to fit his huge torso and muscular legs, and his tank top grew three sizes <br />
bigger to accommodate his bigger chest and abs!<br />
<br />
“Cool! This is much better!” Zach cheered. “So… Do you still want to go to the sporting goods store with me?”<br />
<br />
“Sure! Let’s go!”<br />
<br />
Then Ty and Zach walked into the sports store, where all the sales people gawked at the ordinary student and <br />
the huge muscle kid, who came to browse at the exercise equipment…</p>
