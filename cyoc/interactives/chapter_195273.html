<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been an interesting first day of classes. Quillson had liked and even stamped off on his photo project, though did tell him for the sake of the school that some of those photos may have to remain part of a private collection. They had all gathered in the third floor lounge, taking up a couple couches and a table. It was more comfortable than squeezing everyone into a dorm room. Milo tapped the end of his snout as he read through his Anthro homework. He thought he would be weirded out when it grew in, but it felt so natural, and it was surprisingly sensitive. Not just to smells either, to touch. It felt so good to burrow it into Dare&#39;s neck fur last night. He looked over to where the human-turning-skunk was working on his own Anthro homework. There was almost no blond left in his hair, but his eyes were still that same brilliant green he had noticed on their first day.<br />
<br />
He liked Dare, but it seemed like every time they took a step towards having a relationship, Dare eventually took a step back. Last night seemed to be a new equilibrium where he was more okay with it in private, but public gestures were rebuffed. In fact, all six of them were obviously pairing off. &quot;Have you guys noticed...&quot; Milo started looking up from his book. &quot;That there seem to be a lot of gay couples on campus? Or am I imagining it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the others looked at each other, but a voice spoke up from else where in the lounge where Stripes sat working on his own assignments. &quot;You&#39;re not imagining it. There are.&quot; Stripes looked up from his work and set his pen down, stretching his arms over his head. &quot;This world has it in a far higher ratio than the human world, and it&#39;s not just that we&#39;re more open to sexuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You&#39;re saying this is some sort of gay paradise?&quot; Dare said with a bit of a clipped tone, just on the verge of being mocking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda.&quot; Stripes nodded with a shrug. &quot;Happens in rates of about three to four times higher than the human world. Near on half the population. Prevailing theory is it&#39;s a natural population control because we&#39;re also more prolific breeders, about double humans. If you do the math, we have about the same amount of kids per mated pair, about 2.1 to 2.4. You&#39;ll find out most of us have big families with lots of siblings. The aunts and uncles without kids are also more likely to pitch in to help raise their siblings&#39; kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stripes looked back at the group of Freshmen and the stares he was getting. &quot;You asked.&quot; Well, except Curt and Todd, they were looking anywhere but at Stripes, like what they heard wasn&#39;t quite what they had been expecting.<br />
<br />
Milo looked down at the book in his hands. Families, huh? Wouldn&#39;t that be nice. His phone buzzed from where it sat on the table and Milo stared at it. The only people who would text him were right here, and though Ollie was involved in something on his phone, he doubted it&#39;d be him.  He reached out and flipped it over.<br />
<br />
Dad<br />
If you still want a part-time job, I know the mechanic in town. He&#39;s willing to bring you on part time if you swing by. Love you.<br />
<br />
Milo&#39;s hand trembled as he held the phone. His parents, his actual parents he could barely remember, but now there was something else sitting there that came up unprompted as he read the message. A big man, with strong hug and a loud laugh. The smell of engine grease and motor oil strong in his nostrils. A look of pride on a snouted visage. It made him feel warm and hollow at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Milo?&quot; Dare spoke his name so softly, with such worry, it took him a moment to even realize it was Dare. He looked up, the others were looking his way, too, all distracted from their homework. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, need a second.&quot; He scrambled to his feet and almost ran to the dorm room, slamming the door behind him and leaning back against it. He wiped the tears from his cheeks with the back of his hands. It was too much all at once. He kept reading and rereading the message, and the more he did the clearer the picture in his head became.<br />
<br />
There was a soft knock on his door and he composed himself as best he could before he answered it, half expecting Dare. But it was Stripes who stood there. &quot;Everything okay?&quot; He asked in his gentlest tone. Milo held out his phone and it took Stripes a moment before it dawned on him. &quot;Ah, I see. You&#39;re remembering something new, aren&#39;t you? Normally it&#39;s not a strong memory, I guess this must be like a kick in the pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Milo only managed to nod as he sat on his bed. Stripes sat next to him, making the bed groan a little under both of them. &quot;You want to talk about it?&quot; Stripes offered, handing back the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy, I.. I know the man I&#39;m remembering and I love him, but I don&#39;t even know him. And I feel guilty.&quot; Milo looked over to his camera, feeling that hollowness in his stomach, ashamed that he can barely remember his actual parents and yet this memory was becoming clearer by the second.<br />
<br />
Stripes gave a slow nod. &quot;I get it. But don&#39;t. You&#39;ll remember them, still, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;d want you to be happy. I mean, look at this like getting adopted. Just because you&#39;ll have a new family doesn&#39;t make the old one any less a part of you.&quot; Stripes gave him a light nudge. &quot;What&#39;s he like? Tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strong, but kind. Loud. Really loud.&quot; Milo closed his eyes, letting the memory soak into him. &quot;Grease and oil, a mechanic I think. I can remember a smile. Him being proud that I got into college, beaming, a tight hug.&quot; Milo took a deep shuddering breath then shook his head. &quot;That&#39;s it. Just that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds pretty nice.&quot; It wasn&#39;t Stripes that spoke but Dare, who stood in the doorway. &quot;Sorry, Ollie suggested I come check on you. Didn&#39;t know sheep could guilt you with a stare.&quot; He looked at Stripes as if contemplating even wanting to speak his next words. &quot;All I remembered was ice cream and butt surgery so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way Stripes kept his face neutral was admirable. Milo snorted a short laugh. &quot;I&#39;ll let you two talk.&quot; Stripes said as he stood, but Milo grabbed him by the wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;What will they think of me?&quot; Milo asked anxiously, and Stripes furrowed his brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess that depends on your relationship with them, but it sounds good.&quot; The zebra offered, trying his best to sound reassuring.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not like that.&quot; Milo shook his head, trying to piece the question together in a way that made sense. &quot;I&#39;ll remember my old life, but also the new right? But what will they remember? A life without me and suddenly I&#39;m there, or..&quot;<br />
<br />
Realization dawned on Stripes face as Dare&#39;s expression turned to one of thoughtfulness. Obviously he hadn&#39;t thought on this too much. &quot;Well, from what I know with my own family, and what Max has shared, they won&#39;t really remember life without you. You&#39;re changing worlds, to them, you&#39;re adding to theirs. I&#39;m not sure how it works, no one is, but the only way they&#39;ll ever know is if you tell them.&quot; Milo released Stripes hand. &quot;Call them if you want. But maybe tomorrow, once you&#39;ve calmed down. Actually meeting the new family will cause a lot of memories to form so be ready for a very confusing talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dare sat on his bed, facing Milo, trying to look supportive, but he looked like he suddenly had his own set of worries. Probably thinking about his own family to be. Stripes left, closing the door gently behind him.<br />
<br />
Milo met Dare&#39;s eyes and saw him smile. &quot;Need a hug?&quot;<br />
<br />
Milo felt his face burst into a grin and a small laugh escape him, but he nodded the affirmative and Dare slipped from his bed and sat next to Milo, wrapping his arms around his shoulders. &quot;Dare. I have a family.&quot; He hugged the phone to his chest and rocked a little on the edge of the bed as he leaned into the skunk, even though he was the slightly bigger one now. &quot;A family.&quot;</p>
