<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Damn, you are huge. I can&#39;t believe even my bras are too small for you.&quot; Says your Mom in disbelief. You are trying your best to squeeze into one of her bras, but it is just no use. &quot;Your boobs are just too massive. You must be at least F cups if I had to guess.&quot; She says with a slight grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not something that makes me happy to hear you know. I never wanted to have them in the first place&quot; you argue. But your mom seems to be stuck inside her own world at the moment and does not hear your comment. &quot;I&#39;ll bet that you have the largest pair in your grade too. I bet all of the boys won&#39;t stop looking at you. Especially today since you won&#39;t have a bra on. At best I can lend you one of my bikinis and hope it stays tied, or we can put some tape over your nipples. Any preference?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I want them gone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense. Why would you ever wish to ruin such a perfect look? Normally having boobs that size on your body&#39;s frame, makes them look almost comically large. But somehow on you they don&#39;t look out of place at all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But they both are nearly the size of my head... and they are heavy to boot. And, and I think I can feel some liquid inside of them too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mom gets a concerned look on her face once you say this. And after a few moments of thinking, she responds. &quot;Well, that sometines happens. Especially when girls have an excess of hormones, which given your current predicament, is of little surprise. Actually it would sorta be more shocking if you were not lactating. Your body should be way past overflowing with hormones that it usually shouldn&#39;t have in that high of quantity. Thats my guess at least. But either way, you should get use to carrying around an extra bra and top with you just in case you start leaking while out in public.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uughh that just sounds really annoying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t say that it isn&#39;t inconvenient at times, but the overall process can be very enjoyable. At least when I was breast feeding you, I didn&#39;t mind it at all. And I found the milk extracting process to be enjoyable if not pleasurable. So don&#39;t worry about it too much. I will grab you a pump while I am out. Just use it about an hour or so before you have to go anywhere and you should be fine for a long time, at least that was what my Mom taught me. Now, bandages, tape or bikinis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bandages I guess? I don&#39;t know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try the bikinis first as they may work out. If they do not, we can do bandages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, whatever.&quot; You say as you are handed 2 pairs of bikini tops. The first pair just has an elastic strap around your back and the strings only are their for the looks and to keep the top of the cups from sinking down. Needless to say, it didnt fit at all. Your boobs bairly were being contained by the tiny cups and were possibly making you look even more erotic than if you just went braless. The other one was one where you tied it in the front and actually fit you pretty well. If it was considered to be a microkini, which it clearly wasn&#39;t supposed to be. That was just how large your boobs were. Like having 2 bowling balls attached to your chest. At least they felt nice to touch and rub... and at least it did technically fit, albeit bairly. Walking was much easier now too, as now you were not being thrown off balance quite as much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it will have to do for now. I will pick you up from school and we can go shopping then. Now let&#39;s see if anything I own will fit you.<br />
<br />
In the end, you managed to squeese into a tight t-shirt that was never meant to be a crop top, but now was. This left your midriff showing, but that would be something you would just have to deal with for today. It was too warm for a hoodie or a jacket as well, so there was just no avoiding it. The school never had any issues with or rules against it either for as long as you could remember, so that was that. <br />
<br />
Reluctantly, you were &quot;dressed&quot; now. Being forced into a skirt since not a single pair of pants in the house fit you. Your ass was either too big, waist too narrow, legs too long, etc... they only thing that managed to somehow fit you perfectly was your sister&#39;s miniskirt. None of her clothing fit you either, as she was far smaller than you are breast wise, and while she was about as tall as you are now, she has different sizes still for her pants. Only this skirt fit you, and you knew why she had bought it. It was meant to be a publicly worn outfit piece, but it was also something she had bought to celebrate her boyfriend&#39;s birthday with, in private. In other words, you felt that it was a bit slutty. The right half was far shorter than the left, bairly covering your waist and right thigh. It looks like something you could wear to the beach though, so you knew it was not specifically fetish wear. Your Mom had called it a sarong or something. Either way it is basically a mini skirt, which shows off your hairless long legs nearly in full. <br />
<br />
And finally, because of course your shoes don&#39;t fit, you are stuck wearing the only pair in the house that does. Your sisters pair of white 3 inch, high heeled sandles. You look as if you are heading out to the beach instead of school. Then again, your school is partially beach front property, so most girls wear something like this when it is a nice and warm day, like today unfortunately is.<br />
<br />
You have breakfast and before you were about to leave your mom pulls you back into her room and does your hair and adds a very small amount of makeup as you really didn&#39;t need much, if any applied to begin with. You suspect that she is having a bit too much fun. She did always want another daughter after your older sister left the house. <br />
<br />
As you have missed the bus and walking would take far too long, she gives you a ride as well, and spends the entirety of it lecturing you on how to be a girl. Mainly always cross your legs while sitting down and don&#39;t ever bend over at the waist, especially in front of boys. Stuff like that. It is all very uncomfortable to listen to, knowing that this is your life for now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, stop doing that too.&quot; Says your mom as she slaps your hand away from your boobs. &quot;I know they are yours and you can legally touch them whenever, but not while in public.&quot; You put your hand down. You wanted to really just play around with them for a little as they were feeling a bit cramped. &quot;They feel cramped though&quot; you argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cramped? Oh... hey, can you skip your first class by chance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, I have a test.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, uh... try not to rub them or squeeze them too much then. And then after you are done with the test, give me a call and I will come pick you up. Ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Sure? I guess I can do that. Why though?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your cramped feeling is likely your breasts nearing their capacity. Meaning that soon you&#39;ll need to pump them. As you do not own one, I will pick you up so that you can get, one or at least so that you don&#39;t have to walk around with a milk filled top for the rest of the day.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, you will get use to this I am sure. Now, good luck on your test and call me when it is over with. I will handle the school about your attendance and such. And remember, your name is currently Gwendolyn. Gwen is fine too, but Greg is a no go for now. I love you.&quot; Says your mom as you step out of the car. You already can feel some glances pointing towards you. And before you could even turn around, someone reaches around your side and pulls you underneath their arms. Before suddenly letting go and taking a few steps back.</p>
