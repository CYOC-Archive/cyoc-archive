<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan looked at his three ginger pups, lined up and at attention. Dan was swimming in his own<br />
really life fantasy. He knew he was going to have to get a larger bed to<br />
accommodate all three of them. Despite this, something troubled him at the back<br />
of his mind . They all bore his locks, that was obvious. The shining, thick<br />
metal hanging heavily around their necks.<br />
<br />
He inspected his submissive further from left to right. They all towered over Dan:<br />
Patrick, the first of his submissives. He had richly deep blue eyes surrounded by blonde<br />
eyelashes. Since the competition his red hair had grown down to his waist,<br />
which he had tied back into a ponytail. His beard, a ferocious shade of red<br />
growing down to his belly button had been platted neatly. He wore his usual kilt,<br />
doing nothing to hide his immense pierced meat. Of the three, Patrick  was<br />
the most solidly built, with a firm and perfectly round belly which protruded<br />
several feet infront of him – 12 feet in circumference at last measurement.<br />
Above his massive belly rested to solid pierced orbs that were his pecs. His<br />
massive weight giving him a swagger in his walk. Personality wise Patrick was<br />
probably the most easygoing and agreeable, he could sometimes be clumsy but he<br />
was always well intentioned. He earned a quiet respect from his peers.<br />
<br />
Marcus, the second of his submissives, was undeniably Patrick’s brother.  He had a<br />
different facial structure, but was otherwise carbon copy of his brother’s<br />
body. Personality wise he was more aggressive and sharp than his brother,<br />
commanding a more direct respect. All the bravado that he used to carry around<br />
with him had transformed into sheer determination to carry out his orders. If<br />
Patrick were like a guide dog- patient and helpful, Marcus was like guard dog -<br />
ferociously loyal and bull-headed. Presently he was wearing a skin tight black<br />
wrestling suit, accentuating every one of his ample curves. His belly protruded<br />
roundly outwards, the cut of the suit accentuating the valley between his furry<br />
pecs and the shelf of his large muscular arse. The coup de gras was how his<br />
massive cock and balls struggled to be contained in the suit. It looked like a<br />
python had been stuffed down the legs of his pants.  <br />
<br />
The last and newest of his new family was Angus. Dan had discovered he had been a recent<br />
transfer to this city, spending most of his life in a smaller country town<br />
where there weren't many other red-heads, few people to teach him first hand<br />
about what his life had in store for him as a ginger in this world. Unlike<br />
Marcus and Patrick who had come from proud kin-groups of gingers. Angus’s<br />
genetic heritage was recessive. His dads had tried to shelter him as best they<br />
could, fearing a man as handsome, as loving and as caring as he could easily<br />
and hopelessly fall for the wrong Master.<br />
<br />
After school he would tell his dads he was going to the library to study, which was true,<br />
but instead of learning English he would sit himself down in the small<br />
“Ginger-Interest” and read anything remotely relevant to him. He would absorb<br />
all the handbooks on service, the fiction featuring Masters, anthropological<br />
articles of the all ginger clans of Scotland, Iceland and Norway scientific<br />
journals detailing the physical and chemical changes occurring when a ginger<br />
finds his true Master.  When his teenage years he maintained a regular<br />
build to his peers. He was seldom bullied in high school, but rarely bonded<br />
with other people out of sheer disinterest. He would prefer to read his books<br />
and write his fantasies and go to the gym alone. As his ginger genes activated<br />
Angus continued growing larger and larger, stronger and stronger, his cravings<br />
to serve screaming for urgency. He would constantly eat and outgrow his<br />
clothes.  He would He would compare himself to the gingers in the books<br />
and magazines finding that not only was he taller but also much more muscular<br />
than the norm.<br />
<br />
Angus stood straight up between Marcus and Patrick. While not having as large a belly as<br />
either of them, he was a clear head taller with the both of them. His massive<br />
thighs fit like a wetsuit on his skimpy cargo shorts. His zipper undone and the<br />
contents of his jockstrap pouring out, this was not a fashion statement. These<br />
were the loosest pants he owned, he was one of the largest gingers on campus<br />
and he was still growing! The only other thing Angus wore were sneakers and suspenders<br />
that only emphasised the immensity of his chest and shoulders.<br />
Dan admired his three gingers, all massive, all incredibly loyal and all his. The longer he kept them standing <br />
there the fuller and larger their balls got, that fact was visually noticeable. Dan could smell the sweaty <br />
musk coming out of their pores, each of his three submissives had their own variation but they all carried the <br />
natural fragrance of taken ginger.<br />
Having such power and control was such a head rush for Dan. The more Dan craved and the more he took the more <br />
these gingers wanted to give. It was intoxicating unlike anything he had experienced before.   <br />
<br />
This was the first time Dan had all of his gingers together, something didn’t seem quite<br />
right. Each of his gingers had different clothes, they wore their hair and<br />
beards differently. These were the hand-me-downs from their former selves. If<br />
they were to be his pups they needed to abandon everything from their own lives<br />
and give them over to the infinite benevolence of their New Master. If they<br />
were to be Dan’s property they needed to look the part – all the time. People<br />
needed to know they were his property of Master at any time during the day or<br />
night, for every day for the rest of their lives. Dan wanted to send a clear<br />
message. He needed to brand his bulls.<br />
<br />
<br />
They needed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patrick stood before his Master, lined up with his brothers in service.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patrick had been recently entrusted with the responsibility of being Angus’s alpha. It<br />
wasn’t all that long ago that Patrick was living all the time as an Alpha, the<br />
bear that every man on campus wanted to have, every man on campus wanted to be.<br />
All that seemed different now, as though Patrick were getting flashes of<br />
memories that belonged to someone else. In a way that was true, when Patrick<br />
saw Dan his life was forever changed, he knew that he had found the one for<br />
whom he would serve for the rest of his life, his fate sealed when the padlock<br />
went around his neck. It was the best thing that ever happened to Patrick.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How long had it actually been since had become his Master’s submissive? Patrick wondered. Since<br />
being collared time wasn’t divided into seconds, minutes, hours or days. Time<br />
had been divided into when he was with his Master and times when his Master was<br />
away. The times he was with his Master seemed euphoric, no matter how long it<br />
was it was never enough, the time his Master being away seemed unbearable, a<br />
feeling his own existence and sense of self becoming undone in the absence of<br />
his Master.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patrick thought about those days being the Alpha bear on campus, being president of<br />
powerlifting club, the captain of the debating team, shooting down his<br />
opponents with his sharp mind and fierce intelligence. These days Patrick could<br />
barely hold a thought that didn’t have something to do with serving his Master,<br />
nor could Patrick maintain a conversation with others for too long with others<br />
without growing frustrated. Patrick soon shrunk away his old world, only<br />
speaking when spoken to, everything but his Master and his interests fading<br />
into a soft focus.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The parts of Patrick that were an Alpha were long, long gone, completely surrendered to his<br />
Master. His place in life was as a pure-Beta and there was no go going back.<br />
Yet somehow Patrick  was to act as the Angus’s Alpha, it was his duty, it<br />
was a direct order.  If he were guide Angus, it would be the only way he<br />
knew how – with love. Patrick would guide Angus to understand what it means to<br />
truly know the joy in his Master’s service.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since adorning his Master’s collar Patrick emotions like jealousy, or spite, or anger, or<br />
resentment had disappeared from the breadth Patrick’s emotional spectrum. These<br />
were feeling were not capable of feeling. All Patrick understood now was<br />
loyalty, love, commitment,  the elation of making his Master happy and<br />
lasting fear of doing anything to displease him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patrick’s thoughts flickered to Angus. While Angus was surprised his Master would take another submissive so<br />
quickly, there was no denying why Master had selected him. Patrick only had<br />
eyes for his Master, but could also recognise qualities in Angus that had<br />
endeared him with to his Master. From their first meeting, Patrick could tell<br />
that Angus was a man with a kind heart and a gentle soul, this was accompanied<br />
by the deepest green eyes he had ever seen.  He had a puppy dog manner<br />
about him, standing in great contrast to the physical immensity of his size.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be a pleasure to serve alongside him.</p>
