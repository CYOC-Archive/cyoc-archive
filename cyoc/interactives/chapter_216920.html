<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miranda held her breath as she walked into the club which if the manager accepted her would be her job/home/ her entire life for the next 10 years and earn her more then enough money to pay for college, buy a house, a car and still have some left over to restart her human life at the age of 29. That was ten years in the future however, right now she was a 19-year-old who was about to change her life forever.<br />
<br />
The Siren’s call club sat in the middle of the mermaid lagoon area in the main mythtopia park, an under the sea ride, viewing areas for paying guests to watch mermaids and mermans swim around and other stuff one would find in a theme park. It was all extremely nice and well themed since this was not just a theme park but a home for the workers.<br />
<br />
“Follow me.” Said the staff member, a blue skinned elf which had a set of gills behind the ears. Almost all the staff members walking around where elves or other nearly humanoid creatures, but Miranda spotted a few mermaids and merman cleaning the inside of the pools while the park was still hours from opening.<br />
<br />
Inside the club, Miranda breath was taken, it was beautiful. Designed like some sort of underwater cave, but in a classy way, there where large pools on three sides where mermaids and merman could swim up to the glass and perform but along those sides where open area pools with islands in them so the mermaids and merman could get right up next to the guests. Multiple tables filled the center with a larger pool in the front with a clear open back which had sharks and other fish swimming in a coral reef. <br />
<br />
She was lead backstage and through an underwater tunnel where she saw the most mermaids and merman she had ever seen in her life. Not that it was high number to reach, resting talking with each other and acting like any normal coworkers would when they arrived for their shift in the morning. All the mermaids where breathtaking beautiful and the merman where so handsome they put professional models to shame. Their tales came in multiple different colors and types, from the classic mermaid tail, to shark and eel tales to what looked to be an octopus tail. <br />
<br />
They turned and looked at her and most of them waved but others paid her no attention. <br />
<br />
Her eyes widened as she saw a pair of mermaids taking part in a hot make out session.<br />
<br />
The guild turned and lead Miranda into a small office, it was strange because along the back wall was pool which went to about waste height and a desk covering half of it. An older mermaid sat behind the desk, working on a waterproof tablet as she did paperwork. She reminded Miranda of a school principle only no school principle would wear a tight leather corset which pushed up her massive breasts while a pair of reading glasses rested on her nose. <br />
<br />
“Ah…morning, you must be Miss Miranda Lilac.” Greeted the mermaid with a surprising amount of warmth in her voice.<br />
<br />
“I am.” Confirmed Miranda <br />
<br />
“I am Mrs. Reed, I manage the Siren club and I am so happy you have decided to join our team.” Said Mrs. Reed. “Now before you go to the transformation center to become a full member of our staff, we like to show you where you will be working so you can change your mind if you want.”<br />
<br />
“I know.” Said Miranda<br />
<br />
“Well the Siren’s club one of the top restaurant and experiences in the entire park, we perform all day for guests, with songs, underwater dances and other performances.” Stated Mrs. Reed. “It says in your resume that you can sing?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I took sinning lessons for years.” Confirmed Miranda <br />
<br />
“Can you show me.” Inquired Mrs. Reed as Miranda took a breath and began to sing. A smile crossed Mrs. Reed face. Her smile only widened as Miranda switched to singing a Korean Pop song, in full Korean. “I was about to ask, it says you can speak Korean, Spanish and Japanese.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, but I do have trouble singing in Japanese.” admitted Miranda, her parents had been Korean and she had learned Japanese from of all things, anime and she had taken Spanish in school. <br />
<br />
“Slightly disappointing but being able to sing in Korean and Spanish will make you a top performer with ease and earn you extra money.” stated Mrs. Reed<br />
<br />
“Really?” inquired Miranda <br />
<br />
“Of Course, now this isn’t like a normal job. We work 5 days a week and the park is open 7 days a week so you will work weekends and our shift is 8 to 10 hours a day.” Explained Mrs. Reed as Miranda nodded her head. “We have three shifts. We normally start newbies on days but if you are ok with it and you would make the most money then working nights is where you want to be.”<br />
<br />
“Why would working nights affect me? I am normally a night person after all.” stated Miranda<br />
<br />
“Well, you have to understand from when the park opens at 9 am to 9pm we are the classic family friendly dinner show.” Explained Mrs. Reed. “Then we reopen at 10pm and close at 3 or 4 am and our shows are no longer family friendly, we are talking open tops, strip shows, make out sessions and other stuff you would find in a strip club or a sex club. We even have private rooms where those who are willing can give paying customers a private show or something along the lines of a hand or blow job if they want. We even have a few couples both straight and gay/lesbian who do full sex shows in-front of paying customers.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Said Miranda slightly taken aback.<br />
<br />
“With your singing ability you would more then likely be a stage performer but there is a lot of cross over so you may end up there and no one if forced to take part in the private shows.” Reassured Mrs. Reed “So are you still interested?”</p>
