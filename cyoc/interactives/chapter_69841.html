<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just before Sidney arrived at Jon’s house, he decided to take off the bindings in his car, because he was sure even if he took his suspenders off, <br />
that he still would be seen as an androgynous looking man that he is, as he wore boxers beneath them.  <br />
<br />
He had a big, puffy chest, but it looked like a lovely pair of mantits on his olive oil body, as he was putting aloe on his strap-on cock and put a <br />
condom over his realistic looking dick inside his boxers.<br />
<br />
Inside the car, he took off his suit and removed the top portion of his suspenders, and took off his T-shirt, while rebuttoning the top of his <br />
suspenders.  From there, he looked at himself in the mirror.  <br />
<br />
Aroused at viewing himself as a strong, beautiful man with man tits, Sidney got himself off in the car, and started fingering his crotch inside his <br />
pants.  The only thing that would make him happier is if he had a real dick instead of a prosthetic one, but he was happy to go out on the night <br />
as a man prowling for some sex.<br />
<br />
From there, he wore a T-shirt over his suspenders, and wore his brown suit to hide any potential curves from viewing.  <br />
<br />
Looking at himself with a small mirror in his hand one last time, he saw himself as a blonde haired man with slicked back hair, with a dark <br />
brown goatee, while wearing a muscle white T-shirt, with his hairy cock bulging inside his black men’s pants, while wearing a brown blazer suit <br />
to tie it all off.  Pleased, he proceeded to zip up his pants, and decided to ring the doorbell of Jon, who was formerly Jenna. <br />
<br />
At Jon’s house, Jon answered the doobell.<br />
<br />
Twitching nervously, Jon said apprehensively, “Hi.  You must be Sidney, right?  I’m Cassie’s best friend, though she never talks about her <br />
brother.”<br />
<br />
Sidney replied coolly and reassuringly, “Sid.  And I’m her older brother.”<br />
<br />
Relieved, Jon replied, “Cool.  Come on in.” <br />
<br />
It was clear that Jon was heavily attracted to Sid, who looked a lot stronger and more masculine in his attire, despite Jon being a cisboy.  Jon <br />
took great interest into Cassie’s brother, and wanted to know more about who this man was.  Jon was greatly aroused at this man, and wanted <br />
to have him for himself.  <br />
<br />
(Little did he know however, that Sid is actually a pre-op transgendered FtM, who is transitioning from being Cassie to his new male identity <br />
and self.)<br />
<br />
The two boys sat on the couch..  Jon sat on the left side of the couch nervously, while Sid sat on the right.  Even though Jon was a cisman, Sid <br />
weighed more, was stronger, and had a sultry, masculine sort of swagger about him that was unlike any of the friends he befriended before <br />
(except when Jon was Jenna, and had dated ex-boyfriends who seemed to resemble a similar swagger and bravado as Sid’s).  <br />
<br />
Jon was certain that Sid was definitely not Cassie.  Cassie talked about boys all day, was kind of absorbed into her world, and seemed like a <br />
normal teenage girl and Jon’s best friend.  Sid resembled that of a cool, young cowboy, whose disposition with the world was like a Cool Hand <br />
Luke sort of attitude, and clearly seemed attracted ladies, and ladies alone (although Sid is also bi, and formerly Cassie).<br />
<br />
Sid broke the ice as he asked coolly, “So, what’s up?  You wanna go to a club?”<br />
<br />
Frantic and nervous, Jon wanted to suck his new friend off so badly and wanted to put his mouth on his penis, but at the last minute, he opted <br />
not to.  Jon wanted to kiss him so badly for being such a cool, tough new friend of his.<br />
<br />
Jon replied nervously, “Yeah, Sid.  Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
Sid replied, “Alright.  Let’s go pick up some ladies.”<br />
<br />
Jon burted out, “I love you Sidney and I want your balls.  Shit, I mean your body.  I mean your fucking dick.  And ass.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean <br />
to come on to you like that.  I’m just really nervous.”<br />
<br />
Sid looked at his friend, whose hands were wringing nervously from the blurted out statement he said before.<br />
<br />
Sid replied coolly, “Aw man, Jon, it’s cool.  We’re BFFs.  Wanna have some fun and hit the club?”<br />
<br />
Relieved, Jon replied with eagerness and anticipation, “Sure.  Let’s do it.”<br />
<br />
Jon was unsure what to make of Sid’s last statement, but failed to connect the dots as to what he meant.  All his mind was set on was to score <br />
on the masculine hunk he was hugging right next to him as they were going to go to a bar to hang out.  Jon was delighted that Sid already <br />
considered Jon a great friend and was willing to overlook his homosexual implications.   <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sid was looking to hang out with his dear friend Jon, and he wanted to have some fun with Jon at the club, so he can determine <br />
whether to hook up with a guy or girl, all while portraying himself as an uber masculine cisguy, and extremely hetero.<br />
<br />
As the two went to the car, Sid put his hand on Jon’s ass, as if to let him know that everything was okay.<br />
<br />
Sid said with husky nervousness, “Oh, my bad.  I didn’t know where my hand was.”<br />
<br />
Jon replied happily, “That’s okay Sid.  I didn’t mind.”<br />
<br />
The two boys went to Sid’s car, and proceeded to go to a bar that also had a DJ and a dance floor.</p>
