<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richard Van Direstag was still a bit uneasy over things when he got up, particularly in the odd dream that he&#39;d had. He was dedicated to his wife Rose and would never cheat on her with anyone, for any reason. To dream about being a were and having something of an orgy with Rose and another werelioness was something that frustrated him, though he chalked it up to things that he&#39;d overheard in the night before he fell asleep. That aside, he was still concerned about all the things that had made as a surprise on him that Moon Lake was a town full of weres and that one member of his family had to give up their humanity in order to stay there and protect this secret. It was something that was shocked and surprised him.<br />
<br />
It came off as something that would oppress his own right to be and Richard couldn&#39;t accept. Especially when he considered all the people that had taken part in the decision to hide things when he&#39;d looked into trying to find a place that would give Frank college he could afford. That sort of thing didn&#39;t meet reality and honesty. For the moment, his only hope was that the college might provide some kind of exemption for his family so that none of them would have to give up who they were, as it was Frank&#39;s college future that Richard had even brought his family to Moon Lake in the first place. He found Rose at the sink cleaning a few dishes from the morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rob and Rachel have already gone into school, dear,&quot; Rose spoke as Richard approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they stay safe,&quot; Richard commented with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure they are,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;they were fine when they came home from school yesterday. No one attacked them and no one did anything to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn&#39;t know about weres yesterday,&quot; Richard dismissed that, &quot;the didn&#39;t know that one of us has to give up our humanity just to live here. Now that they know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Supposedly Rachel&#39;s friend Melissa told Rachel, yesterday,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;and we agreed to learn first and judge later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And let them force us into a changing who we are?&quot; Richard answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m saying we take the time to learn, dear,&quot; Rose answered, &quot;maybe this change doesn&#39;t change who we are... just our form. You can&#39;t just jump to conclusions on the first day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that weren&#39;t an issue than the college could have explained that when I was talking with them regarding Frank&#39;s classes,&quot; Richard answered as he poured himself a cup of coffee, &quot;they could have explained more and been upfront about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rose finished with the dishes as she turned to see her husband selecting a box of cereal from the ones they had brought with them. He poured it and then made his way to the dining room, and Rose tentatively followed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose they could have,&quot; Rose admitted as she sat across from her husband, &quot;but there might well be a reason for it and one we don&#39;t know at present. That&#39;s why it might be better to learn some things first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I intend to do that with the college today,&quot; Richard answered, &quot;I&#39;ll need you and Frank to stay here and stay safe... make sure there is nothing wrong. Hopefully the city doesn&#39;t spring any more surprises.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The drive down to the college went a bit easier than the walk to the car repair shop did the previous morning, though mostly because Frank didn&#39;t go down through the center of town. That area was orderly with its electric stop lights, but because there were so many streets that made up Moon Lake&#39;s wagon wheel formation linking up there, it could take time to wait for each street to get its green light. In this it was faster to drive in a southerly direction that then curved more eastward after crossing Main Street and then turn right onto the street that would lead to Moon Lake College. He was amble to remember this after touring the town and the campus two summers earlier while Frank was still in the process of sending out applications.<br />
<br />
He arrived at the administration building and quietly parked in one of the visitor&#39;s spaces in front of the building. As he made his way toward the stone or brick building, Richard failed to note that the car he&#39;d parked next to also had Michigan plates. He simply kept his mind focused on his mission in trying to figure out where the college stood with regard to this whole &quot;Mandatory Were Law&quot; and all that likely went with it, along with some hope that they would have some form or waiver that could supersede the town&#39;s law, as he had done research into the college and while it was named for Moon Lake, the college didn&#39;t get any funding from the city, which meant it was privately funded. In this the college had to have an exception.<br />
<br />
He came up the front steps and then the front doors to note the main admissions desk sitting just inside the doors. There were a few other signs that pointed directions to other offices in the building, but it was the admissions staff that Richard was there to talk with. There was one lone woman presently at the desk and she looked up as he approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you, sir?&quot; the secretary spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;You represent the college&#39;s admissions department?&quot; Richard asked, &quot;I mean... with any degree of authority?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I work for the department, sir,&quot; the woman answered, &quot;though... if you... or a child had had issue with acceptance to the college, it is a bit late to be contesting anything related to that, sir. The fall semester started in August and we are now in November. You could always try again for next year...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, my son was admitted,&quot; Richard answered, barely hiding the frustration in his tone of voice which the secretary caught on to, &quot;what I&#39;m here for is where the college stands on this Mandatory Were Law non-sense...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a resident or new resident of Moon Lake, sir?&quot; the secretary asked with a thin frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... my son Frank was accepted here... but because of some financial complications that my family had, which I told the recruiter,&quot; Richard began, &quot;he couldn&#39;t have commuted between here and Michigan and we could only just afford to move to help him. The recruiter said the college had no problems with that and that since he did qualify for a scholarship, the college would work to help him. For the moment that&#39;s through some electronic coursework over the internet because we didn&#39;t know for sure when we&#39;d get here... Then we get here and your town government says we have to give up who we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are a resident IN Moon Lake, sir?&quot; the secretary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Richard practically growled in irritation, &quot;and I will tell you this town is the FIRST I&#39;ve ever come across where one&#39;s species is forfeit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normal humans and weres are all the same species, sir,&quot; the secretary answered, &quot;our science department and the city hospital have the DNA record comparisons to show that... and as for the Mandatory Were Law, that is a city ordinance that is designed for the protection of Moon Lake&#39;s population.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what? The middle ages?&quot; Richard answered, &quot;Look... I&#39;d be happy to sign a waiver that says my family wouldn&#39;t say anything or publicize anything related to weres being real. Your Town Chancellor didn&#39;t attack me, so I&#39;ll hold off any questions related to old myths... but this law is non-sense. That I, or someone in my family HAS to give up my humanity to satisfy some stupid law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, sir, the law is there for Moon Lake&#39;s protection,&quot; the secretary spoke, &quot;and is largely there to make sure that people moving too Moon Lake, who are far more likely to come across the town&#39;s were population fully understand the risks involved in maintaining that secret, for Moon Lake&#39;s protection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m saying I&#39;d gladly sign something that says I and my family wouldn&#39;t tell anyone,&quot; Richard cut the secretary off.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you or your sun lived outside of Moon Lake&#39;s city limits, that would be all that was needed,&quot; the secretary answered, &quot;as those outside Moon Lake... or those who are from out of state and residing in the dorms here on campus wouldn&#39;t be exposed to all aspects of were society and thus wouldn&#39;t have much they could actually reveal. But since you&#39;ve stated your family has moved to Moon Lake, that is a different issue. And the college cannot intervene or block city affairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re a private college... and the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT!&quot; Richard answered, &quot;You have to accommodate my wishes to protect my family!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, what we can accommodate you on would be in relation to your son&#39;s education and his college degree, which you&#39;ve likely agreed to pay,&quot; the secretary spoke trying to stay calm, though only just barely given the belligerency that Richard was taking and largely ignoring most of what she&#39;d said, &quot;I cannot... and the college cannot block or make exceptions for you or your family regarding city laws because you don&#39;t like them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;IT&#39;S NOT ABOUT LIKING THE LAW! IT&#39;S ABOUT PROTECTING MY FAMILY AND WHO WE ARE!&quot; Richard yelled back. He paused to collect himself and take a deep breath, though clearly frustrated by the fact that no one was seeming to understand that he meant no harm to Moon Lake&#39;s population and had no intent of hurting anyone in Moon Lake. He just wanted to see to it that his son got a college education and that his family was protected. &quot;I mean... if you moved here and suddenly had to give up who you are... would you just accept that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did move here, forty years ago,&quot; the secretary answered, &quot;and yes, the Mandatory Were Law is a surprise to people new to Moon Lake... but when the law was first written, the town&#39;s founders and elders had relatively recent memories of Europe&#39;s last were hunts. Where normal humans decided any were was in league with the devil and killed anyone accused, killing were and normal alike. Once the town was founded, there was the concern to prevent that from happening again... It was a surprise, to be sure... but aside from the ability to transform into an anthropomorphic animal, I don&#39;t think my personality... the core part of who I am... has changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s so... why not advertise it?&quot; Richard demanded, &quot;why keep things secret? Why?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The voice that answered that question wasn&#39;t the secretary but a male voice Richard only partially recognized. However, the voice also seemed to know him, which took him by surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been my experience, Mr. Van Direstag, that people will not always respond well to things they don&#39;t know at first and will want some assurances that the first response won&#39;t be to out Moon Lake or its people,&quot; the reply came, &quot;I know that because that&#39;s partially how I reacted to Moon Lake&#39;s Mandatory Were Law... but with time and learning... it can grow on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard turned to see two men standing near a flight of stairs that were just to the north side of the doors that Richard had come in through earlier. Both men were physically imposing with broad shoulders and an athletic and muscular build that couldn&#39;t really be hid all that well. One wore a suit and tie with the Moon Lake College insignia pinned to the lapel while the other was a red-headed male in a polo shirt and khakis. Richard didn&#39;t know the man in the suit, but he thought he&#39;d remembered the other man from somewhere... or at least the face from somewhere. It was the red haired man that introduced himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Harold Jenkins... I believe our daughters were friends back in Ann Arbor,&quot; Harold offered his hand, &quot;I know we&#39;ve never really met... but maybe I could help... and give the staff hear some time to recover from the shouting.&quot;</p>
