<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Didn't you say you were going over to Thomas's place,&quot; a voice asked and dragging my eyes away from my sister and forcing my mind to focus on the speaker, I saw my Aunt Jeannie standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
Nodding, I watched her walk toward the kitchen and looking back at Katherine, my mind torn, I mumbled, &quot;Maybe later,&quot; and getting up, I followed our Aunt.<br />
<br />
Inside the kitchen, I waited for Aunt Jeannie to finish fixing herself a bowl of cereal before I finally asked, &quot;It wasn't a dream, was it? I'm actually turning into a girl, my mom is now my sister, I used an amulet to save my best mate's life and at one time you really were a dog?&quot; and then added, &quot;As well as my mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aunt Jeannie took in all what I was saying, listening carefully and then, instead of answering my question, she asked, &quot;What exactly happened in the Hospital? And where is the amulet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting down at the table, I looked down, idly tracing the different grains on the table. After a moment, I looked up and then began to explain all that had taken place when I touched the amulet to Thomas and the dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the amulet crumbled away?&quot; Aunt Jeannie asked and then before I could reply, she inserted, &quot;Interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure, I looked back at the table and the asked, &quot;So what has all changed. Besides the house. Obviously Katherine still is thinking of me as her sister and I am betting my mother thinks of herself as my sister and I as her sister. But what about Thomas. I still call him Thomas, so he must still must male. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aunt Jeannie didn't say anything, instead continuing to eat her breakfast. After a moment, I asked, &quot;What happened to all the clothes that I had? The girl's clothes I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
A shrug from Aunt Jeannie and then she explained, &quot;Who knows. I think it would be really difficult to fully understand the full power of the amulet and what sway it has over the world when its magick is used.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at her, I asked, &quot;So will people see me as a girl or a boy? And what will happen if I dress in girl's clothes? Will that change anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another shrug from Aunt Jeannie and after a moment, I figured that this was something I was going to have to figure out on my own. Standing, I announced, &quot;I'm going over to Thomas's, if that's all right,&quot; and then, after a simple nod from Aunt Jeannie, I headed for the front door.<br />
<br />
Outside, I breathed in the cool summer air, and then paused as I realised that the season had skipped ahead. Shrugging, thinking, &quot;It had something to do with the amulet,&quot; I shrugged and made my way towards Thomas's place.<br />
<br />
It was shortly after I had rung the bell that I found out how weird things had gotten. When Thomas opened the door, I almost thought it was his sister, but then stopped. Taking in the soft skin and then now long red hair - just a bit shorter than mine, which hung midway down my back - I was unsure on how to breach the subject. And then, Thomas did exactly that by taking my hand and leading me in, he exclaimed, &quot;I have something to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, I said, &quot;I think I know what it is and I also have to tell you something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at me, a curious look on his face, he was about to ask something, but knowing what it was, I immediately told him, &quot;You go first. I can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, he looked around and then said, &quot;Let's go into the living room. My sister is out somewhere with my mother and I'm not sure I can trust my mind, which is going all weird, with being in my room or even near my sister's room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Knowing suddenly how he was feeling, I made a gesture that told him to lead the way and then followed after.<br />
<br />
Inside the living room, Thomas sat down on the floor, folding his legs and sitting in a posture I knew to be one familiar with how several girls I had seen sitting on the floor, Katherine included, usually sat. Not saying a word, I sat down next to him and after bit, Thomas explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night I had a weird dream. Or think it might have been last night. I'm not sure,&quot; he started. &quot;See, I think this has to do with that amulet you and I found a bit ago, but I am not sure how...&quot; and then he was explaining how he dreamed of being in the Hospital and how I had come to see him, twice, and how I had taken the amulet and did something with a dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don't know what,&quot; Thomas said as he finished his explanation. &quot;I just have a feeling it has to do with why I suddenly want to do some incredibly girly things. Like dress-up and play with my sister's dolls and watch the programmes I normally thought as girly, but now find interesting. And there is more than just that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I held up my hand to stop him and then looking at him, I told him, &quot;Hey. I know what you mean and I know what you're going through,&quot; and then, I slowly began to explain at that had happened to me after I found the Amulet of Zulo, leaving out Aunt Jeannie's story as I felt it might be a long stretch to explain that. And then, after I was done, I sat there, waiting for Thomas's reply, hoping he would believe me.</p>
