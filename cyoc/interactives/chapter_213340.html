<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The band was playing jazz they comprised of two black men on brass instruments, a white guy on piano and a portly black female singer. She had a strong voice. The tune was vaguely familiar to Matthew but she was not able to put a name to it. She noticed Lebron was tapping his feet to the tune. He really did look a cool dude. She took another sip.<br />
<br />
She noticed a group of three negro girls at a table. They were glancing at Lebron and smiling to each other, making comments that because of the music Matthew could not hear. She took another sip.<br />
<br />
She looked back at Lebron and caught him giving the black girls a wink. She watched as they discussed this latest development. Eventually one of the girls seemed to be delegated by the others to approach Lebron. She was a tall slim girl who Matthew guessed to be about 20. Her blue dress was clinging to her like a second skin.<br />
<br />
The girl looked quite nervous as she approached. Lebron just continued to tap his feet but his gaze was on the girl. Matthew took another sip of her drink only to discover the glass was empty. She placed the glass on the bar. The girl was now 6 feet away. <br />
<br />
Matthew had to put a stop to this. She couldn’t let the person who was really her 19 year-old sister be seduced by this girl. When the girl was only 3 feet away from Lebron she stepped between the two of them placed a hand on the girl’s stomach and said quite loudly so that the girl could hear over the music. ‘Sorry he’s with me’<br />
<br />
The girl seemed shocked by the intervention. She looked at Matthew with a look that could have been disgust. It seemed she didn’t like to be thwarted. Matthew gazed back at her with what she hoped was a determined look. They were eye to eye. Matthew’s hand remained on her stomach. <br />
<br />
Then Matthew felt a hand on her own stomach. It wasn’t the girls. It was a large strong hand reaching around her from behind. She noticed the girl’s eyes shift from her eyes to her stomach and then to the man standing behind her. <br />
<br />
The girl must have got some sort of signal from him. She gave Matthew one last angry glance then turned away and returned to her table. <br />
Matthew remained in front of Lebron to protect him from other groupies. Lebron’s hand remained on her stomach and gently pulled her back so that she could feel his body pressing into hers. She became aware that she could feel his leg tapping to the music.<br />
<br />
They remained like that until a change of song. Meanwhile Matthew noticed the three black girls leave the table each of them giving her an angry glance. They disappeared into the crowd. <br />
<br />
Lebron’s other hand reached in front of her with another drink. Matthew accepted it. A new song started and Lebron’s feet began to tap once more. This time his fingers began to tap on her stomach as well, keeping time with the tune. Matthew found herself swaying her hips to the rhythm of Lebron’s fingers.<br />
<br />
Matthew tasked herself with keeping all the females away from Lebron. He was a hunk and had plenty of admirers. She would stare back at any girl who dared look at him. She made sure they knew the he belonged to her. She was surprised to see her glass was empty once more but a large black hand took it from her and it was soon replaced by a full glass.<br />
<br />
About this time Matthew became aware of something particularly hard pushing against her butt. Lebron was holding her quite tight against his body. It was too big to be his wallet and did Lebron have a wallet anyway? She tried not to think about the fact that Lebron was really her little sister and just enjoyed the feelings running through her body.<br />
<br />
A hand took away her glass. Matthew was surprised to see it was empty but this time it was not replaced. Instead a deep sexy voice whispered in her ear ‘Since you won’t let me dance with anyone else how about we show dem how it’s done’<br />
<br />
Matthew found herself being led to the dance floor. She had already been rocking to the music and had the rhythm. She continued to sway her bum as they moved out to the floor. She revelled in the jealous looks of the other females knowing that she was the one dancing with the hunkiest man on the floor.<br />
<br />
Matthew found that in this body she was a good dancer. Christine had always been a competent dancer but Matthew usually had two left feet. She enjoyed being a good dancer and her confidence grew.<br />
<br />
When Lebron began to twirl her she squealed in delight. This was fun and he was so sexy. He gave her a very seductive smile.</p>
