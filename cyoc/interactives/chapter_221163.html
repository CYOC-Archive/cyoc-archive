<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hearing a voice addressing her, “Jess” looks up to see what appears to be a 16 year-old Hispanic boy, if she would have been the original “Jess”, she would have recognized the boy as Rick, but since Jess kept her relationship with Rick a secret from her family, the boy never visited Jeff’s home, this causes Jeff/”Jess” to be unaware who this boy is, “do I know you,” the “girl” asks.<br />
<br />
Rick, now Miguel, grins inwardly, ‘seems as though she doesn’t recognize me. Sweet,’ he thinks to himself, “no, my name is Miguel,” the boy says, “I just noticed you struggling with those bags and decided to ask if you could use a hand,” he adds, putting on a friendly smile.<br />
<br />
“Jess”, for some reason, gets a strange feeling about the boy, ‘something tells me I should not trust this guy,’ she thinks to herself, ‘but I could use a helping hand, he does seem kind, but I’ll keep a close eye on him anyway.’ The “girl” then smiles, “that would be kind of you,” she says, “I bought more than I intended,” she then says with a giggle. “My name is Jess, it is nice to meet you, Miguel,” the “girl” then says, as Miguel grabs a few bags from her, ‘he actually is pretty handsome,’ “Jess” suddenly thinks to herself, ‘luckily I made myself a lesbian, still… I can’t ignore that he is one handsome boy.’<br />
<br />
“Did you come with a car,” Miguel asks, as they start to walk, heading towards the exit.<br />
<br />
“No, I came on foot,” the “girl” replies, “it’s only a 30 minute walk to my house,” she then looks at the boy, “are you from around here? I don’t think I ever seen you around before.”<br />
<br />
Miguel is surprised, ‘man, she REALLY does not recognize me,’ he thinks to himself, ‘this is so perfect,’ he then smiles, “yeah, I live about an hour away, near the beach on the other side of town,” he then says.<br />
<br />
“I see,” the “girl” says, they continue to walk in silence for a while, “Jess” senses that Miguel glances over at her from time to time, “are you checking me out,” she bluntly asks.<br />
<br />
Miguel actually blushes, “s-sorry,” he says, “I… I can’t help it when I see a hot girl. Sorry for being so direct, b-but at least I am honest… right?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” can’t help but chuckle, “all good,” she says, “I don’t blame you, I do have a sexy figure. Besides, you are not the only boy who checks me out, before you ask: yes, I am single… BUT before you even think of asking: I’m a lesbian!”<br />
<br />
Miguel is noticably shocked, “oh…,” he says, sounding disappointed, ‘I always thought it was weird that she never wanted to have sex with me, now I know why! I better fix that,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be sad,” “Jess” says, “I am sure you’ll find a girlfriend who might even be hotter than me,” she adds jokingly.<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” Miguel says, ‘YOU are the girl I want, Jess! And nothing and no one will stand in my way,’ he thinks to himself. The boy takes out his phone and opens the App, “excuse me, I need to send my mom a message that I’ll be a little late,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Okay, no problem,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
Miguel opens “Jess’s” file, since his Chronivac-App is not linked to Jeff’s, the App, when Miguel scanned the “girl”, accidentally assumed that Jeff is the original “Jess”, so instead of the App displaying Jeff’s details and transformation history, it displays the details of the real “Jess”, except for the “sexual orientation”. The real “Jess” is of course a straight girl, but Jeff, not wanting to fall in love with a boy, changed it to lesbian.<br />
<br />
The file on Miguel’s App shows the following:<br />
<br />
Name: Jess Davis<br />
Age: 16<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Gender: female<br />
Cup-size: 36C<br />
Hair length, colour and style: long, black, pony tail<br />
Eye colour: brown<br />
Sexual orientation: lesbian<br />
Attracted to: Athletic girls<br />
Fertile: yes<br />
Hymn: broken, due to exercise<br />
Relationship status: single<br />
Wearing: black lace panties, black lace bra, blue skinny jeans, pink t-shirt<br />
Awareness: off<br />
<br />
Miguel then starts to type:<br />
<br />
Name: Jess Davis<br />
Age: 16<br />

Gender: female<br />
Cup-size: 36C<br />

Eye colour: brown<br />

Attracted to: Athletic boys, especially Hispanic boys<br />
Relationship status: single<br />
Fertile: yes<br />

Wearing: black lace panties, black lace bra, blue skinny jeans, pink t-shirt<br />
Awareness: off<br />
Time of change/transformation: instant<br />
Duration of change/transformation: permanent<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Miguel confirms the change and puts his phone away, ‘now, all I have to do is wait,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
As “Jess” walks, unaware of what Miguel is doing, she is lost in thought, ‘being a girl is real fun,’ she thinks to herself, she glances over at the boy walking beside her, ‘Miguel really is handsome. He as an amazing athletic body, he is the kind of boy I am interested in. I am surprised that he is single, I should take the chance and ask him out… WAIT! WHAT AM I THINKING?!’<br />
<br />
The “girl’s” eyes widen in shock when she realizes what she is thinking, ‘I shouldn’t be thinking this kind of stuff,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I set my orientation to be lesbian, so why am I all of a sudden interested in Miguel? Did something go wrong?’<br />
<br />
Miguel notices “Jess’s” surprise and grins inwardly, “Jess, you okay?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” blinks, “y-yeah… I’m fine,” she says, she looks at Miguel, ‘he is so handsome,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I really would like to get to know him better… NO! NO NO NO! I AM NOT GAY!’<br />
<br />
“You don’t seem fine to me,” Miguel says, sounding genuinely concerned.<br />
<br />
“I… it’s just the heat getting to me,” the “girl” says.<br />
<br />
“Do you need a rest,” Miguel asks.<br />
<br />
“Jess” nods, “y-yeah… and a drink of water would help,” she says.<br />
<br />
Miguel nods, “okay, let’s find some shade and I’ll get you some water,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Jess” simply nods, so the two make a B-line towards the park, they soon find a nice shady area beneath a big tree. The “girl” sits down and lets out a sigh, “I… I really should be more careful,” she mumbles.<br />
<br />
Miguel puts the bags down, “wait here,” he says, “I’ll go and get us some water,” with that he hurries off.<br />
<br />
“Jess” watches him, ‘Miguel is so kind and caring,’ she thinks to herself, ‘just like a boyfriend should be… GAAAH! STOP THINKING LIKE THAT! WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON! GET A GRIP, JEFF!’<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Miguel returns and sees the “girl” still sitting under the tree, her head in her hands, seeming to be in distress. “Whoa, Jess,” the boy says as he approaches her, “take it easy. Here have some water,” he then hands her a bottle of water.<br />
<br />
“Jess” takes the bottle, “thanks, Miguel,” she then takes a big gulp, “aaaah… so good,” she says, she then notices Miguel sitting down next to here, this causes “Jess” to feel a little uneasy, ‘wh-why does he have to sit so close?’<br />
<br />
Miguel himself is fighting the urge of just giving the girl next to him a kiss, ‘it’s so hard,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but I should hold back, I don’t want to lose her again!’<br />
<br />
As the minutes tick by, none of them talk, “Jess” starts to relax, ‘I can sense that he’d like to kiss me,’ she thinks to herself, ‘a part of me really would want that, but the other part of me is disgusted by the thought of kissing a boy! But… would it really be that bad? I mean… it is just a kiss… it… it’s not like we are having sex,’ the “girl” feels so torn, unsure what to do.<br />
<br />
Then Miguel speaks up, “Jess,” he asks, the “girl” looks over at the boy, “I… I think you are really pretty… I… I’d like to give you a kiss… w-would that be okay?”<br />
<br />
“Jess” is stunned, ‘I knew he’d ask sooner or later,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I… I’d love for him to kiss me… but then again I don’t… I feel so conflicted… what shall I do?!’</p>
