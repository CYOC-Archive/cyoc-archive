<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I think it&#39;d be good to keep track if a couple of things.<br/>
Current day: Tuesday, 1st week<br/>
Upcoming events: -Wednesday, tell Margo during lunch if  Rhonda joins her <br/>
-Friday, Date with May</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rhonda was arguing back and forth internally, but ultimately she knew she was only delaying the inevitable. Of course she would help her best friend no matter the risk, they’d been helping each other since pre-school and she surely wouldn&#39;t stop doing so now. “Alright, let&#39;s try it for today. Luckily we share our remaining classes today. Tomorrow you’ll either have to find someone else or find a better way to move.” <br />
<br />
Sofia looked slightly pensive herself before determinedly nodding her head. “Let&#39;s do it.”<br />
<br />
The three made their way to the nearest bathroom. After the two entered an empty stall, Sofia just let her uniform fall through her body to the ground to not waste anymore time. <i>Of course, she didn&#39;t bother forming any naughty bits, </i> Rhonda couldn&#39;t help but think. <i> But…</i> “Did you make your breasts bigger?” the latina smirked.<br />
<br />
“What? N-N-No!” Sofia stuttered. Rhonda was certain it wasn&#39;t because of her vocal chords this time.<br />
<br />
Not really knowing how to start the two transformed teens just hugged each other. Sofia started oozing over Rhonda&#39;s arms, covering her scales and rapidly advancing to her skin covered chest. Slowly and somewhat awkwardly she slithered under Rhonda’s uniform, which thankfully was among many other enchantments water repellant. The latina had to stifle a gasp when her friend started to cover her chest, her nipples standing at attention because of the unexpected teasing. It made her dread, but also a bit excited, at how far Sofia would actually go with this. Finally she felt something round and slightly denser, probably Sofia&#39;s core, nestle between her breasts. <br />
<br />
Next the slime went upwards, aiming for Rhonda&#39;s head as well as her wings. As she went over Rhonda&#39;s face a thin membrane formed over it. In spite of it, the latina found she could still see, breath and hear unimpeded. The slime finished her upper half by also covering her hair, giving the red mane a purplish shine in the right light.<br />
<br />
Then came Rhonda&#39;s lower half. The tail didn&#39;t prove to be much of a problem, but that was when Sofia started flowing over her crotch area. As the slime started to form its membrane over her vagina, Rhonda felt her own arousal rising. Not helping was Sofia&#39;s slime swirling around her most sensitive spots apparently intentionally edging her on. The latina couldn&#39;t stop some moans escaping as her quickly covered knees slowly buckled. Rhonda reached her breaking point and came, though no fluids escaped, as all were directly absorbed by the slime. <br />
<br />
Kneeling on the tiled floor Rhonda needed a few moments to catch her breath. They did practice kissing a few times at home (mostly on Rhonda&#39;s insistence), but that was nothing compared to this. “W-What… was that… Sofia?” she panted. <br />
<br />
“Just a small... th-thank you for putting up... with all of this.” Rhonda flinched, not expecting an answer. Especially when it seemed to come right from her own ear. “And did you really th-th-think your best friend wouldn&#39;t notice how… tense you’ve been the last two days.”<br />
<br />
The latina smirked. “Didn&#39;t think you had it in you. Usually you are the hardass during our adventures.”<br />
<br />
“Th-There&#39;s a t-time and p-p-place for everything.” Rhonda was certain that Sofia would&#39;ve been blushing if she was human. &quot;A-And if anything... it was just ass-ass-assssisted mast-t-turbation. I didn&#39;t ac-actually enter you.&quot; <br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
In another classroom Margo Keischo stopped her note taking for a moment. <i>I feel like I just missed something great…</i><br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
They left the stall and were greeted by a practically red glowing Lichi. “A-A-A-A-Are you alright?”<br />
<br />
“Suuuuure, Sofia just… uhhh… had some trouble controlling her body…” Rhonda awkwardly replied. “Sooo, how do we look?” <br />
<br />
Lichi went with Rhonda&#39;s blatant attempt at changing the topic. “You look awesome, like a true heir to the demon throne.”<br />
<br />
Assuming that as a compliment Rhonda still took a look into a mirror herself. She didn&#39;t look that much different. Aside from the shine her whole body seemed to have now, the slime cover was barely noticeable over her black scales. Her normal skin however appeared purple now thanks to Sofia. Being covered in slime felt… weird to Rhonda. She could feel the wet membrane covering her body, but also everything outside of it as if it wasn&#39;t there at all. There was also this comfortable warmth she usually feels when the two ended up merged in some way. <br />
<br />
“And is Sofia alright?” Lichi asked.<br />
<br />
Just when Rhonda wanted to answer, she felt the slime around her midsection shift. Lifting her shirt she saw the slime membrane over her stomach slowly form into a copy of Sofia’s face, which only took a few seconds longer to speak up. “I’m okay. This is a… surprisingly good training for shape ch-changing and fine motor skills.” Rhonda couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit jealous at her talented friend. When she got turned into a slime it took her two hours just to turn a doorknob.<br />
<br />
Now it was Lichi’s eyes that were glowing. “You two are the coolest friends I ever had.”<br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
When they finally reached the classroom their teacher’s only concern was their prolonged absence, but thankfully they had the permission slips from the principal. The remaining lesson proceeded fairly normally (for a witch school at least). With her draconic hearing Rhonda did pick up quite a few whispers from the other students, most of those about them. It made her wonder if these only started because of Sofia’s transformation or if they’ve always been there and she only noticed now, because Miss Hexe pointed it out to her. She tried to ignore them and instead to focus on the lesson and her bond with her best friend. While there was still some dread regarding potential tricks by the Countess, like with her dragon body she found herself not minding this odd configuration much. <br />
<br />
This continued into their next classes. The teachers didn&#39;t bat an eye at the slime-dragon-symbiosis (making Rhonda wonder what they’d already experienced in previous years) while the whispers seemed to be getting louder. At least their friends were actually concerned for Sofia. May had to be talked out of taking samples of her for testing, while Amelia just commented how despite having tails coming out of her head she wasn&#39;t the center of attention. The latina was curious how her supposed sister would react to this, but with Sofia following her every step she had no way to contact her without getting even more attention.<br />
<br />
It reached its peak during lunch when Abigail placed a bowl of jelly before Rhonda. “Sofia&#39;s little sister here told me she wanted to join you. Would you please do her a favor and rub her over your chest?” She walked away while cackling loudly.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Sof, you think you could reinforce my claws and make them Wolverine-like?” Rhonda grumbled out.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t, she&#39;s not worth it.” Sofia&#39;s speech was improving quickly. “And you got free jelly, so her joke backfired.”<br />
<br />
Rhonda hoped it was a failed prank as the alternative was the jelly being another weird way of Abigail making advances on her. “No thanks.” She pushed it over to Usami, who gladly ate it.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day passed uneventful, the girls deciding to not do much to not stress Sofia&#39;s body too much. Still they played around with Sofia&#39;s new form a bit, having her slime turn into various forms like additional spikes, a sword arm, she even managed a mermaid tail. Over the afternoon Rhonda came to realize that she actually started to enjoy their symbiosis. She feared this school might actually turn her into a transformation enthusiast. Soon enough it became time to go to bed. <br />
<br />
“I guess it&#39;s time to separate again,” Sofia said to her friend.<br />
<br />
Rhonda couldn&#39;t believe what she was about to say next. “I know I said just for today, but could we maybe stay together a bit longer? Only for tonight, see it like a sleepover…”<br />
<br />
Sofia sighed. “Alright, you’re lucky I enjoy not having to move on my own. As long as our friends have no problem with it.”<br />
<br />
And thankfully they didn&#39;t (they didn&#39;t bother asking Abigail). Though Rhonda noticed May reacting a bit weird. Despite that she even supplied them with plastic sheets for Rhonda&#39;s bed. And thus the red-haired dragon girl covered head-to-toe in her slime friend went to sleep to finish her second day at St. Chariot’s, potential issues regarding Sofia&#39;s transformation forgotten for the moment.</p>
