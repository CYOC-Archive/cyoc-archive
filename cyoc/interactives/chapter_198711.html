<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After having good enough confirmation that this power is real, you simply decide to leave. Why be in school if you are allowed to leave whenever you want? Why be around people that you don&#39;t particularly like if you don&#39;t need to? So you simply got up and left the classroom. On the way out the teacher gives you a glance and nothing more, simply acknowledging that you&#39;re leaving and nothing more. You then proceed to walk your way home to give yourself time to think. What to do first? Anything is possible theoretically. Maybe go steal some money since you&#39;re allowed to now? Though you suppose that it might not really be considered stealing if they would allow you to take it with no protest. That&#39;s basically just giving money to you at that point. You wouldn&#39;t even need to threaten force. Just walk in, open the register, grab money, walk out. You decide against doing this, as aside from it being unnecessary (you have plenty of money as is) it would also be pretty shitty to do since you would have no intention of returning it, and they couldn&#39;t stop you. Perhaps later you&#39;ll reconsider, but for now it&#39;s just not worth doing. Perhaps you could help people instead? It would be quite easy. If somebody was ever being dangerous, such as threatening to shoot somebody, you could just walk up and grab the gun out of their hands, and they wouldn&#39;t even stop you. They would just let it happen, because you&#39;re allowed to. As fun as that sounds, basically being a superhero, it probably wouldn&#39;t end up actually helping all that many people, and most of the time it would probably be quite boring with not much to do. Besides, it&#39;s not like you&#39;ve ever been much of the upstanding citizen type. No, if you&#39;re going to use this power it will probably be for selfish reasons most of the time, if not always. It&#39;s not a very visually glamorous power, but it&#39;s certainly ripe for abuse in everyday life.<br />
<br />
Just as you&#39;re finishing this thought, you come up to your houses driveway. Your Moms black SUV is parked in the driveway, as well as your older sisters small, old, red Prius. Your dads car was gone, probably cause he&#39;s still at work. You don&#39;t have a car, as you don&#39;t have enough money to afford one, and the Prius was given to your sister. It now occurs to you that your choice to walk home also left behind your bike at school. However you also quickly come to the conclusion that it doesn&#39;t matter much, because you can just go get a new one for free. You walk up the driveway and head inside. <br />
<br />
Inside you find your little sister Rachel playing with toys on the living room floor. She&#39;s only 8, making her the youngest in the family. She has long black hair and green eyes, both of which came from your Mom, and is wearing clothes pretty typical of an 8 year old girl, with a pink shirt, jeans, and light up sketchers. You actually like Rachel. She&#39;s the only one of your 3 siblings who don&#39;t annoy you, though given time and a little growing up, you&#39;re sure she will. You walk into the kitchen to grab a snack and find your younger brother Caleb eating soup. For some reason school was cancelled for him and Rachel today, so they&#39;re home all day. You are now too you suppose. Caleb is 12, with light brown hair that he got from your Dad, and is wearing an Iron Man sweater, jeans, and cheap Converse shoes. Caleb does annoy you, though you recognize that it&#39;s not really his fault, as he&#39;s just very enthusiastic about his interests, which you mostly don&#39;t share. Your older sister Kate also walks into the room behind you. She&#39;s your only older sibling, at 19, as opposed to your 18. Despite having barely graduated high school, she tends to laud any perceived intelligence over you, despite likely being around the same level. She hasn&#39;t bothered to apply herself at all past graduating, and has spent most of the last year lounging around the house, pretending to look for a job. She has zero plans for college, and you&#39;re confident that she isn&#39;t really going anywhere in life, though somehow your parents are oblivious to this fact. Your parents have always treated her better than you, just because she&#39;s older. She got a free car before she even had her permit, and she never uses the thing, but also never lets you use it either. If she weren&#39;t your sister, you&#39;re confident that you would absolutely despise her, but because she is it&#39;s kept at a low hate level usually. You&#39;re also confident that if she weren&#39;t your sister you&#39;d have absolutely tried to hit on her by now, or at least failed trying. Aside from your parents preference towards her, her looks are about the only thing that she has going for herself. She&#39;s around 5 feet tall, though you don&#39;t know exactly, which puts her at least a full head below you. She has a bit of a mix between your Mom and Dad&#39;s genes, with light brown hair, and green eyes, and roughly the same height and chest size as your Mom. <br />
<br />
After thinking about all this, you&#39;re snapped back to reality remembering how annoying Kate is. With your new power you decide to annoy her back, and she can&#39;t do anything about it. You walk up and flick her on the nose. Not much, but effective to annoy. She starts rubbing her nose afterwards, and glares at you. &quot;What the hell was that for?&quot; she says. Instead of responding you simply pull her hand back and flick it again. &quot;OW! Stop it you dick!&quot; she says, clearly becoming immediately annoyed. <br />
&quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot; you ask, challenging her directly.<br />
&quot;Ok fine, I get it. I can&#39;t do anything about it. Doesn&#39;t mean that you have to be such an asshole.&quot; she says. She, much like your classmate and teacher earlier, has simply accepted that you can do whatever you want, as if that was the most normal thing ever. In retaliation for calling you an asshole you flick her on the nose again. &quot;OW! You know what? Just because you can do whatever you want, doesn&#39;t mean that I have to stand here and take it. So unless you want to restrain me, I&#39;m going to my room.&quot; She says, before storming off. Impulsively you decide to slap her on the butt as she was walking away. You&#39;re not entirely sure why you did it, but it was a hard enough slap that it still clearly annoyed her more. Aside from annoyance however she doesn&#39;t seem to pay the gesture much attention. You here her storm off up the stairs and into her room, before you hear the door lock. You figure that was sufficient annoyance for now. A few seconds later your Mom comes in after hearing the noise.<br />
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; she asks you. <br />
&quot;Kate was just being a bitch again.&quot; you say, expecting some sort of negative reaction from your Mom, since she&#39;s usually pretty strict about not talking like that about each other. <br />
&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t talk about your sister like that.&quot; Wow. That was framed more like advice than the usual admonishment. She still clearly cares that you shouldn&#39;t use that language, she just can&#39;t stop, and doesn&#39;t really make an effort to.<br />
Looking at your Mom, it&#39;s clear where Kate got most of her good looks from. Your Mom sits at around 5 feet 4 inches, putting her a solid few inches above Kate. She&#39;s probably the smartest member of your family, and she works from home. She has black hair and green eyes. Your Mom is usually very kind to you, though can be stern and a bit loud when you do something she doesn&#39;t like. Though that isn&#39;t likely to happen much anymore. Whenever Kate is around however she always seems to prioritize her over everyone else in the room. Your Mom is wearing a loose fitting shirt, and pajama pants, as well as pink slippers. Her decently long hair is put into a bun. Your Mom works from home, and so doesn&#39;t need to look very presentable most of the time. Even through her loose fitting shirt you can still pretty clearly see that she isn&#39;t wearing a bra. Unfortunately for her children, she does that fairly often. You can&#39;t tell if she thinks nobody notices, or if she just doesn&#39;t care. Nobody has ever really had the guts to bring it up to find out. However with your new power you felt that you could now bring it up without fear of consequence.<br />
&quot;Are you not wearing a bra right now?&quot; you ask, very bluntly. Your Mom blushes slightly, though you&#39;re not sure at first if out of embarrassment or anger. She takes a second before answering.<br />
&quot;No. No I&#39;m not. Why should I? My house after all. Sorry if that inconveniences you.&quot; She says that last bit, clearly a bit ticked that you would even bring it up. Still fearing no punishment you continue.<br />
&quot;You should go put one on. I think we all find it a little weird. It&#39;s Dad&#39;s house too, but you don&#39;t see him walking around with no underwear.&quot; You aren&#39;t looking at her when you said all that, currently looking through the cabinets to find something to eat. You&#39;re expecting her to perhaps get a bit more angry at your further pushing of the subject, but she seems to actually drop it altogether once you&#39;ve turned around. But then you notice something different. Her chest doesn&#39;t look the same as before. Now it actually did look like she was wearing a bra. &quot;Wait, did you really put one on?&quot; you ask, confused how she could have done that in the time it took you to look through the cabinet.<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? Put one what on?&quot; she asks visibly confused.<br />
&quot;A bra. You weren&#39;t wearing one a few seconds ago.&quot; you say, confused how she couldn&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.<br />
&quot;Of course I&#39;m wearing one now. You told me to.&quot; she says, now blushing again. You&#39;re confused now too. She put one on that fast? And just because you told her to? Did you convince her to, or did she do it because you told her to? And why would she listen. Being allowed to do anything doesn&#39;t mean that others have to listen to you, does it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mom. Do a jumping jack.&quot; you say, testing your theory. Immediately she springs into action and begins doing a single jumping jack. Thankfully she was now wearing a bra or that could have looked much worse for her. So it does seem like she has to obey. &quot;Why are you listening to me?&quot; you ask, hopefully to get some answers about how this all works now.<br />
&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I? Everyone does.&quot;<br />
&quot;Everyone?&quot; you ask, just to make sure she&#39;s not exaggerating.<br />
&quot;Pretty sure yeah. I don&#39;t know why anybody wouldn&#39;t. We all listen to you.&quot; she says, as if it&#39;s incredibly normal.<br />
&quot;Hey Caleb. Sneeze.&quot; You say to Caleb, who is now cleaning up his dishes after finishing eating. You say this as a test to see if you can get somebody to do something that would normally be difficult for them to force. Immediately after finishing the command, Caleb sneezes directly into the bowl he&#39;s cleaning. He continues cleaning as if nothing happened. They really listen to everything you say. You think of another test of this newer part of your power. Can they obey commands they don&#39;t hear? You whisper under your breath, quiet enough that Caleb definitely doesn&#39;t hear you, or at least he wouldn&#39;t be able to make out the words. &quot;Hey Caleb. Sneeze again.&quot; Immediately after you say it Caleb sneezes again. That&#39;s so cool. You whisper something again. &quot;Hey Kate. Come out here.&quot; There&#39;s no way she heard that from up in her room, nor did you want her to. But surely enough you hear her door unlock, and she grumpily stomps down the stairs and into the kitchen. &quot;Why did you come back down?&quot; you ask, curious if she knew you called her. <br />
&quot;I just did, okay? Is that a good enough reason for you?&quot; She says, still clearly annoyed with you from earlier. Interesting. So when you don&#39;t want them to realize they&#39;ve been commanded, they don&#39;t seem to know why they&#39;re doing something, or at least they come up with a reason in their head to justify it, but they still follow through with the command. So intent does matter. You then think of two more tests that you can do in one command.<br />
&quot;Turn your hair blonde.&quot; you say, loudly enough for her to hear you, but with the intent of having her not know you commanded her. In a blink her hair has instantly turned bright blonde instead of her natural brown. You weren&#39;t sure whether her hair would change instantly, or whether she would go get it dyed. Turns out it was the former.<br />
&quot;Hey Kate, why is your hair blonde?&quot; you ask to confirm if your intention of her not knowing about the command had worked.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, it just is. Weird genetics I guess. Why are you asking all these weird questions?&quot; So not only had her hair turned blonde, but that command had somehow added a recessive blonde gene into your family which expressed itself only in Kate. You walk into the hallway to find the family picture has changed as well, to reflect Kates new blonde status. The kicker is this picture was taken 4 years ago. So Kate really has always had blonde hair now. This power is truly amazing. You begin to think of what else you could do with this combination of abilities.</p>
