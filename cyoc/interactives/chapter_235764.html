<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike, turned over slightly, the soft sheets barely touching his sensitive canine manhood <br />
Mike let out a small whimper As mini shots of precum began to spurt from his highly aroused canine member. Mike kicked at the sheets. <br />
Derick was stirred awake by a knocking at the door, it was Derricks step-sister Mel. <br />
The knocking was loud and urgent, it shook Derick awake but Mike was sound asleep, still hard as a rock, and enjoying his dream.<br />
Mel came in and in an almost cringey way said “have you seen what’s been happening!??” The news, everyone is turning into Dogs!! She is Pale and stricken with shock so Derrick grabs her with concern but actually spreads the virus to her by doing this. He said don’t panic, we will find out the best thing to do. I’m already hit, I’m changing, but it dosent hurt! <br />
Slowly gathering herself and slowing her breath, she says “ I guess we will just have to let it be what it is, softly cries,” there is really nothing we can do unless science somehow saves us! <br />
They both were disturbed by what sounded like a puppy whining in the next room.<br />
Mike had changed more…<br />
Black fur crept up his legs and underarms. His toenails were now sharp and pointed. He had a somewhat upturned face, and the hair in his cheeks were now completely covered, his canine dick still spurting pre every few seconds onto his furry chest leaving a wet puddle that had dripped down either side to slightly wet the bed. Derick and Mel hurriedly opened the door, and exclaimed in unison shock, “what the” as Mikes cock jutted further out of its sheath and a giant strand of milky white thick semen shot out. (It must’ve been some of the last of the human cum that remained in him) while Mike moans almost like a doggy’s whimper. What do we do? Asked Derrick?!? Mel responded shakily: “ wake him up?” , “does that stop a Wet dream?? It was far too late, mikes doggy cock had extended even further and was bobbing up and down with every pulse that shot out a thick stream of cum, if there was any human cum left it’s all gone now. Along with some of the last of his human featured were retreating, His sheath was tight around his knot, but his knot was swollen and still inside it, causing both great discomfort and great pleasure for the Doberman. Still asleep he kicked the bed again with frustration, while simultaneously shooting a thick stream of cum extremely high and actually hitting Mel on the lips! She screamed in terror wiping it away not knowing from her step brother and the scene she was witnessing she was already sprouting a small tail, and pointed ears, to which when Derick pointed it out to her, her fear quietly subsided. Mike kicked at the bed again hard slightly showering the room, attempting to kick his knot free. Derick said enough of this and quickly grabbed his friend and did his best to shake him awake. Mike moaned and shot his canine seed onto Derick’s bare chest, Derick accidentally moaned, and after he gathered himself he did best to sit Mike upright, and Jostle him awake. Mikes doggy cock was hanging from its sheath now pouring doggy liquids onto the hardwood every few seconds. Mike was acting drunk, he finally snapped awake right as Derick figured he could pull back mikes sheath more so at least he wasn’t in pain. Derick was able to watch for mere seconds as the light retured to Mikes eyes, and then promptly faded into a dogs gaze as the full load of puppy seed shot out of him at almost pressure washer speed. At least more than a quart of not half a gallon of doggy seed shot onto the floor. Coating Derick who had just been kneeling in front of him. Derick gets up and says,” it’s ok Mel” I won’t fully change if none of us have sex, right? Wiping cum off of him with his bare hands, with sone getting caught in the fur on the backs of them. I have a cage, I will put Mike in there and I think you and me being practically brother and sister should be able to handle ourselves just fine! And if either of us feel uncomfortable we will leave, ok? Mel says is it ok if I tell my cousin Tim he can come too, he’s been trying to find a place to be safe at all day, and I really would feel more comfortable with someone else here to keep things from going awry, no distrust of you.  I totally understand said Derrick trying to get his mind off of the arousing smell of the fluids in the room and even the feminine intimate scents of his step sister he was now able to faintly pick up. “We are not ourselves”<br />
He whispered not loud enough for her to hear. He quickly runs to put Mike in the cage who was promptly licking on his canine penis to clean it off and get it to shrink. As he stood up it slipped back into its pouch. And Derrick placed a padlock on the black cage and threw the key out the window. Well shit! I should’ve thought!, I have to feed and water him too! I can’t just, fuck. <br />
Mel says “I’ll get it while I wait for Tim” no worries, “I don’t want you to somehow fully change before I come back and we can find a way to fix this, she laughed out loud!” <br />
It’s not really a funny predicament, thought Derek. But at least it didn’t hurt. As she left, Derek felt a deep familiar feeling in his loins. A feeling so familiar, yet, so so much stronger. It made him salivate, It made it feel like parts of his body went numb, but it also gave him more excitement than anything. Derek was terrified of this feeling, he didn’t feel in control. But that somehow made it even hotter! His canine cock pressing as his waistband from the sweats he put on to answer the door felt soo good he whined and writhed until he caught himself, and watched in horror as more dark orange fur covered his arms with a pleasure like feeling. “Fuck no, I have to stop, what’s into me” Derek said he shook his head and took a short cold shower, Mel arrives back with her cousin Tim, and yells “hey where are you” he just relies back with “in the shower” shakily, is everything ok she asks, he says absolutely!  I’ll be out in a sec. As Derek turns the ice cold water off, his doggy tip was still poking out of its sheath, damn it! What will I do with you! He laughs and dosent consider it too serious. He does not realize how long he has tried to hold back his transformation his dog body is aching to get back ground. He dried off, puts back on his clothes and meets the others in the living room. Mike is barking wanting to be let out of the cage and Mel in taunting him laughing with the key and places it in her bra, Derek feels he can smell Tim’s crotch from where he’s at standing, same with Mel, even with the fur starting to creep in on his cheeks, you can tell he’s blushing! And He starts to have a small nosebleed, as he tries to resist these new urges. Along with a growing bulging sensation in his groin, More powerful than earlier, To the point where it felt even more than he was just going to come right then and there without any stimulus. He doubles over takes a few short breaths. Tim tries to hide the fact he can tell Derek is turned on, by putting his weight above his growing boner, <br />
“So strange, he thought, I’ve never been gay. Not realizing Mel had infected him. “maybe I am more than I thought I was” I need to look into that he laughed to himself. Little did he know Derek could smell his arousal and it was building and building too much for him. He goes to the kitchen and grabs a large glass of water and downs it within seconds. He looks over noticing Mel has grown a good half-tail, it looked like a full tail, but was only half size. She was wagging joking around with Tim in the couch, he could notice he can smell her arousal building, and wonders how long it’ll take her to crumble the false sense of control, like he did. Or if she would be able to fight it off… heat builds once again in Derek’s crotch, a minded numbing heat… he bends down again and shakes his head hard, his canine dick pulsated hard, forced to stay in its sheath by the fabric above it. He winces and cries out, it truly feels like he’s about to cum!</p>
