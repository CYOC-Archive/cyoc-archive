<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I dunno how to italicise in this editor, sorry.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You grin, leaning against the wall. &quot;I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t throw yourself at every girl you see,&quot; you say, holding up the Veil. &quot;After all, *you&#39;ve been a huge lesbian since forever, right?*&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily shivered, as the decor in her room changed. Her bookshelf filled itself with Yuri porn mags, and posters of scantly clad women appeared on the wall. The strongly built, handsome man on her computer screen becomes a handsome woman, titties out for all to see. &quot;I-I&#39;m not that bad!&quot; she replied, biting her bottom lip. <br />
<br />
You raise an eyebrow. &quot;Emily. *You shiver whenever a girl so much as looks at you*,&quot; you point out, the Veil making it so. &quot;*You&#39;re such a shameless lesbian, it&#39;s embarrassing.*&quot; <br />
<br />
Your sister placed her arms below her bust, her breathing heavy and inconsistent. &quot;You can&#39;t tell me that you don&#39;t want every girl you see to shove you into the wall, right?&quot; She let out a breath, her lower body shaking. &quot;I-I mean, they&#39;re so fucking hot... C-could you... leave for a minute?&quot; she asked, edging towards her computer. <br />
<br />
You roll your eyes, and leave her room. The instant you close the door, you can hear your sister moan. &quot;*I have a full-body mirror in my room*,&quot; you say, entering your room. You perform a few safety changes, saying &quot;*Emily cannot use the Veil on me in any way, shape, or form, without my permission. When touched by multiple people, the one who has been touching the Veil the longest is the only one who can use it*.&quot;<br />
<br />
You walk in front of the mirror, tying the veil around your wrist. You sigh as your sister moans again. You two argued relentlessly, fighting each other at every opportunity, and you did turn her into a bundle of lust and hormones... but you were the only one allowed to do that. If anyone else tried, they were getting a broken nose. You were still going to mess with her, of course, but you were going to make her life better. You cleared your throat and held up the Veil. &quot;*Emily&#39;s orgasms are twice as intense as normal, so long as they are given to her by another person*.&quot; That should give her some incentive to get laid. Now all you had to do was help her actually get laid.<br />
<br />
You came up with a plan about 4 moans (or about 10 minutes) later. Your plan was simple, and it would let you tease her relentlessly. Perfect. You got up from your bed, and stood in front of the mirror. &quot;*I am a very tall, muscled, dominant girl, with large breasts, wide hips, thick thighs, and a deep, dominant voice*.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your body warmed up, a faint tingle spreading from head to toe. Your hair was the first thing to change, a golden curtain covering your vision. You pull the hair out of your eyes, and whistle softly once you see how long it is. If you weren&#39;t wearing long socks, it would be tickling your feet. It is also exceedingly soft and silky. <br />
<br />
Your face shifts next, becoming a sculpted, angular wonder. Your eyes turn blue, becoming crystal clear and sharp. Your lips plump up slightly, your teeth straightening ever so slightly and turning pure white. Once you stop focusing on it, you gain an examining expression, as if you&#39;re in the middle of determining whether or not to squish a bug in front of you. Your neck bulks up, your Adam&#39;s apple disappearing. <br />
<br />
Your shoulders follow your neck&#39;s lead, slimming down yet also bulking up. The change flows down your arms, all body hair disappearing with pleasing tingles. The remaining skin is smooth and flawless, sculpted with muscle. It&#39;s just barely enough to preserve your increasingly feminine silhouette. Your hands also grow, fingers growing longer and slimmer. The middle two fingers on your right hand stay short, but the rest elongate, painting themselves in warm colours. <br />
<br />
Once you finish examining your new manicure, the change continues. You can feel the muscle build on your back, but your attention is swiftly taken by your quickly growing chest. They shoot past your sister&#39;s size and leap over the biggest pair in school. Your shirt is moments away from shredding itself beneath your massive breasts. You quickly get nude, just in time to see your new abs come in. Your nipples are rather small, considering the size of your mammaries. The Areola is, however, massive, and a deep pink colour, contrasting your sun-kissed skin.<br />
<br />
Your hips almost audibly creak as they expand, and your derriere grows as well. Your partner remains, as you notice that the tan of your arms has spread all the way around your skin. Your legs plump up, and you stumble as they grow longer. Your defined Adductors glide past each other, a small gap right between them. Your legs continue to grow longer, as the change settles down at your feet. <br />
<br />
You fall down on your bed, your johnson standing at attention beneath your tits. You angle yourself so that you can see your willy shrink in the mirror. You feel a brief sense of nausea, as your testicles slurp up into your perineum, becoming a new pair of ovaries. Your penis then inverts, becoming a plump, hidden vagina. <br />
<br />
You closed your eyes and breathed deeply as the sensation of transformation dissipated. Once you opened your eyes, your room had changed. At least, you assume so, since your bed had transformed from a hard, small, cheap thing which only you could sleep on, into an elaborate canopy bed, all in deep green. The curtains were drawn closed, with only a thin line of light coming from between them. It was insanely soft, the comforter giving way beneath your nude body. <br />
<br />
You rolled over to the side, noting the increased size. Even with your bigger body, you still couldn&#39;t reach more than one side at a time- although it was a near thing width-wise. Stepping out, your suspicions are confirmed. Pale white paint was replaced by vivid greens, and your gaming paraphernalia had turned into exercise gear. <br />
<br />
Wait, no, you were wrong- your games were in another corner. <br />
<br />
Various 1st place trophies and medals filled the new shelves, and you instinctively knew which one was for what. It seemed that you were quite the enlightenment girl- at least when it came to anything active. While you stride around your new room, you realise how... easy it is to move. You weren&#39;t a fatass, but you didn&#39;t like running. A few minutes, and you were out. Now however? <br />
<br />
You felt as though you could run a marathon without stopping.<br />
<br />
You smirked to yourself, approaching your closet. That is, until you remembered the Veil. A few declarations later, and you were dressed. Your olive-green top rides up your chest, revealing peaks of your chiselled abs. You don&#39;t need a bra. Your crotch is covered by a pair of boyshorts, and your legs are covered by skin-tight yoga pants, which do nothing to hide your muscled legs. A handbag finds its way into your hand, containing a wallet with her ID, cash, and a credit card with unlimited funds. <br />
<br />
A moan brings you back to your current situation. &quot;*Emily is a master at picking out clothes*,&quot; you say, approaching her door, &quot;*she has wanted to use me as a dress-up doll ever since I hit puberty, and will do almost anything to get me to the mall*.&quot;<br />
<br />
You knock on the door, and your sister squeaks out a &quot;Coming!&quot;. She opened her door rapidly, the scent of fem-cum hitting you like a brick. &quot;E-esmy!&quot; she stuttered. &quot;W-w-what can I, uh,&quot; she stuttered, blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily,&quot; you said, causing her to stop talking. &quot;Will you come with me to the mall?&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused for several seconds. &quot;W-wha-&quot;<br />
<br />
You pull her chin up, your thumb stroking her cheek. &quot;The mall, little one-&quot; you started, and her panties darkened immediately. &quot;You do remember how to speak, do you not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes!&quot; she said, rushing back inside. You follow, noticing a little white remote on the floor. Emily turns and notices you picking it up. &quot;H-hey, that&#39;s-&quot;<br />
<br />
You stride over, placing a finger on her lips. &quot;Now now, Emily,&quot; you whisper close to her. &quot;You know the rules~ *You&#39;re not allowed to control your own toys anymore- at least not outside the house*.&quot; You turn it off, one of your fingers trailing down her stomach. &quot;We wouldn&#39;t want you to lose control *again*-&quot; she whimpers, and you poke the area right above her crotch. While doing so, you turn the toy back on, putting it on full. &quot;But if you&#39;re a very good girl, I might be willing to take suggestions~&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook against your arm, a groan of pure pleasure leaving her throat. &quot;Y-yes, Esmerelda,&quot; <br />
<br />
You clicked your tongue, and reset the toy back to where it was. &quot;Good. Get ready to leave soon, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
You left her room, striding downstairs to the family car... which you apparently knew how to drive. You waited for your sister, using the Veil to make sure your trip to the mall would be entertaining.</p>
