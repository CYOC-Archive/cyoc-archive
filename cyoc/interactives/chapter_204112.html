<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Virginia decided to give her new body a test drive. She opened up her phone and looked at what were easily hundreds of messages from people trying to court her. Near the top were concerned questions from her friends, but she easily dismissed them with a simple. &#39;I&#39;m fine. See you later!&#39;, and she focused on what was truly important.<br />
<br />
After some quick browsing through her new phone history, it seemed every clique had had a piece of the pie, and it looks like she had her choice of pretty much whoever she wanted. As she went through her new list of contacts, which was easily double the size from when she was the alpha bitch of the school, she came across a particular contact named Earny, and her mind was suddenly filled with memories. She remembered Earnest Connors being one of her best friends. He was the president of the D&D club and one of the best DM&#39;s she had ever played with. His place always had the newest consoles and video games, and she remembered long discussions about various pop culture topics long into the night. He didn&#39;t have the biggest dick, and his body didn&#39;t exactly scream sex appeal, but he was a sweet boy which made him a generous lover.  She remembered her first time with him when she took his virginity, he came so quickly it was actually kind of adorable. Of course, she had put in plenty of work to make she he provided her with an appropriate amount of fucking and cum since then. she was decided, besides, she could always take some jocks monster cock later. &quot;Oh my gawd, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m gonna have sex with some sweaty nerd. . . and I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually kind of excited.&quot; She thought aloud.<br />
<br />
Her tree trunk thighs unconsciously rubbed together, the mere thought of approaching dick enough to get her going. She messaged him, &quot;Hey Earny! Meet me in the janitor&#39;s closet near the cafeteria. I won&#39;t take no for an answer! I don&#39;t care if we miss the first period. Oh and bring some snacks please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Earny responded in seconds. &quot;Sure thing Virginia!&quot;<br />
<br />
Virginia waddled her way towards the janitor&#39;s closet, her new memories letting her know that the janitor only had to use that closet on Wednesdays, making it a very convenient place for a nice quick fuck. When she entered the closet her udders immediately knocked over some cleaning supplies. The tight fit made her piggish body nothing short of a hazard to the various items placed on top of the numerous shelves in the closet. She took her top off, knocking down even more cleaning supplies in the process, her doughy arms struggling for a few seconds as she lifts the shirt over her beanbag breasts. Her bra is a little easier, the thing is so taught it practically flies off her body once she manages to unhook the thing. She doesn&#39;t bother with her pants, knowing that she might not be able to get them back on if she takes them off, the fabric practically acting as s second skin for her at this point. &quot;Maybe I should consider skirts in the future. . .&quot; Her thinking is interrupted, by the closet door opening, revealing a short freckled boy wearing thick glasses, and carrying a small bag of cookies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Earny!&quot; She yells excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey Virginia! Nice to see ya. I, um, brought you some cookies. . . &quot; Earnest blushes a deep red, still not quite used to the sight of Virginia&#39;s enormous naked tits. <br />
<br />
She snatches the cookies out of his hands. Munching on them with fervor as she realizes her drum-like belly hasn&#39;t been filled in forever. She speaks with her mouth full. &quot;Well. . . What are you waiting for? Get your pants off and fuck my titties already!&quot; Crumbs fly out of her mouth and fall into her veritable valley of cleavage, never to be seen again. &quot;Y-yes ma&#39;am!&quot; <br />
<br />
He quickly takes his pants and underwear off, revealing a modest 5 inches that&#39;s fully erect and ready for action. He shifts awkwardly in place, not even sure where to begin when dealing with such voluminous breasts. &quot;Go ahead and start, Earny! Don&#39;t blue ball me here!&quot; Earnest snapped out of it and unceremoniously shoved his cock into Virginia&#39;s cleavage. Her fun bags easily buried his cock, the appendage unable to be seen, but clearly felt. Virginia stifling a moan as her tit flesh ripples and jiggles like Jell-O. Earnest&#39;s thrusting causes her whole fat body to wiggle and writhe in pleasure. Virginia&#39;s hand shoves down her pants as she stimulates herself to add to the mountain of pleasure she&#39;s feeling. More items fall as her hip bumps one of the shelves, bouncing off her soft body as if they had landed on a trampoline instead of a human. &quot;Get into it Earny!&quot; she screams in pleasure, not caring if anybody can hear. He complies and slaps her right tit, a bright red hand marked clearly in place as her fleshy orbs wobble from the impact. &quot;I-I-&quot; Virginia cuts Earnest off, as she can tell what Earnest is trying to say, and dedicates both hands to squeeze her fat udders, applying as much pressure as possible onto Earnest&#39;s cock. He manages to hold out for a few moments, but it becomes too much for him, and he cums, blowing his entire load into Virginia&#39;s cleavage. Not a single drop of cum dripping onto the floor or anything else. Her cleavage managed to absorb his load completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-that was awesome! Thanks! Y-you really made my day.&quot; Earnest says, leaning back on the door to catch his breath. &quot;No problem. Always happy to help a man cum!&quot; She drooled as she squished her meaty tits together, feeling the warm cum stick to her breasts. She reaches a hand into her cleavage and gets her hand covered in cum, she brings it up to her mouth and starts to lick her hand as if it were ice cream. Earnest stares at the sight, his spent dick trying to get hard again. Looking at what he thought was the hottest girl ever licking up his own cum was a dream come true to the nerdy boy.<br />
<br />
The afterglow is cut short at the sound of a bell ringing. &quot;First period! Virginia I-I-&quot; He was cut short again. &quot;Hurry to class! Don&#39;t be late on my account!&quot;  <br />
Earnest nods, quickly getting his clothes back on. &quot;S-see you later! Thanks again!&quot; And with that Earnest rushes off to class. <br />
<br />
Virginia watches him go with a smile on her face, in no rush herself she takes her time hefting her shirt over her fat milkers. She forgoes the bra, deciding it isn&#39;t worth the effort to get back on if she&#39;s just gonna take it off soon anyway. She walks out of the janitor&#39;s closet and is met with an empty hallway. &quot;Everybody must be at class.&quot; she wonders aloud. &quot;Now what to do next? I guess the first order of business would be to clean these fat titties, but I don&#39;t know. . . The cum makes me feel warm inside. . .&quot; She walks off, having grabbed the bag of cookies from earlier, eating the sweets with the hand she used to lick up Earnest&#39;s cum.</p>
