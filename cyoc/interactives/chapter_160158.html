<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peace, prosperity, and procreating became the daily usual for all there at the farm, with the exception of Dave. His having more animals to care for meant more chores from sunup to sundown.<br />
<br />
Sheri was not much of a problem maker, as her wants were simplified to wallow, eat from the trough, and wait through her gestation time before her pig body would begin popping out her first litter of piglets. Her hog boar companion acted a bit feisty, as he was constantly in the mood for breeding, but had as then only one already pregnant Sow with him in the sty.<br />
<br />
Bob and Carol were constantly trying to get her pregnant, as Bob mounted Carol six to eight times each day when they were not grazing. The Veterinarian had checked both goats and specified they were in perfect health. However, after repeating mating sessions, Carol remained horny but did not become pregnant with a kid. Dave decided to purchase five more doe goats for Bob to breed, as to check if his semen was what might be the problem between Carol and her past lover. <br />
<br />
Bob was not the lover boy that Ted was, as he when human tried to marry Carol, but she married another fellow. Ted came to visit Dave, he another long lost friend from younger days. Ted meant nothing to Dave, and Dave acting as jolly did coax his foolish friend to do a standing leap over the goat pen fence, and then tasked him to corral the doe goat. His scheme worked on Ted as it had many other times before, giving then Ted his second life, with the body and lifestyle as becoming a buck goat to breed with Carol.<br />
<br />
Ted did not fight his changed new self, but quickly accepted his situation of being a buck goat. He loved Carol still and proved to her his kindly as loving manners, courting her similar to how horses do, until she stood with her hind legs spread, waiting for Ted to mount her.<br />
<br />
Sad as foolish, but after attending a regional Fair where Dave placed Ted into a herd sire breeder showing, Ted won a red ribbon. Ted gained a buck goat standard what other breeder farms wanted, and greedily, Dave leased Ted as a sire quite often. The sad part of what Dave had as a reminder was that while working as a sire, Ted was with his whole herd became wrestled, stolen, herded into stock trucks and sold for slaughter.<br />
<br />
Carol was horrifically saddened when Dave informed her about what became of Ted. She became angry toward Dave and refused to obey him.  So naturally, as after the twenty-year high school reunion party, friend Bob appeared one day, he wishing to renew a lost friendship.<br />
<br />
Bob had his troubles from life and spoke about them with Dave; who really did not give a care. Bob became bothersome to Dave, asking for them to go as do things Bob thought was fun, that took Dave away from his work at his farm. What had worked for Ted seemed easily likely the same scheme would coax Bob to many the same fatal mistake if he would jump, leap the goat pen fence. So, Bob accepted the taunt, he tried once to leap the fence but caught his left foot and fell outside the goat pen into a muck-puddle of goat urine deposited there by Carol.<br />
<br />
A week later and Bob returned to the farm, he greeted then Dave and turned as ran, Bob was a track and field athlete when in school; he running did leap into the goat pen and chased Carol until he caught her, and the farm curse made captive of Bob.<br />
<br />
Bob fought the curse, he being a religious man, a Catholic, he went to him church priest and pleaded for a prayer session with Bob kneeling and the four priests laying on of their hands to help bolster the prayer. Bob was head his changing face with holy water, but his use of that worked in favor of the curse and Bob&#39;s head conformed during one night of hellish pains and human fear. It was two weeks to the day when Bob drove into the farm driveway and he got out of his car did rush at to confront Dave.<br />
<br />
Dave had to chuckle at the memory of when a goat headed Bob arrived, as Dave expected Bob to want to kill Dave. Instead he fell to kneeling, as bleating and stuttering, informed of his gaining desire to become a buck goat. Dave then helped Bob, he housed and boarded his changing friend, waiting while watching, getting his jollies as Bob became a Kiko breed, a hearty big buck goat and seemed as elated and overjoyed for not being as human.<br />
<br />
Dave introduced Bob to Carol as though he were finding for her a blind date. As Carol recalled her memory of Bob the athlete, and nestling up to him, she ducked her head low and took to licking at his sheath and later his buck-goat penis. Their new lives were of sex and companionship, the likes of Dave stood as watched, feeling he had helped to rejoin and kindle a love affair.<br />
<br />
Bob did not feel ant ill will toward Dave, and nether did Carol. As it happened after the purchasing of the five doe goats to add to the herd, Bob roamed the whole pasture, while keeping watch of his horny herd.<br />
<br />
Summer became as fall, and with it the near neighbor family had an early graduation party for their son Dale. Dale though was no friend to Dave and occasionally would come with his friends to vandalize, they painted vile words on the barn front, but never did they leap a fence or bother the animals. The party was a Halloween party, or more so a drunken orgy. One of the boys wishing to get some girl into bed with him, had from the story told later, failed and felt humiliated by his friends at the party.<br />
<br />
Drunk and dismayed, he took to roaming, and when seeing in the nearby pasture the goats, he climbed over the fence, as tore his dress slacks, ripping them off from his body, they were there clinging to the fence the next morning. Charles, Charlie, or was it Chuck, but striped naked from the waist and down, his maleness held a musk scent that drew the doe goats to a possible stud.<br />
<br />
As Chuck did inform Dave the next morning, the goats surrounded him, they acted sexually friendly, interested, and he being drunk, well he mounted one and felt then ass if his manliness had found justice. He recalled having mated with three doe goats before from the alcohol and physical exertion, he fainted. About then sunrise he awoke, and was naked, covered with morning dew, saw then not his penis, but a furred, shaggy groin, two huge big balls and had grown a sheath for his then sixteen inches of narrowed, red colored penis.<br />
<br />
Horrified, Chuck tried to walk, as then he took note that his legs were not human like, but through the night of lust had changed, being the furry legs, hind hocks, elongated, narrowed feet with cloven hooves as all similar to the goats he had fucked. He crawled and staggered toward Dave&#39;s barn and was found then by Dave, as he was doing his early morning chores.<br />
<br />
A crier was Chuck, very emotional, while he struggled to explain, his penis popped out of its sheath, as the sight of it caused Chuck to scream and bat his changing hands at the cock, as if to drive it back into its furred home.<br />
<br />
Dave had to place restraints on Chuck, binding his legs together and dragging the crying fool into the barn, and put inside a box stall often used to house a breeder mare or donkey jennet for donkey Philly to breed as mate. The curse and the act of bestiality melded together to cause Chuck&#39;s body to change fully by the next day. When then Dave entered the barn all was quiet, and upon first checking the stall holding there Charles, Dave saw Chuck, he became a Boer breed buck goat and seemed content with being then a farm animal.<br />
<br />
Dave let Chuck meet Bob, and since they did not begin a fight, as by afternoon then Dave released Bob with Chuck following at a distance to entering the pasture holding six doe goats, three of whom had previously met Chuck!<br />
<br />
All in the pasture were at peace with their lives. However the near neighbors and the police were out looking for Charles, his parents wanted to find their son. The torn pants were found but to the luck of those doing the finding they did not jump the fences, as rather walked along the outside of the pasture fence to come an interrogate Dave as if he had kidnapped Charles.<br />
<br />
Dave was ahead of the investigators, as what clothes Chuck had on his person, Dave helped the boy remove and burned them to nothing by using his charcoal grill. Dave then owned another buck and a  big boy he was, bigger than Bob.<br />
<br />
The Police suspected foul play and saw Dave as their likely candidate. To date nineteen people had turned up as missing, all seemingly happening close to Dave&#39;s farm.<br />
<br />
That in mind, a teenage girl named Karyn came calling to Dave one day. She had a story of wanting to learn the basics of farming for a English class high school report. Her manners were excellent, but her details as to her writing a report were stupid and vague. Dave offered her a guided tour, showing her the two pigs in the sty. She pinched her nose from the stink as made Dave laugh.<br />
<br />
He pointed to the growing goat herd grazing far in the pasture. Next was the sire bull Dave leased, but owned only the bull. Dave took his guest to meet then Philly and his brother, they being Mammoth breed donkey jacks, where Philly scented the wafting scent of a nervous girl, he became aroused and horrified Karyn by showing her his full-on erect cock. Karyn dropped her notebook and ran, as ran home!</p>
