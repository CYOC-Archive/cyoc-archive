<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In cartoons, sometimes circumstances only happen to facilitate a particular, contrived plot without thought to plausibility or origin. If a prop is needed for a bit, or a character is required to be present to land a punch line, they&#39;re there for no other reason than &quot;it has to be&quot;. And that&#39;s why in the food refrigeration unit of a fancy restaurant where a pair of toon mice were about to raid it&#39;s stock after hours, a disembodied toon glove appears hovering above the shelves holding a sharpie marker. It <br />
nonchalantly levitates to simple cheese wedge, scribbles out what ever label it may have had and draws a radioactive hazard warning symbol on it instead. In the moments after, the once 3d, very real solid hunk of cheese has it&#39;s colors saturated, it&#39;s form contained within an inky black outline while simultaneously starts pulsing with a green iridescent glow. The floating hand gives an invisible camera a thumbs-up before popping out of existence. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The kitchen door swings wide open, a small white mouse, Jerry, standing eagerly in front of Rachel, a feminine brown toon mouse. He gestures ahead, sending and invitation to his date, &quot;After you, m&#39;lady.&quot; She wanders in, dazzled at the variety of utensils and tools, most of which she had no idea of what anyone would make with them. But all of that is a distraction on the way to the walk-in refrigerator. &quot;You&#39;ll find only the most fine cuisine, including exotic meats, fine wines, and of course...&quot;, Jerry opens the fridge door. &quot;Voila! pièce de résistance!&quot; On one of the mid shelves line a selection of cheeses; white to yellow to blue, containers, wheels and wedges, Rachel has never been so spoiled for choice in her life. <br />
<br />
They both dig right in. The sounds from the fridge, someone wouldn&#39;t be able to tell that a pair of mice had broken into the supply so much as if construction was underway. Bites and holes as big as a mouse&#39;s whole body are tunneled through everything. When one shelf was clear of naught but crumbs, they climbed to the next. The two happily indulged them selves until a green waft sent snaked its way through the air and across their noses. They both sniff the air, entranced by the new smell, following its direction as the green mist shapes into a wispy hand and beckons them along until they saw where it was bringing them. Far in the back, seemingly forgotten for god knows how long, a perfectly triangular wedge of Swiss cheese. It may have a slight greenish aura about it, but it smelled more alluring than any of the morsels that had come before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at this beauty!&quot; Rachel exclaims, approaching the unusual meal. &quot;This must be your best stuff, saving it for last.&quot; Jerry would admit that that would have been a good idea had he any idea that this old piece of cheese was here, but this is his first time finding it as well. &quot;ah.. right! Best for last!&quot; With that, Jerry withdraws a butcher&#39;s cleaver and chops the cheese in roughly equal measure. With a &quot;cheers&quot; they each stuff the hunks of yellow-green cheese into each other&#39;s  mouths. It goes down smoothly and pleasantly, leaving both mice noticeably more spherical than before they had their main course meal. <br />
<br />
The two both lay on the floor, basking in the delight of their full stomachs. They nearly drift to sleep, but are interrupted by their own tummies grumbling. <br />
&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Rachel asks. <br />
Rumble-grumble<br />
&quot;Hear that? The whole room is shaking!&quot; <br />
Rachel&#39;s and Jerry&#39;s bodies quake with the churning of their stomachs. &quot;I think... I think that cheese may have been bad... Hic-up!&quot; Rachel bounces up into the air before landing several inches taller than she was a moment ago (which is a lot when you started at less than half a foot). &quot;Oh! Oh my... Hic-up!&quot; Again, she shoots up a few inches, bringing her more than twice as tall as when she started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachel! How did you get so big?&quot; Jerry asks looking up at her. Then Jerry&#39;s own body shivers, &quot;I... HIC-UP!&quot; Jerry springs up to match her height. Now there are two mouse toons who each would be in the same weight class as a cat. &quot;HIC-UP!&quot; As a dog. &quot;HIC-UP!&quot; As a child. &quot;HIC-UP!&quot; Rachel and Jerry are about the same height and weight as their human counterparts. To keep up with their growing size, their proportions accommodate; instead of short stubby arms and legs, much of their growth favored lengthening out these limbs for balance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it over?&quot; Rachel asks in a much less squeaky, but still cute, voice. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jerry answers while scanning over himself; there is no mistaking it, Jerry and Rachel appear as cartoon adult anthro mice. And their in the nude. They always had been, but their new size brought some new anatomy with it. &quot;But I think more than just our size changed&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Rachel begins, but looks up from her own modest breasts to Jerry and goes slack jawed, her bottom jaw falling all the way to the floor with a pink lounge lulling out. Her eye pupils turn into pink hearts as she stares at the long flaccid shaft dangling between Jerry&#39;s legs. &quot;Jerry! You never introduced me to your friend down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jerry didn&#39;t know who she meant at first, but when he looked at Rachel and saw her own breasts capped with cute round nubs and a rapidly moistening slit between her legs, his new &quot;friend&quot; suddenly stood at attention. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too late for first impressions.&quot; He rushed up to her, pulling her waist close, letting his member press against her, and she reciprocated, grinding up against him. <br />
<br />
They move their romp out of the kitchen and onto one of the dining tables, she laid back while Jerry positions himself, letting his cock and her pussy kiss. Rachel hums, &quot;mmm, I think your friend and I are going to get along just fine.&quot; Jerry enters her, igniting a fire through both of them. He starts slowly, exploring her depths, letting each other get comfortable with the other. He picks up her legs for leverage, her toes curling with paws pointed at his face as Jerry picks up the pace, jostling her weighty tits up and down pendulously. He starts breathing heavily as she throws her head back biting her lip, the fire in them blazing while a pressure builds. She reaches a hand above his dick and rubs her clit as Jerry pumps as fast as he could into her. Then all at once, fireworks explode above the restaurant as the two lovers cum together, delivering his seed into her womb with each spasm as she cries out in quivering pleasure. <br />
<br />
Somewhere, in a place that looks similar to an Amazon distribution center, there is a fleet of cartoon storks who just received an order for a mouse to be delivered in 9 months time.</p>
