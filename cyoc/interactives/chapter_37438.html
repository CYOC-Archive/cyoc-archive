<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sit on the couch, watching the telly, waiting for your mother to discover you in Steph's clothing. One program ends and another begins. When it comes to a commercial break, you stand up and head for you sister's room.<br />
<br />
You can't help but think that something is off about the clothes you've chosen to wear. Going through the drawers once again, you pull out a long sleeve, white shirt with a hood. Taking off the t-shirt, you pull the long sleeve one on instead. It's really soft against your skin and the sleeves go down past your wrists. Feeling like this is better, you head back to the living room, the feeling passing that something was off about the clothes.<br />
<br />
Sitting back down on the couch, you've only gotten comfortable, when you hear from the kitchen, &quot;Thomas, can you please come here?&quot; Figuring your about to catch hell for what you're wearing, you stand up once again in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
But when you arrive there, you receive a bit of confusion instead. Looking at you, holding a plastic box that that has a bunch of Steph's earrings and hair pieces in it, your mom tells you, &quot;Come here princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure of what to do, trying to wrap your mind around what mother just called you, you make your way to wear she is sitting at the table. When you are finally standing in front of her, she tells you, &quot;Turn around princess, so that I can braid your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Complying, you turn and feel mother doing something with your red hair, which now falls past your shoulders. Next she turns you around and asks, &quot;Hoops or studs?&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment passes and you tell her quietly, &quot;Hoops, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother nods and withdraws a pair of small, plastic hoop earrings.  One is purple and the other is of a matching blue. Reaching up, she undoes the backing and slides each into your ear. Afterward, she tells you, &quot;You’re mommy's little princess,&quot; and gives you a kiss on the nose. <br />
<br />
Turning you around, she you a gentle slap on the butt, which is combined with a nudge forward, and tells you, &quot;Go watch you morning cartoons.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the living room, you are about to sit down, when you decide to go to the bathroom. Inside, you drop your one piece bib-overalls and underwear and sit down on the toilet to pee. After you're finished, you stand and hike up your drawers, but not before tucking your penis and testicles back.<br />
<br />
As you wash your hands, you glance into the mirror. You're not sure if you are looking at a boy or a girl. The soft skin, braided dark red hair and earrings enhance the view that you're looking at a very pretty girl. You still stand about five foot five, which confuse you because if you look at your reflection just right, you look about three foot two. The only other thing that bothers you is when you remember that you’re seventeen and a junior at the local High School; you can’t put your finger on it, but something tells you that you are older then that.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, you finish washing, dry your hands and let the sleeves of your shirt hang past your wrists, covering up your hands. As you leave the bathroom, you run into your sister, who mutters to you, &quot;Good morning Kim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not sure how to respond, you bid her a good morning and head back to the living room. As you sit and watch the telly program, you think things over. You grasp that the Amulet of Zulo has something to do with your situation and why you act like a girl sometimes. &quot;If only I knew where it disappeared to, I could see if there is a way to reverse what's happening,&quot; you tell yourself.<br />
<br />
The thing you can’t figure out is, you are a boy, and the organ between your legs confirms this. But Steph addresses you as Kim when you have girl’s clothes on. And mother obviously sees you as her daughter, because she calls you 'Princess'.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why does she still call me Thomas sometimes instead of Kim or some other girl's name?&quot; you ask yourself.<br />
<br />
Not having an answer to any of your problems, you snuggle closer to Miss. P.U. and turn your attention back to the cartoons playing on the telly. After a bit, you are joined by your sister, who is now dressed for the day and carrying a bowel of cereal.<br />
<br />
After lunch, mom takes you and your sister to the Carnivale for the day. Nobody says a thing or suspects that you are a boy in girls clothing, but it does bother you a bit that when you say to your mom, &quot;I have to go pee,&quot; she takes you to the ladies bathroom to do your business.<br />
<br />
Later you win from a gyp joint an Angelina Ballerina plush and your sister wins a plush Strawberry shortcake doll. After that, you're both given dinner at one of the various food stalls. <br />
<br />
All in all, the whole day passes in a whirl and you're to busy enjoying the rides and such to give much thought to the fact of what you have on. The only small reminder of your true sex and gender is when you go to use the bathroom. Afterward, you ride home, cuddling your new stuffed animal, sleepy and wanting to fall asleep right there in the back of the car.<br />
<br />
The next day, you wake up with two ideas forming in your head. First, you take a shower and put on your normal male clothes, which are kind of baggy because you're become thinner. In the kitchen, you mother greets you as Thomas and not her 'Princess' and the same goes for your sister who doesn’t greet you as Kim.<br />
<br />
Lying in your room later, you look around and when you see the white dresser with the white knobs, plus the white carpet on the floor, you can't help but think that something has changed in here, but can't quite put your finger on it. Instead you hug your stuffed animals and turn your thoughts to what you've figured out in just the past two days.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I dress like a girl, people will see me that way. If I dress like a boy, everyone sees me like that,&quot; you tell yourself as you play with the earring dangling from your ears.<br />
<br />
Getting up, you head for where you keep your allowance. Seeing that you've saved up well over two hundred dollars, you take some and head for the local department store. There you purchase a skirt that has a hidden zipper on the right side, is flat from your waist down to wear your legs start and blooms out into a three tier design. All in all, you figure it comes down to you knees.<br />
<br />
With this skirt, you purchase a pair of low-cut bikini briefs, a matching white blouse, a pair of shoes that go with the outfit and after much thought, a bra.<br />
<br />
Taking all this home, you prepare yourself for school the next day. When Monday comes, you shower and debate whether you should attend school wearing the clothes you bought yesterday. After weighing the pros and cons you figure to go with your original idea. <br />
Wearing these clothes you notice that they're much different then wearing your sister's clothes. The only real problem you have is with the bra, but you manage to put it on and tucking your manhood once again between your legs you head out to the kitchen for breakfast.<br />
<br />
Sitting down at the kitchen table, your mother greets you and once again says nothing about your attire. Doing your hair up in another braid, she hands you a jean jacket and wishes you a good day at school. Feeling that everything is going to be okay, you return her kiss, brush a strand of black hair from your face and picking up your backpack, putting on the shoes bought yesterday and head off to high school. <br />
<br />
To you, you're just a junior worried about her appearance, trying to adjust to the world around you and the fact that you have a penis and testicles instead of the normal female equipment; luckily, only you know this secret.</p>
