<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brett, Antonio, Carl, Mike and Tyler huddled up together, even though these spiritual beings were hovering in mid-air in their invisible states at about thirty feet above the ground, overlooking the piles of clothing on the grass below. <br />
<br />
“Guys! This is so cool!” Antonio grinned. “Let’s go back to campus and have fun with our friends and classmates!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah but, what do you want to do? Buff up other athletes? They’re already muscular, like us!” Mike pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Dudes… Right now, NOBODY is as muscular or as powerful as we are! Trust me!” Carl laughed, as he flexed his arms, causing mighty biceps to rise up from his thick pythons. “We’re like GODS now!”<br />
<br />
“Well, I say we recruit some of the ordinary guys… Like some non-athletes!” Tyler suggested. “I know there are a couple of them in some of my classes!” <br />
<br />
“Alright! Let’s GO!” Antonio shouted as he started to fly towards the university campus. Within a few seconds, the five flying teens reached the heart of their campus and landed by the entrance of the math building. They walked right into the building by passing through the wall, and they passed numerous students who never saw them since they were invisible. <br />
<br />
It was already late in the afternoon and most classes were already over for the day, but a few students were hanging around and finishing up their assignments in the computer labs. As the five teens strolled around the halls, they passed one of the computer labs where a lone student was still finishing up a programming assignment at a computer terminal in the lab when a lady walked in.<br />
<br />
“Ethan! I hate to tell you this but you need to finish up, son! I need to mop the floor!” the lady said to the boy. “I just hate to have to be the one to tell you to leave every afternoon, but it’s that time of the day again!<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Miss Jane!” the young man said, as he saved his work on the computer as he put his books away. “I guess I need to go home!” <br />
<br />
Ethan slowly walked out of the computer lab and wandered out into the empty hallway, not knowing that he was being watched by five invisible beings.<br />
<br />
“Bingo!” Antonio grinned. “We have our new recruit!”<br />
<br />
“Talk about a computer nerd!” Mike grinned. “Ethan is the last one in the lab every day!”<br />
<br />
“I know him! He’s in my math class!” Tyler laughed. “He’s really smart! Let’s buff him up and then make him one of us!” <br />
<br />
The other four nodded in agreement as they put their plan into action. <br />
<br />
The boys hovered above the lonely boy’s head as he slowly walked down the hall towards his locker.<br />
<br />
When Ethan had stopped in front of his locker, unlocked the combination locked, and placed his books away and finally closed the door, Brett decided to take action.<br />
<br />
Ethan was about to pick up his backpack from the floor and walk towards the exit, when he noticed that he couldn’t move his legs… Or his arms… He was completely frozen!<br />
<br />
“What… What’s going on? I can’t move!” Ethan said to himself.<br />
<br />
Then, in a flash, ALL his clothes disappeared… including his glasses! He was standing in the hallway by his locker, all alone, and BUTT NAKED!<br />
<br />
“ACK! I’m NAKED! HELP! Somebody… HELP! I can’t see!” he shouted. <br />
<br />
He panicked as he looked around the hallway. At first, everything seemed blurry since his vision was so poor. Then, something AMAZING happened. Unknown to Ethan, Brett walked up to him and placed his hands over Ethan’s eyes, instantly correcting the boy’s poor vision. Suddenly, he could see! His vision was PERFECT… and that was WITHOUT his glasses! Ethan blinked several times and gasped as he looked around the hallway and marveled at his new 20/20 vision!<br />
<br />
“Somebody p-p-please h-h-help m-m-me…” Ethan said in a trembling voice. The poor freshman began to wonder if someone was pulling a cruel prank on him. Since he was rather short – only 5-foot-4 inches tall – and being that he was only a freshman, he was an easy target for bullies.  But that was not the case, even though he didn’t know it yet.<br />
<br />
Next, Antonio finally got his turn to use his powers and do what he had been ITCHING to do all this time. He so wanted to buff up somebody that it was driving him crazy! Well, Ethan was a short, skinny guy, so now Antonio had a LOT to work with!<br />
<br />
“Time to give Ethan some power in his legs!” Antonio grinned as he walked up to Ethan and squatted before the boy. Then, he placed his hands around Ethan’s calves, making them inflate like balloons the moment his hands touched the boy’s skin. Antonio passed his hands over Ethan’s legs, molding them into thick, long rock-solid pillars of bulging muscle like he was working with clay or Play-Doh! Then, he stood up and did the same with Ethan’s quads, gently passing his hands over his legs above the knees, causing his muscles to grow everywhere his hands touches his skin.  All Ethan could do was moan softly as he witnessed and felt his leg-muscles grow in size, weight and strength right before his very eyes! When Antonio was done, Ethan had the legs of a professional cyclist or marathon runner!<br />
<br />
“My turn to work on him!” Carl suggested, as he walked up to the VERY confused boy who now had such muscular legs, that it looked like he had just come from competing in the Olympics. But Carl loved guys with awesome upper body strength, so he was determined to give Ethan his best! <br />
<br />
Carl placed his hands over Ethan’s flat stomach and instantly an eight-pack consisting of washboard abdominal muscles came to the surface. Ethan was now ripped with rows and columns of buttons on his stomach resembling tiles on a kitchen floor more defined than a cobblestone brick road! Next, Carl gently rubbed his hands over Ethan’s chest, allowing his pectorals to swell up and expand, becoming bigger and bigger and BIGGER… Making the boy’s shoulders incredibly WIDE! Ethan now had an impressive V-taper with wide lats, with brick-like pectorals sticking out from his chest. Thick delts filled out the top of his shoulders, giving him that linebacker-look. And lastly, Carly worked on Ethan’s arms. Those biceps just grew and grew until they were as big and as round as bowling balls, attached to mighty, thick arms that were now as thick and as strong as pythons. Mighty thick veins covered his arms everywhere, transporting blood to all the muscles as needed. Yes, this kid would be STRONG from now on. NOBODY would ever think TWICE about bullying this boy!<br />
<br />
When Carl was done, he stepped back as he joined Brett, Antonio, Mike and Tyler as they stood there and admired their handiwork. Brett then caused Ethan to be able to move again, so Ethan could grow accustomed to his new bulk and weight. <br />
<br />
When Ethan noticed that the strange growth spurts had ended, he opened his eyes and looked down. For a moment, it seemed as if his mind had been placed into another person’s body! Then, he realized that he still had his own body just that all his muscles had grown dramatically! He had become incredibly muscular!<br />
<br />
“What…. What happened? What… What’s going on?” Ethan wondered quietly as he looked down over his incredibly muscular arms and legs, taking turns flexing them. <br />
<br />
“We’re responsible for your new look, Ethan!”<br />
<br />
Then, Ethan looked up and saw five tall, super-muscular young men standing before him! Ethan only recognized Tyler, who happened to be in his math class. <br />
<br />
“What? Who are you… TYLER!” Ethan shouted, as he recognized one of his classmates. <br />
<br />
Just then, Brett closed his eyes and made the orange lamp appear out of nowhere. It appear in the palm of his hand! Brett rubbed the lamp and genie, the Jenig, came out of the spout of the lamp in a large plume of smoke, filling the entire hallway up to the ceiling!<br />
<br />
“Greetings, my Master!” the genie said to Brett! “What is your bidding?” <br />
<br />
“Genie! This boy over here is Ethan! Please make him just like the five of us and award him the same powers and abilities!” Brett commanded the genie as he pointed his finger at Ethan. <br />
<br />
Then Genie then aimed his hands at Ethan, with red smoke coming from his fingertips. The red smoke quickly engulfed Ethan, entering his body through every way possible. Within moments, Ethan began to experience the same transformations that the other five had experienced, transforming into a superhuman and divine being with limitless powers! <br />
<br />
“UHHHH!” Ethan groaned out loud while the others watched in eager anticipation as Ethan’s legs grew even longer and more muscular, as well as his torso and arms. The boy became taller and bigger, until he was as tall as the other five ultimate beings! Ethan also gained the superhuman powers of flight, mind control and transformations, as well as the ability to become anything, manipulate anything, and to read minds. Aside from being immortal, Ethan was also super strong and practically omnipotent, just like the other five guys.<br />
<br />
Finally, the smoke dissipated and the Genie faded back into the lamp, which disappeared. As the boys looked on, they saw Ethan grinning while hovering a foot above the ground.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the club, dude!” Tyler said, as he flew up to the boy and gave him a hug.<br />
<br />
“Ohh, good… So this isn’t just a thing for members of the track team only, right?” Ethan asked. <br />
<br />
“No, silly! We want to recruit a few guys who aren’t athletes at all… That’s why we got you!” Tyler explained.<br />
<br />
“Good! I know guys in the computer club, the chess club, and the math club!” Ethan grinned. <br />
<br />
“I want to recruit at least two football players!” Brett said to them. <br />
<br />
“Let’s split up and hit one of the local high schools!” Antonio suggested. “My cousin plays on the football team and I want to get him as well!” <br />
<br />
The boys decided to split up and to make more of them into “Ultimate Beings”…</p>
