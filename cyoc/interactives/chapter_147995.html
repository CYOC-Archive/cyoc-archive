<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin couldn&#39;t resist. Maybe to a 12 year old, a 9 inch cock was huge, but to Dustin it was routine. He decided that the boy really needed a little more. Just an extra 3 inches and he could be a whole foot long! Dustin whistled, then ran to find the boy.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Nate weaved through the crowd as fast as he dared, looking for the nearest restroom. He kept telling himself that it was an optical illusion, a trick of the light. But at the same time, he had felt it when he had reached in. Maybe it was possible he had touched something else by chance? His leg perhaps? People&#39;s cocks didn&#39;t grow in one day... did they?<br />
<br />
Nate didn&#39;t even know how it happened. He remembered sitting on the bench in the middle of the mall, talking to his mother and promising to come home before dinner. He had felt a tingle go through his cock and balls, but dismissed it as some cold air flowing over them. He had continued to talk to her for another half a minute, then wished her well and hung up. After he had hung up, he noticed that his shorts felt really tight against his cock. Not anything unusual, as Nate was starting to discover, his old underwear was just beginning to be outgrown. But this felt different, much more constraining. Nate had reached into his shorts, intending to reposition his cock and balls to make more room available to them. But instead of grabbing his cock, he had felt a thick tube of flesh that almost felt alien. Confused, he put down his phone. Instead of the (relatively) flat front area of his shorts that he was expecting, he saw the front of his shorts bulging out. He could still see the image etched in his mind: a long tubular bulge that snaked from his underwear to near the opening of the shorts leg. Below it were two more circular bulges. <br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s mind had instantly gone into overdrive, as he tried to explain it. The outlines of the bulges looked just like Nate&#39;s cock and balls, with the main difference being that they were 2 to 3 times bigger than they should have been. He felt like he needed to get to somewhere more private and explore, and the bathroom was the first thing he thought of.<br />
<br />
Back to the present, Nate continued to weave through the crowd. Dodging the crowd, only two things were on his mind - the image of the enormous bulge, and the increase in weight he felt in his groin. It wasn&#39;t exactly heavy, but it was definitely more so than before, and it created a sort of heft to his step.<br />
<br />
Finally! Nate thought as he entered the men&#39;s bathroom and quickly ran to the handicapped stall, as it was the biggest. Once there and after making sure no one else was using the bathroom, he ventured to look down.<br />
<br />
Although the bulge had shifted due to his now-upright position, it was still very obvious. A clearly tubular bulge erupted from Nate&#39;s groin and traveled halfway down the leg of his shorts, stopping several inches short of the left leg hole of the shorts. Below the tube, two circular bulges were still visible, though they seemed to have diminished in size. Nate, with great anticipation, dropped both his shorts and boxers.<br />
<br />
If there was any doubt that Nate&#39;s cock and balls had grown, it was gone now. A large python now snaked out of Nate&#39;s groin and hung low, halfway to his knee. Below it, two nearly perfectly-rounded tennis-ball-sized nuts hung low. Nate&#39;s jaw dropped. They looked almost exactly like his old cock and balls, except that they were much bigger.<br />
<br />
As Nate looked more, he started to panic. What had caused the mysterious growth to happen so quickly? And would it happen again? He didn&#39;t know, but he did know that no 12 year old boy normally had a huge cock like this. He quickly pulled up his shorts again, and tried to figure out if there was a way to hide his cock and balls.<br />
<br />
After trying several different ways to hide the bulge, he gave up. There was no hiding his new member. He fed it down his left shorts leg, which would work for the moment until he decided to do something else with it. Nate decided to go home as soon as possible, he could experiment in privacy there. He left the restroom...<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Dustin was getting frustrated. Where was that boy? Suddenly he spotted the boy again, coming from the direction of the restroom. Dustin followed his line of sight and realized that the boy intended to leave. Oh no you don&#39;t! Dustin thought and stared hard at the boy.<br />
<br />
Immediately he saw the boy slow with concern at first, but then pleasure. Dustin could also see that the boy&#39;s cock, already huge, was beginning to grow again. It swelled longer and longer, thicker and thicker. Dustin also saw the boy&#39;s balls, previously only tennis-ball-sized, blow up to the size of softballs. Dustin kept staring, and the boy&#39;s cock kept getting longer. It was now the thickness of a can of Coke, and Dustin estimated it to be 11 inches long fully soft! As Dustin kept staring, the boy&#39;s cock kept growing... it cleared 12 inches. As the boy&#39;s cock continued to grow, it became so long that the head of the boy&#39;s cock actually emerged out of the bottom of his shorts! Dustin figured that was enough and quit staring. He estimated the boy had to be endowed with at least 14 inches of cock.</p>
