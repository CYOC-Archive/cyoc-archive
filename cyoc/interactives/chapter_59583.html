<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite warnings Steve left no different then when he entered.  He was only there for a few hours, he put on a <br />
mask of interest through their lectures on the importance of physical activity, the difficulty of maintaining <br />
a high GPA while being a jock, the dedication and training needed to play a sport.  He couldn’t fathom it; <br />
everyone there reeked of science, discovery and logical knowledge so why were they defending primitive <br />
pastimes like sports?  They should be on my side, he thought.  <br />
His parents drove him home sadly, they had been promised ‘progress was made and would take some time to show’ <br />
but there son seemed as miserable and misanthropic as ever.  He went to bed sulking and arose the next morning <br />
sulking.  They drove him to school with the desperate hope that this would be the day they picked up a <br />
different, happier and more athletic son.  Little did they know this day their prayers would be answered.<br />
Steve sat in the back of Geometry class listening to the insufferable mutterings of the imbeciles and fools <br />
surrounding him.  The teacher droned in a mechanical voice, mindlessly echoing an overly simplistic, dictated <br />
lecture.  Steve knew she was rather intelligent but couldn’t comprehend why schools made teachers go so slow <br />
and teach to them as if they were all idiots.  They should work at a higher level, let those who can’t keep up <br />
fail and suffer.  The world has no room for idiots.<br />
“So David what does A squared plus B squared equal?”  She asked, nodding toward the hulking captain of the <br />
basketball team.  He was actually a senior and big for that even but he had failed his first run through the <br />
class and needed to pass it now or risk not graduating.<br />
“Um, A squared plus B squared equals…” his deep, resounding words slowly faded out into senseless mumbling as <br />
the petty wheels in his head squealed and screamed, trying hard to answer.  He was sweating, struggling. <br />
“Oh its so simple you brainless, testosterone fueled moron…”  All heads turned to face Steve, arms folded <br />
across his chest scoffing at the captain who sunk several inches in sad embarrassment.  Steve failed to take <br />
heed of the electric feeling that began to sweep through his mind and body so filled was he with self-<br />
righteous rage.<br />
“Well then Steve, do tell us the answer.”  She sighed and turned to him, used to his antics and tantrums.  She <br />
knew he was a good kid and secretly mourned for his troubled heart.  But as Steve opened his mouth he realized <br />
he didn’t know the answer, he couldn’t remember it no matter how hard he tried.  All that came out was some <br />
meaningless stuttering and muttering not unlike what David had been doing.  The rest of the class laughed <br />
thinking he was just mocking David.  Steve was saved from being embarrassed as David was by the bell ringing <br />
and he fled the classroom with gusto but not as quickly as David did.  David, titanic as he was, vanished <br />
quickly in a flurry of movement, humiliated.  Steve meanwhile stumbled through the halls, his vision blurry, <br />
and his coordination gone.  He felt sick and confused.  His muscles throbbed, something strange pumped through <br />
his veins and his brain began to cloud, losing its genius IQ and intelligent thoughts.  He held his hands in <br />
front of his eyes, feeling his clothing tighten, his body overheating, sweating.  His strides seemed longer as <br />
if his legs had lengthened His drunken steps led him unknowingly into the locker-room where coincidently David <br />
was pounding his locker, still bent over Geometry.  Steve saw him there through his foggy vision and instantly <br />
felt a strange wave of sympathy and shame.  He didn’t know why but he began to appreciate the work David must <br />
put into his sport and feel bad for him not doing too well in school despite trying his best.  He opened his <br />
mouth feeling a lump swelling in his throat.<br />
“David… I, I’m like sorry man for, for what happened back in class, you know?”  His words came out deeper and <br />
jumbled, causing him further panic.  David turned and saw the nerd who had humiliated him so thoughtlessly and <br />
for a moment considered pounding him despite never hitting someone in his life.  But his fury turned to a <br />
shadow of concern as he noticed Steve was barely standing, his skin glowed lunar white shedding floods of <br />
sweat and his eyes rolled vacantly.  Before either could say anything Steve fell to the floor in a pile of <br />
aching, changing limbs.  David watched in fascination as Steve contorted and changed before his eyes.  He <br />
grew, stretching and spreading across the ground.  From a short 5’5” he grew into a mighty 6’5”, his legs <br />
snaking across the ground, expanding beyond what his nerdy jeans were ever meant to handle.  First came the <br />
shoes which were destroyed by his swelling feet, a whooping size 17 now.  He groaned in pain feeling more of <br />
his intelligence slip, his mind warping.<br />
“What the fuck is happening to you man?”  David was petrified by interest and repulsion but he felt a twinge <br />
of fear for his once foe who may be dying or something for all he knew.<br />
“I don’t fucking know dawg!”  Steve bellowed in a dropping voice, surprising even himself.  “This shit is <br />
weird!”  He wanted to scream as his jeans slowly tore, the tear raced straight up both legs, ripping his jeans <br />
to shreds and revealing his long legs.  Under his clothes they had mysteriously tanned a bit, the muscles had <br />
developed into lean basketball players legs and the fickle dark hairs had been replaced by a spread of dark <br />
brown.  He moaned as his upper legs changed, his equipment swelling to an appropriate size for a jock, indeed <br />
a 6’5” one.  He ripped open his own shirt, both watching in wonder as his pecs slowly rose up, like watching a <br />
mountain form in slow motion.  His stomach rippled and distorted, grooves appearing as a six pack replaced a <br />
flat belly and a treasure trail appeared.  Tuffs of brown arm pit hair became visible as he desperately <br />
extended a changing arm towards David, who helped him up as his arms bulked up and hands swelled to better <br />
palm basketballs.  David stared as Steve doubled over, his back rippling and quickly becoming ripped.  He <br />
stumbled slowly towards a mirror just in time to watch his face change, the features losing their childishness <br />
and nerdiness, becoming cute but masculine.  His jaw line sharpened, with a jutting chin and charming, perfect <br />
white smile.  His features were more tan and attractive, his nose a little smaller and rounder, his eyes deep <br />
green instead of brown and his hair shorter, styled and light brown.  Standing in just boxers was a tall, lean <br />
and tan 17 year old, alluring and sweating like a pig the only flaw his horror struck face.  “Fuck I look, I <br />
look like…”<br />
“A basketball player…” David finished as his jaw dropped in awe of the miracle he had just witnessed.  Still <br />
partially mesmerized David grabbed a nearby ball and tossed it to Steve who caught it effortlessly, spun it <br />
and dribbled some despite earlier loathing the thing.  He lost control of the ball though and stumbled a bit.  <br />
He managed to reclaim it with some difficulty and shot for the practice hoop nearby, missing by a mile.  <br />
Though the chip had drained his intelligence a good bit, changed his body and given him enough of an <br />
adjustment to grudgingly act like a basketball player it had not given him the knowledge and skill that only <br />
comes through practice.  He would have to train like any other jock.  In the back of his mind a voice <br />
whispered to Steve informing him of what had been done and what must be done.<br />
“I’m, stuck like this… Until I play and help you guys win a game of basketball…”  He whispered just loud <br />
enough for David to hear.  David considered this, this guy had not an hour ago completely humiliated him, <br />
should he help him learn the game just so he could get back to his nerdy, unbearable self?<br />
“Here, James, put these on.”  David tossed him a spare pair of slides, socks, workout shorts and a black wife <br />
beater.  Hesitantly he put them on, they actually fit quite well and somehow he kind of liked the feel of <br />
them.<br />
“Thanks but my name is Steve…”  <br />
“No, Steve was this nerdy douche bag that made a fool of me today, I would never be seen with him and no one <br />
would ever believe you were him.  So for now you’re James.  I’ll tell my rents you’re a friend from school and <br />
you can stay at my place for awhile.  Maybe, maybe I’ll help you with your aim and stuff so you can try out <br />
for the team this season and get your old life back eventually.  But looks like you’re stuck like this for <br />
awhile so I suggest you be nice to me and try to learn what its like to be a basketball player.”  James nodded <br />
solemnly and followed David to his car to go to his place.  David put on his favorite Eminem CD and at first <br />
James started to object but he sat back, actually nodding along, slowly starting to talk to his new friend <br />
about basketball and the training ahead and somewhere along the way to David’s house James actually smiled for <br />
the first time in years.</p>
