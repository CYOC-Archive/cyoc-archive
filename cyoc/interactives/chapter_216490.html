<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Poor Emily McLeod was completely in the dark at everything Eve was saying to her.<br />
<br />
Evelyn Kazinski was her very best friend, for intents and purposes her sister from another mother, and now not only had had her closest pal in the word turned on a dime into a raving lunatic the second she decided to indulge that weird Willow Strasserman girl, now she...now Eve was this fat old hag standing in front of her!<br />
<br />
She watched with horror as the now middle aged Eve, actually looking far older than that, having accrued some city miles on her, pointed her fat finger into the middle of her palm, which was holding a pretty little green teardrop shaped gemstone between the excessive skin folds.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you&#39;d help me for once!&quot; the former popularity queen croaked out in her husky voice, which sounded addled from years of alcohol and tobacco abuse. Then her hand seemed to begin radiating an unearthly green glow.<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s eyes widened in shock<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
...and then realization.<br />
<br />
Wait a minute, is that gemstone magic or something? Like out of Supernatural? That would explain why Eve is old now! the eighteen year old thought silently to herself.<br />
<br />
One of Emily&#39;s guilty pleasures, which she didn&#39;t like admitting in front of people, was that she was a huge fangirl of horror movies, and her favorite TV show was Supernatural. Her mind was already primed to accept the existence of paranormal relics like the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone since she had seen so many variations of the scenario before, like in Wishmaster.<br />
<br />
Maybe if I can break that thing, I can reverse the curse, and bring Eve back to normal!<br />
<br />
She watched as the otherworldly green glow slowly began to create wisps of green smoke that slowly filled the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!!&quot; screamed the pretty brunette cheerleader, her body leaping on top of Eve to try and wrestle the accursed thing away from her friend, knocking them both to the floor. She began to pry open Eve&#39;s thick, sausage like fingers...<br />
<br />
&quot;LET GO!&quot; bellowed Eugene in his new voice, sounding surprisingly mean and bitter, as if the new Eve had gone through an even harder life than her formerly male self had. She slapped Emily in the face with her free hand, assaulting her for the third time that day. Given that Eve now weighed at least as twice as much as the rather slender Emily, this slap hurt, knocking the beautiful girl a significant distance across the bathroom from Eve, underneath the sinks.<br />
<br />
Emily cried to herself about how insane and impossible this all was, her seemingly picture book existence, with almost everything going for her, having been torn away in an instant by a magic stone.<br />
<br />
She looked on with fearful eyes as the stone&#39;s glow intensified in Eve&#39;s hand, and then let off a blinding flash of light...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
The next thing Emily and Eugene both heard was the shrill cry of two dozen middle aged voices.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! MY! GOD!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they heard a stampede of feet rush towards the ladies room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap, what now?&quot; Emily asked herself in a voice that sounded slightly off from the one she had a moment ago, slowly pushing herself out of the cavity underneath the sink and up on her feet again. She turned around and looked at herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY SHI...&quot; muttered the Scottish-American girl, unable to finish her blasphemy as the stampede of feet rushed inside the medium sized lavatory. She was immediately pushed aside by a now very matronly Vanessa Chandler gazing with terror at her thickened body and her short, butch looking haircut, appearing ridiculous in her now much too small cheerleader uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so old looking!&quot; loudly moaned Lindsey Moon in the mirror next to Vanessa as she appraised the wrinkles on her now weather beaten face, the crows feet dominating everything. She picked at strands of her fading dark hair as she saw streaks of grey running through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve turned into my mother!&#39; stuttered Gloria Vanapoulous quietly from behind Lindsey, in clear shock.<br />
<br />
Well, not exactly her mother, but close enough for the resemblance to be uncanny. The usually arrogant beauty began breathing rapid and shallow, worried that she was about to have a panic attack over this unexpected transformation, not appreciating that while she was indeed older, she was actually still rather attractive in a MILF sort of way, and she was one of the girls who had been affected the least by Eugene&#39;s wish.<br />
<br />
Certainly not as bad as Alicia Adams, who had the great misfortune of developing arthritis and degenerative scoliosis in her old age She took one look at her mature, fiftyish looking face, her brown hair half gray now, and hobbled out of the bathroom, looking for a place to sit down so she wasn&#39;t in agonizing pain.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, yet another cheerleader, Kaitlyn Irby, was crying as she poked at the imperfections on her now withered chocolate covered skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a date tonight!&quot; she cried in her throaty, mature sounding voice. &quot;Brad will never want to go out with me now!&quot; as her friend April Huang gave her a supportive hug.<br />
<br />
For what seemed like an eternity, the squad all primped and sobbed and worried what the hell was going on, if anyone would even recognize them anymore, if anyone would even love them anymore now that they were old and fat and disgusting, and how to return to normal.<br />
<br />
No one stopped to look at Eve, or had put two and two together that her outburst may be connected to this very strange turn of events.<br />
<br />
Gradually, the girls of Shermer High&#39;s cheerleading team left the bathroom and filled out into the hallway, all of them quite a sight in their ill fitting outfits, all looking like middle aged women on the way to a Bon Jovi concert. Several of them grabbed their phones out of their purses and called their parents. Each call was unique, but all sounded something in the ballpark of;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, you are NOT going to believe this!&quot;.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
As the last girl, Victoria Mattingly, left the room in tears, Emily McLeod took an opportunity to finally get a look at her new self.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, Eve, what did you do?&quot; as she saw her friend hiding in one of the stalls out of the corner of her eye.<br />
<br />
Emily gulped at her new body.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the middle aged woman staring at Emily through the mirror was now visibly overweight, though not as bad as Eve, Vanessa, or a couple of the other cheerleaders were. Her face was much rounder than it had been twenty minutes ago, with a thick double chin and jowls. Her body had become wider, with her tummy and her upper arms jiggling with excess fat. Her posterior was now soft, lush, and did the rumba when she walked. Overall, she looked like she had been well fed, the only positive being her now much larger breasts. But that wasn&#39;t all.<br />
<br />
Her formerly well kept long brunette hair was now a short bob cut, and was dyed blonde. Her roots were just beginning to show, which made Emily a tad self conscious, though she didn&#39;t know why.<br />
<br />
She now seemed to possess poorer eyesight. She was wearing a pair of admittedly cute black cat eye glasses on her face, but when she took them off, everything near and far seemed to blur, so Emily put them back on.<br />
<br />
She could still make out traces of her original self. Her blue grey eyes continued to twinkle mischievously, and the cheerleader could recognize her telltale smile from anywhere, but overall, she was virtually unrecognizable. She could pass for any random stay at home mom on her block.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Eve?&quot; she asked with a distinct dread in her voice, turning around to face her sulking friend.<br />
<br />
Her friend, sitting on a closed toilet, very slowly raised her face to look at Emily with her deep set, piggish looking eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve, where did you get that piece of jewelry from?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Willow Strasserman, who had been unaffected by the wish, had quietly snuck away from the scene through a side exit, both upset and deeply, deeply confused by what happened tonight. The geeky blonde could barely believe her own eyes. Had all of the girls really aged forty years right in front of her? She couldn&#39;t wait to tell Paige the news.<br />
<br />
Standing silently, her arms crossed underneath her cleavage, was a now middle aged Joanna Ingerman.<br />
<br />
All things considered, Joanna had gotten off the easiest. She was clearly a middle aged woman, just like the rest of her team, but she was still incredibly beautiful for her age, and more importantly, she had seen Eve run off with that weird looking gemstone. She knew that bitch had something to do with this, and she was going to make her pay for it.</p>
