<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric became confused about the sudden changes that were happening to his body. Then he remembered that the same thing was happening to Peter, when his calves suddenly started to grow. What was going on? But Peter didn’t seem too worried about the changes, so Eric picked up the phone and decided to give Peter a call.<br />
<br />
“Yo, Peter!”<br />
<br />
“Hey Eric, I just got home! I still need to gather the resources for our article for the newsletter…” Peter replied, thinking that Eric called up for the newsletter.<br />
<br />
“Peter, something weird is going on here… I feel weird… Could you come over?” Eric asked him, feeling deeply concerned.<br />
<br />
“Why? What’s wrong?” Peter asked.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure… My body just feels different… Ever since we came from the meeting at school… Could you come over now?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, I’ll be right there!”<br />
<br />
No sooner had Eric hung up the receiver of the phone when the doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
“Wow, he’s fast!” Eric thought to himself, as he ran down the stairs, down the hall, towards the front door. He opened it and found Peter standing at the door.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on, dude? Why are you so worried?” Peter wondered.<br />
<br />
“Come upstairs to my room for a sec…” Eric instructed Peter. The boys ran back up the stairs into Eric’s bedroom, where he immediately closed and locked the door.<br />
<br />
“Look at me, Peter! Do I look any different to you?” Eric asked him, almost in panic.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you’re taller! Good for you!” Peter smiled back.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on? My parents are gonna FREAK when they see that I suddenly grew 3 inches in one day! Who’s doing this to me? What’s happening to me?” Eric pleaded with Peter, who just stared at him with a grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“Oh I bet it’s my cousin. He’s probably bored and has nothing to do… He’s just playing with your body… Don’t worry, Eric! I’ve gotten used to it by now!” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
“I thought it was Allen who was doing it!”<br />
<br />
“No, Allen only has the power to transform me, nobody else. So if someone’s changing you, then it’s probably me, or Ty! If I start to grow, then it’s most likely Allen doing it. We’re on the swim team and he makes me grow all the time!” Peter responded.<br />
<br />
“What? You guys are so weird!” Eric responded, almost in anger.<br />
<br />
“Eric, I have the same powers as my cousin, do you know that?” Peter said, as he folded his arms in front of his chest.<br />
<br />
“No way! You’re joking…”<br />
<br />
“We should hang out; you should spend an afternoon with me, then you’ll see!” Peter chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Oh Peter, quit pulling my leg!”<br />
<br />
“Alrighty then! Go sit down on the bean bag over there!” Peter ordered. Immediately an invisible force pushed Eric backwards, making him fall in the bean bag, which was in the corner of his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Peter then quietly walked over to Eric and grabbed hold of his right leg by the ankle. Suddenly, the leg became detached from the rest of Eric’s body, and Peter was holding his leg in his hand!<br />
<br />
“What on Earth… MY LEG!! ARE YOU CRAZY?” Eric shouted in anger, he tried to get up but couldn’t, because he only had one leg.<br />
<br />
“Well you brought up the idea of pulling your leg, so I did!” Peter grinned, holding Eric’s detached leg in his hands.<br />
<br />
“Give me back my leg! PUT IT BACK!!” Eric shouted, almost crying tears from his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get so upset, I’ll put it back! Quit making such a fuss, dude…” Peter chuckled, as he bent down and reattached Eric’s leg to the bottom of his torso. “There, good as new!”<br />
<br />
“Peter, I thought Ty was weird… You’re MUCH WORSE! You are BEYOND WEIRD!”<br />
<br />
Then Peter reached back down and detached both of Eric’s arms from his shoulders! He set them on the ground, side-by-side, and he then detached his own left arm using his right arm, and attached it to Eric’s left shoulder.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?? ARE YOU MAD???” Eric began to shout. But Peter didn’t pay attention to him and continued to attach his own right arm to Eric’s right shoulder. Then he used his psychic power to levitate Eric’s arms and to attach them to Peter’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Dude, why are you so doggone skinny? Your arms are way too thin for me! Golly, you need some muscle! Just check out my arms… How do they feel on you?” Peter said calmly, as he moved around his new, thin arms.<br />
<br />
Eric began to calm down a bit and flexed the muscles on his new arms. Peter was more muscular than he was, so Eric suddenly felt the additional strength in his biceps.<br />
<br />
“Gosh… This is cool… But so weird…” Eric said, as he was staring at his new, muscular arms in wonder, taking turns flexing the big biceps he never had.<br />
<br />
“You like my arms? Do you want to keep them?” Peter asked him, much to Eric’s surprise.<br />
<br />
“Well, I would rather have my own arms back… Could you make my muscles grow bigger, instead?”<br />
<br />
“Sure. Let’s swap arms again…” peter replied calmly, as he stood before Eric, who was still sitting in the bean bag.<br />
<br />
Peter bent down and gently detached Eric’s arms, and then he removed his own arms and attached them to Eric’s shoulders. Eric now had his own arms back, while Peter used his psychic abilities to reattach his own arms back to his shoulders as well.<br />
<br />
“See? That wasn’t so bad, was it? I can do many more tricks when we…” Peter began to explain, until he suddenly stopped in the middle of the sentence.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” Eric wondered, noticing that Peter was feeling something strange happening to his body.<br />
<br />
“I feel something… Like I’m gonna grow…” Peter said, as he stood straight up, closing his eyes. Suddenly his legs and his torso grew about 7 inches taller, making him grow to a height of 6 feet and 10 inches! “Aaaaahhhhh….” He said, while the growth spurt took place, making him even taller than he was before.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Eric, I suddenly had a growth spurt… I had to grow a little… No big deal, this happens to me every day!” Peter said feeling relieved that the spurt was over.<br />
<br />
Eric immediately got up from the bean bag and stood right in front of Peter. Eric was still 5’7” while Peter was now 6’10” tall.<br />
<br />
“Holy crap! You’re so tall! You grew like 6 inches in only a few seconds! Who did that? Ty?” Eric wondered.<br />
<br />
“That was probably Allen… He can make my body shrink or grow… But I bet you that Ty and Allen are hanging out together somewhere, because those two are really good friends. And Allen likes to change me all the time, like every day!”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t that drive you nuts? He has complete control over your body!” Eric wondered.<br />
<br />
“I’ve kinda gotten used to it by now. Allen is always growing my muscles… I will grow when he just even thinks about muscle! Every time he goes to the gym, I suffer a massive growth spurt because of him!” Peter replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
“You’re SO WEIRD, Peter! Golly, you’re strange…” Eric said, while rolling his eyes in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Eric! Let’s go shoot some baskets, dude. Time to go out and have some fun…” Peter smiled, as he snapped his fingers, allowing his Dockers, jeans and sweater to be transformed into basketball shorts, jersey, and high tops on his feet!<br />
<br />
“Wait, Peter… I gotta change!” Eric complained, as he grabbed his clothes out of the closet.<br />
<br />
“Why wait?” Peter said, snapping his fingers. In an instant, Eric was wearing his t-shirt, shorts, and high tops as well! He was now fully dressed and ready to play basketball.<br />
<br />
Then Peter grabbed hold of Eric by the shoulder and he snapped his fingers again, instantly teleporting Eric and himself to the basketball court at the park where Ty and Allen were sitting.<br />
<br />
“Ty! They’re here! They’re on the basketball court behind us!” Allen said to Ty. Both boys turned around and smiled when they saw their two favorite victims shooting baskets on the court.<br />
<br />
“Good! Now we can watch them up close. Look, others are about to join them! Let’s wait till more guys show up, then you can work on Peter while I work on Eric, got that?” Ty responded.<br />
<br />
“Roger that, Ty! Ahhhhh I can’t wait to grow Peter some more… I LOVE this!” Allen said, while rubbing the palms of his hands together.<br />
<br />
Peter and Eric started off shooting some baskets when Peter suddenly grabbed hold of the ball and didn’t let go of it.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, what’s up? Pass the ball!” Eric shouted at him.<br />
<br />
“Wait, I just got an idea for a cool, new way to play basketball…” Peter said, as he was looking up at the sky, pondering his next move.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?”<br />
<br />
“I know of one way I could easily be the best basketball player around! I’ll just grow an extra leg in the middle!” Peter chuckled. Suddenly Peter just stood still, spreading his long, muscular legs out. All of the sudden a stump began to grow under his waist, just in between the two legs. The stump grew longer as a third leg began to form, containing the same muscular definition that his other two legs had. The third leg also had quads and a thick calf muscle, matching those on the other two legs. Suddenly Peter stood before him, standing on three legs with three feet. His middle leg had 7 toes on it, and Peter wished for it to have a white sock and another high top on the foot. When the third leg was all complete, he was ready to play as he started dribbling the ball.<br />
<br />
“Oh, no way… You got THREE LEGS!” Eric shouted at him. At first Eric thought that Peter had lost his mind, however he quickly changed his mind about Peter when other players started showing up and a small pick up game had started.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Eric. Everybody here thinks it’s normal for me to play with three legs!” Peter assured Eric, just before they started.<br />
<br />
Once the game got underway, Eric saw why Peter wanted to have three legs. The other players couldn’t knock him down, because he always had the third leg to give him additional support. Not only that, but Peter ran faster than the others, outscoring even the best player on the court by a long shot. When he got close to the hoop, Peter was able to jump considerably higher than the others, always finding the easy basket while hovering above the rest due to his three powerful legs.<br />
<br />
When Peter sensed that Eric also wanted a piece of the action, Peter walked off the court and allowed Eric to grow a third leg as well. Once Eric’s leg was completed and he had an extra shoe and sock over his third foot, he played basketball with the same intensity as Peter, who was now watching the game from the bench.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ty and Allen were looking on from behind the bushes.<br />
<br />
“Ty, I thought you were weird… But your cousin is NUTS!” Allen said in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Well, now you have something else you can change about Peter! You can grow him additional arms and legs whenever you want to!” Ty grinned back.<br />
<br />
“What are you going to do about Eric?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, let’s wait for the basketball game to be over. Eric is still too skinny and too short, don’t you think?” Ty asked Allen.<br />
<br />
Once the game was over, Eric walked up to Peter, and the two dudes decided to walk back to Eric’s house. It was quite a sight, seeing two teenagers with three legs, walking down the street! When they finally got to Eric’s house, he made his final request to Peter.<br />
<br />
“Well, it was fun, but…” Eric said in a sad tone of voice, while looking down at his third leg.<br />
<br />
“What? Oh just keep the leg, Eric! No big deal!” Peter assured him.<br />
<br />
“But my family is going to FLIP when they see me walking in the house with three legs, Peter! You gotta hide it or something. Can’t you make it disappear?” Eric wondered, feeling sad that he had to get rid of the extra leg.<br />
<br />
“Eric… Eric! Don’t worry! Nobody will notice. When people see you, they’ll think it’s completely normal for you to have three leg, three feet, and seventeen toes! I’ll make it so you can keep the leg as long as you want. If you don’t want it anymore, then just tell me and I’ll make it disappear! Have fun with it, okay?” Peter replied, while grabbing hold of Eric’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much, Peter! I’m sorry about earlier; I’m sorry about calling you weird. Now that I seem weird too, it really doesn’t seem so bad after all. It’s kind of cool, being weird…” Eric replied feeling a little embarrassed.<br />
<br />
“Forget about it. We’re NOT weird, we’re just different! You’ll think about my next time you need to walk, run, or jump on those three legs of yours…” Peter said, as he turned around, ready to walk back home.<br />
<br />
Eric turned around and closed the door. Suddenly, he began to feel a strange, warm, tingling feeling all over his body.<br />
<br />
“You’re still too short and too weak, Eric! I guess I’ll need to take care of that for you!” Ty’s voice thundered in Eric’s ears. Eric gasped as he looked down, for he noticed that his muscles began to grow, as his legs and torso began to grow longer. How tall and muscular was Ty going to make him now?<br />
<br />
Just as Peter began to stroll back to his house, he was frozen dead in his tracks. Allen was about to change him again! He closed his eyes as he anticipated another muscle growth spurt, thanks to his buddy Allen…</p>
