<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I-I...uhh, Ethan...wow...you&#39;re so much more built when I...I get a good look at you.&quot; Carl blushed as he looked at Ethan&#39;s solid chest. It was like touching a granite statue with how solid Ethan was. He wondered how much this guy had to workout back in high school originally, and how the vaunted health improving effects of the Chronos Virus even further must have muscled him up. Carl for his part blushed - he was so eager to please he had barely noticed that Ethan was liking what he&#39;d been doing. His hand felt more of that pectoral - feeling how it was just that solid. That strong - and then Ethan moaned when his eager hand trailed over his nipple. This brought everything Carl felt regarding Thomas right to the surface...was...was something like THIS what Carl wanted to be doing with Thomas? Having sex with him and Melissa at the same time...?<br />
<br />
While the make out continued, the clothes went off. Before long, both Ethan and Carl were in their underwear - and even that got taken off before long. Carl found himself almost too distracted by the athletic, hard body of Melissa and the powerfully built, muscled physique of Ethan. His cock bobbed with interest. Ethan&#39;s own was soooo big...<br />
<br />
Ethan looked his boss in the eye, blushing a little himself. &quot;This...is my first time doing something like this.&quot; His own hand trailed over Carl&#39;s smooth yet very tightly toned body. He was very evidently a swimmer - no body hair, all muscle tone and not much size. Ethan realized as his cock pulsed that he could probably do a lot of things then and there. A lot of very gay things. He paused, looking at Carl, wanting to say something. To ask what was appropriate next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now boys...&quot; Melissa said as she enjoyed the feeling of two young men in the heat of passion both touching each other and touching her, &quot;Kiss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan and Carl glanced at one another as they heard that verbal command. They wondered who would start it, the incredibly muscled, tall and rippling Ethan? Or the smaller, eager and toned Carl? After a moment&#39;s paralysis, Ethan decided nothing ventured nothing gained. And he didn&#39;t want Melissa to think he was a wet blanket in her threesome plans. So Ethan moved forward and planted a hot, passionate kiss on Carl&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
He half expected Carl to resist.<br />
<br />
To fight back or complain or refer to this as too much too fast.<br />
<br />
What Ethan didn&#39;t expect was Carl leaning very heavily into it and passionately kissing him back. Was Carl...bi already? Ethan didn&#39;t have much time to contemplate that as Carl&#39;s kiss continued in its urgency, and Ethan had to admit he was a damn good kisser. He was feeling his cock, which had flagged a little bit from the shock of what Melissa wanted him to do, surge back up to a good erection. When he felt Carl pull closer even as they continued touching Melissa, who rested between them, Ethan went ahead, reached around, and pulled Carl&#39;s chest closer to his own and started kissing the man back in earnest.<br />
<br />
&quot;My ohhh my! You two are improving so much so fast!&quot; Melissa went in and received a kiss from each - Ethan and Carl eagerly planting a similarly hot kiss on her lips before starting to press up against one another again. Ethan&#39;s chest was soooo big and strong. Carl loved the feeling - he never knew he had these bisexual inclinations lurking somewhere in him. But he definitely didn&#39;t regret acting on them with Ethan. Ohh fuck, Ethan was so big, Melissa was so soft...Carl was just melting into the passion of it.<br />
<br />
Ethan for his part started moving and Melissa giggled and stepped back to watch, letting her own hands move to touch Ethan&#39;s ass as Ethan pressed Carl against the table - grinding their bodies together. &quot;Fuck, man,&quot; Ethan said as he pulled back a bit, &quot;Look at us! We&#39;re really making out like...like gay college kids.&quot; Ethan let out a long moan as he felt Carl&#39;s hand cup his manhood, and he took joy when he heard Carl yelp when his own hand groped Carl&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Carl tried to register a protest, &quot;Too sensitive! Too sensitive! Don&#39;t just...go grabbing my dick...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You grabbed mine, it&#39;s fair game,&quot; Ethan responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;He has a point,&quot; Melissa said as she leaned in and kissed Carl on the lips. She was really enjoying the show. Much as many young men in their horny moments enjoyed watching two lesbians making out, Melissa and many women like her enjoyed the sight of two men enjoying each others&#39; presence. Something about the collision of two muscled hunks and the clash of the male egos as they sorted out who&#39;d be on top...oh! And that reminded her!<br />
<br />
She started to move toward the floor, beckoning the boys to join her. Ethan glanced at Carl, who simply kissed him again and tried to get him to stop touching his dick too much - a little was fine, but simply rubbing it that intense... it&#39;d make him cum too soon! Carl knew his new body well enough now to know when such things were beyond his endurance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ethan said as he got up, getting ready to engage with Melissa, &quot;Seems the lady wants a bit of sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I do,&quot; Melissa said with a grin, &quot;But remember Ethan, there are three of us here. Carl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; He answered, eagerly joining them as they got ready for the penetrative phase of the threesome. Carl was unexpectedly having a blast doing this. He never once thought before about trying to get with his employees. Not the least because of his advanced age. But now, with his body this young and ready to go? He was actually thinking of reevaluating the workplace fraternization policies. &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck Ethan up his ass, while he fucks my pussy.&quot; This made Ethan and Carl look at each other with bewildered expressions. Ethan for his part had been willing to kiss Carl, make out with him hot and heavy, even touch his dick. But getting fucked? He felt a last bit of resistance muster itself...which Melissa picked up on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid! Carl&#39;s going to handle himself well, aren&#39;t you Carl?&quot; Melissa looked at Carl, who was now beaming and anticipating what doing that with Ethan would feel like. He&#39;d never had a guy before. He almost felt like, through sheer excitement, he might just lose control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! Yeah don&#39;t worry, man, I&#39;ll take you nice and gentle.&quot; Carl reassured him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus, haven&#39;t you ever wondered what the male G-Spot getting stimulated feels like?&quot; Melissa whispered to Ethan, which made his dick twitch. A kind of pleasure he hadn&#39;t had before...sounded like some fun. Even if he had to countenance the idea of a guy fucking him, he WAS still going to be able to fuck Melissa at the same time. Ethan looked at his dick, and watched Melissa sit down on the floor, spreading her legs.<br />
<br />
Ethan got ready, and gulped, making sure he was not tense before moving to start. He was however anticipating how this would feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here I go!&quot; Carl started lining himself up. Lubing his cock up a bit and then moving in. Ethan&#39;s ass as with the rest of him was a finely muscled bubble butt, and for Carl&#39;s newly awakened Bi side, he couldn&#39;t help but wonder how this would feel. He started easing it in, and Ethan grunted, and then quickly started to moan - the sensation of having a guy inside of him while he was inside of a woman was...oh! It was stupendous!<br />
<br />
Ethan didn&#39;t even anticipate that it would feel good...let alone how it started to feel when Carl began thrusting. Ethan had to keep the pace with the rhythm. He was sweating now - feeling so incredibly good!</p>
