<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unsure what to do next, Jennifer opted to avoid a fight with her mother. As uncomfortable as she was, it would <br />
be far worse to get into a huge fight with her mom and have to explain everything that was taking place. She <br />
nodded to her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you in the car, sweety,&quot; her mom said, and left the room.<br />
<br />
Jen gathered up her things from the bedroom vanity, looking once more at herself in the mirror as a sense of <br />
dread overshadowed the day ahead.<br />
<br />
Her huge breasts put her a little off balance, even more than they had immediately after the transformation. <br />
She noticed that they felt very heavy, and felt as if they were filling up. She twisted at the waist to look <br />
at them in profile, experimentally lifting up a breast with her hand through the fabric of her sweater. <br />
<br />
The breast was definitely heavier and hardly as springy-soft as she was used to. It grew even more rigid as <br />
she held it - she could feel through her fingers that it was definitely engorging with some kind of fluid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap,&quot; she thought, remembering Kyle's phone call. Her breasts were filling themselves with sperm.<br />
<br />
With no time to explore further, she dashed out the door, school tote in hand, and went down to the car.<br />
<br />
Most mornings, it was incredibly convenient for Jen that her mom worked as an office manager in a business <br />
park just a few blocks from her school, since it meant she never once had to take the bus. However, the curse <br />
on her body -- and what could happen because of it -- filled all her thoughts this morning. <br />
<br />
She sat curled up in the passenger seat, as withdrawn as possible, and avoided her mom's usual cheery attempts <br />
at conversation as the morning drive passed slowly by. Her mom naturally suspected something more serious than <br />
usual was wrong, but Jennifer kept it to herself, not least because she had no idea what she would say about <br />
it.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they arrived at school and Jennifer got out. Her mom waved and Jen returned it half-heartedly as <br />
she made her way towards the entrance. <br />
<br />
She just hoped she could make it to class without anyone noticing her. Strangely enough to her, no one seemed <br />
to pay any more attention than usual. She did notice a few cowardly boys stealing glances at her chest, but <br />
they quickly avoided eye contact and pretended nothing happened. She realized that it was probably because her <br />
boobs were simply very big, and not because they happened to be bigger today.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her best friend Kirsten hurried up beside her, books in hand. Kirsten was dressed in her usual <br />
fashion-forward way, with a nice white button-up blouse, an A-line skirt and an assortment of silver jewelry <br />
that pulled everything together, though a pair of carefully matched retro sneakers and socks kept the look <br />
flirty and young. The ensemble played up her slender figure's curves while only pretending to reveal too much.<br />
<br />
Jen hated her for a moment for looking so put together on a day when she felt like a freak in an over-sized <br />
sweater, but was glad to see her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there,&quot; Kirsten said. &quot;How's it going? You are not gonna believe what just happened! Mike just asked me <br />
out! I can't believe it! He's been acting like I don't exist for weeks and I finally... hey, what's wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
They stopped. Jennifer looked at Kirsten, who knew her better than anyone. She hesitated, but the desire to <br />
tell -someone- about what happened was overwhelming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kirsten, you know that 'transform or dare' curse?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah -- that's, like, the only urban legend Glendale has to show for itself. Why?&quot; Kirsten replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that guy we pants'd last week? Kyle, that little dork with that stupid ski vest? He gave me the <br />
curse,&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; Kirsten said. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen turned her chest towards Kirsten and rolled her shoulders back to display them, and opened her mouth, <br />
letting the head of her cock slide out a few inches. Kirsten only looked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kirsten asked. &quot;What am I supposed to be seeing? You look the same as you always have. I mean, I know <br />
your cock-tongue thing is a little wierd -- I'm sorry, no offense -- but, you know? I mean, it's normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this isn't normal! I wasn't like this even last night! Kyle made this happen with that curse! I'm so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirsten looked at her in disbelief. &quot;Sorry, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Jennifer felt a flood of pleasure rising from her chest, up through her throat and into her cock-<br />
tongue. Her lips parted and its entire length pushed itself out from her mouth. Jen's eyes widened as she <br />
watched her member stiffen into a full and impressive erection. The tip twitched, and her cock grew another <br />
inch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohm my gothm...!&quot; Jen said, suddenly unable to speak clearly. Part of her was horrified, but she hadn't felt <br />
anything remotely as pleasurable in her life. If she had still been able to breathe, she would have been <br />
panting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen?&quot; Kirsten asked again, unaware of that condition of the curse. Kyle had said that if anyone said Jen's <br />
name, her cock would stiffen up and grow another inch.<br />
<br />
Jen's cock spasmed again, and pushed itself out further as it grew again for a moment. Another wave of <br />
pleasure came over her. It was like the nice feeling she had after getting horny in class, but this was vastly <br />
more intense and it encompassed her whole head and chest. It was impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hafth to doth thomething,&quot; Jen mustered.<br />
<br />
She reached up and wrapped her fingers around the shaft, meaning to shove it back before anyone noticed. This <br />
time it was totally unyielding as she tried to push it back inside her mouth.<br />
<br />
However, it felt unbelievably good as she touched it.<br />
<br />
It was literally feeding her more of the warm, pleasurable feeling -- she could feel the sensation pass <br />
through her mouth and down her throat -- and she began to stroke her shaft in earnest.<br />
<br />
She'd given a hand job to an old boyfriend once, her hand hidden under a coat on his lap during a movie, but <br />
she'd had no idea that it felt -this- good to be the receiver. She was quickly lost.<br />
<br />
She tugged firmly on the loose skin, working her hands up and down the length. She worked the web of her hand <br />
around the head, pushed her fingers into the softer underside, and let the foreskin work back and forth as she <br />
moved her hands up and down. A tear of pre-cum the size of a marble formed on the tip, and she slathered it <br />
across the cock. It got even better, so she stroked faster.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long before she felt a rising sensation in her chest, and it was sharper and far more intense <br />
than anything she'd ever experienced with her pussy. She moaned as her breasts suddenly tightened, and Jen <br />
came with a force and a wave of pleasure that she was unprepared for. A gout of cum exploded from her dick <br />
with a little squirty pop and splashed audibly onto the ground.<br />
<br />
It didn't stop. She felt unfamiliar muscles, deep in her throat, pumping hard in rapid waves, shooting jets of <br />
the milky fluid through her shaft and out into the air. She watched through half-closed eyes, reeling in <br />
sensation, as the pressure spent the contents of her cum-filled breasts across yards of pavement and grass.<br />
<br />
Almost a dozen pumps later, the pressure subsided and the feeling ebbed away. Her breasts felt slightly sore, <br />
but they were also much lighter and greatly relieved. Her dick started to soften, shrinking visibly as it did <br />
so, and in twenty seconds or so it had shrunk enough to return itself to her mouth.<br />
<br />
Kirsten, who'd watched the whole thing, eyed Jen with a vacant and somewhat hungry look that Jen was unused to <br />
seeing from another girl, much less her best friend. As the wash of endorphin at last disappeared, Jen began <br />
to feel embarrassed by it, and what had happened.<br />
<br />
The evidence was all around. Long splatters of cum mess coated the sidewalk and school yard across a fifteen <br />
foot arc in front of Jen. Incredibly, she'd avoided getting any on Kirsten, though some of it had landed mere <br />
inches from her friend's sneaker-clad ankle.<br />
<br />
As Jen's head cleared further, she looked around, expecting someone to catch her. But, except for Kirsten, it <br />
was clear that no one else had really noticed her fireworks.<br />
<br />
The bell rang. She had only a few minutes left to get to class. She...</p>
