<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You watched in silent horror as your mother picked you up, confused why she wasn&#39;t holding the real dildo, you saw she instead has the medallion in her other hand. In a flash it had vanished as she activated it, but you saw no change in her, instead you felt a tingle rush through you and realized She was using the medallion to change the object in her hand, which was you. Your long rubbery form shrank, bulging out as she made you more spherical. You felt your insides changing as well, mechanical devices filling where there had been simple rubber. <br />
<br />
You happened to be within eyesight of your mothers vanity mirror, so you could see your body change from a large dildo, into what looked like one of those discreet vibrating egg toys. Why had your mother changed you into another sex toy, you wondered, though her next words filled you with terror.<br />
&quot;There, no way I will mistake you for my son now.~&quot; She said with a chuckle, while being scared on what she done. She thought the other dildo was you and had changed her real dildo into an egg, she had no idea she had done it to you, her own son! Her fingers brushed at a little rubber covered button on your base, with a faint click you began to vibrate with a low whirring sound, the inner working making your whole body vibrate in pulses. She bit her bottom lip, and your view of yourself vanished as she began to lower you below the mirror.<br />
<br />
It did not take you long to realize what she was doing as you screamed in silent horror, mentally crying out to your mother that she had made a mistake, but it made no difference. The only sound that escaped you was the quiet vibrations that one would hear from any other vibrating egg toy. Other than a sentient mind, you were the real thing.<br />
<br />
The outside world slowly vanished as you felt warm, wet flesh press tightly around you, before you only saw darkness as she slipped you inside herself. Her muscles tensed and contorted to your vibrations, her sex already wet and lubricated and getting more so by the second. You tried to block all this out with very little success, while your mother simply let put a content sound, slipped her panties back up over her crotch and got ready for bed. She planned to keep her little toy in, so she could keep herself occupied in bed. She glanced over at the solid looking wall, chuckling as she knew her son was hidden in the secret wall safe only she knew about. She had even wrapped him in a cloth so he couldn&#39;t see her open it.<br />
<br />
By the time she got into bed, she had to change into another pair of panties as these were soaked through, so she simply tossed them in the dirty hamper and slipped on a new pair before climbing under the covers. The egg was on a random pulse setting and it was very enjoyable how it teased, got her close and faded off, but she was getting closer and closer with every pulse cycle. She had to bite her lip to keep from crying out, not wanting her kids to hear her through the walls. Little did she know that her fun new toy was one of those kids who was very much aware of her building arousal. <br />
<br />
There was a sudden clenching around you before a flood of juices as your mother orgasmed, pouring over you like floodwaters. Her orgasm actually pushed you out partially, the bottom of you slipping as if she was about to lay an egg, but the panties held you in place. After she recovered, you felt her hand reach in and grab at you, turning you off with the click of the button and held you up to her flushed but satisfied face. She wiped you down with a chuckle and said, &quot;Mmmm, that was wonderful. Heh, I might even take you to work tomorrow!~&quot; She cooed, before placing you down on the bedside table. Her needs satisfied, she pulled the covers up and snuggled up to sleep, leaving your mentally traumatized egg shaped body resting on the bedside table, watching her drift off. She was going to use you again in the morning? With how long your punishment was meant to be, who knows how many times you would be used before she realized the mix up? <br />
<br />
You stood there on the bedside table, unable to sleep, trying with all your might to force the morning not to come, you did not want to go through that again, but despite your efforts, eventually you saw the morning sunlight begin to creep through the window from behind the curtain. Your mothers alarm went off, deafeningly loudly next to your little body before her hand reached over, knocking you off the table as she sleepily reached for the off button to her alarm, you hit the floor and rolled slightly under the bed. A brief hope of being lost under here until your punishment was up welled inside you, but your mothers hand reached down and picked you up a few moments later. &quot;Whoops, don&#39;t want to lose my new favorite toy.~&quot; She said with a chuckle, and a yawn before placing you back on the side and stood up, walking into her bathroom and leaving you with a defeated feeling. <br />
<br />
You listened to her shower start up and knew sooner or later, you were going to be reunited with your mother in a far too intimate way, but as an inanimate object, you couldn&#39;t do anything to change what was going to happen. All you could do was hope your sister brought up her planned switch, and reveal the mix up sooner rather than later. You barely were focused on the world around you, lost in your panicked thoughts as your mother finished her shower, coming back into the room in a towel, drying her hair, putting on her clothes and heading downstairs to make breakfast. <br />
<br />
You were left alone in the room while your mother, and sister both ate breakfast like real people. The medallion had finished its timer and Belle asked if she could use it, so it had been passed to her as your mother couldn&#39;t use it again now until someone else used it anyway, which meant only Belle as you wouldn&#39;t be allowed to use it until your punishment was over. They chatted about a few subjects, Belle still embarrassed about being caught the night before, but does she bring the subject up? Is the mix up revealed?</p>
