<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate groaned at her luck. after buying some gifts for her family her car wouldn&#39;t start. the man who came to fix it said it was a mechanical issue. &quot;so I&#39;m gonna have to take it to the repair shop and take a look at it. with how late it is I&#39;ll try to get it back to you tomorrow&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
snow began to fall all of a sudden. &quot;*sigh* i understand. I don&#39;t live too far away from here I&#39;ll just head back.&quot; after getting their information exchanged Kate grabbed her two bags and purse and headed back home. thankfully her house was only 2 miles away.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing I bundled up just in case,&quot; she said. the main obstacle between her and home was the Blueton park. the park itself wasn&#39;t wider than 2 miles however it opened up into the lupus woods. it was short for canis lupus aka wolves. As she walked down the path the snowstorm got worse.  <br />
<br />
&#39;maybe I should call Steven and...&#39; she was snapped out of her thoughts by a howl. while hearing a howl in the park wasn&#39;t uncommon the beasts rarely ventured this close to the city. dropping her phone in surprise she looked down. the poor device was already on its last legs. picking it up showed a destroyed screen showing the inner circuitry.  <br />
<br />
&quot;of course, it has to fall screen down&quot; she groaned as she was left with no further option than to go forward. she jumped when the lamps around the path went out. the only light to be faint traces of orange glow within the storm itself. the ground soon became covered in snow. it was now impossible to see the path before her.  <br />
<br />
She had already gone a mile in. so she begrudgingly continued walking. a howl could be heard now and then. each time sounding closer and closer. Kate began to move faster and away from the noise.  <br />
<br />
her adrenaline now making her warmer. However, she soon found herself running into a bench under a tree. she recognized it as being further into the park. &quot;shoot I&#39;ve been going the wrong way,&quot; she spoke aloud. her breath leaving white clouds from her mouth.  <br />
<br />
what she didn&#39;t know was the snowstorm was only in the park. a howl could be heard as she got up. turning around she saw two sets of eyes glaring through the shifting white wind. both growled in hunger as she backed up. the beast was twice her size. her flight or fight instincts kicked in and she ran.  <br />
<br />
the beast seemed amused as it ran as well. it purposely kept itself from catching up as it wanted her to tire out. after a  bit, Kate saw salvation. a public bathroom next to the playground. She grabbed the handle only to find it locked.  <br />
<br />
She realized too late that they don&#39;t open these in cold weather. she ran blindly toward the playground. She was soon jumped by the beast. it turned her around so they could make eye contact. It was a two-headed humanoid wolf. while one head looked at her the other one looked at the presents.  <br />
<br />
the left head then spoke. &quot;do not worry little one. I mean you no harm. I have been given a gift,&quot; Its voice contained a deep growl as it spoke. I shared the gift with a poor homeless man who would&#39;ve died without my help.&quot; it smiled as the right head spoke. &quot;now he and I are one. a shared mind. our mental sickness gone&quot; they then spoke in unison. &quot;we aim for one more. choose little one. the storm has zapped your strength. the cold has pierced your clothing. which will it be trapped in a snowstorm getting more lost until you freeze to death or...&quot; the left stopped speaking as the right took over. &quot;...or join us and see your loved ones&quot;.   <br />
<br />
it then rose revealing his cock rock hard in anticipation. he then walked back to the swings and sat down. how such a piece of playground equipment could hold him was beyond her. however, it was true what it said. she couldn&#39;t run anymore. her legs were hurting too much.  <br />
<br />
not to mention she seemed to be going further in no matter which way she turned. She shivered as her adrenaline faded. her fingers and lips turning blue from the cold. she tried to speak. &quot;will I still be me?&quot; she stuttered every word.  <br />
<br />
The two heads spoke in unison. &quot;yes and more. You will have the instincts of a wolf and the knowledge of man&quot; he said. the head&#39;s smirks were hidden in the snowstorm. they knew she had no choice.  <br />
<br />
rather than forcing her physically, they manipulated her. however, if she had chosen to not accept they would have simply returned her to the park entrance. they had no interest in killing her. seeing her nod her head as her eyes became droopy was all they needed. the snow that hung on their gray fur turned into orange energy.   <br />
<br />
the same happened to Kate. She was suddenly awakened by a warm tingling sensation. looking down she gasped as her clothes were dissolved by the glow. before the glow could fade completely the wolf grabbed her and turned her around. her pussy was now right over the red rocket the beast had.  <br />
<br />
the instant her body touched his purple goop began to leach out of his body and cover hers. her legs and right hand were quickly absorbed. as soon as they were inside the beast she could feel his body. She could feel his hand reach for his cock as her pelvis was absorbed. She could now feel his canine cock begging for need.  <br />
<br />
soon most of her torso was absorbed. his body expanded larger in width. As soon as the goop was done it sunk back into its body. the two heads rubbed against Kate&#39;s head as their skin and fur became goop. soon her raining boob and arm were sucked in as they grabbed their cock.  <br />
<br />
pulling back the two heads regained their skin and fur. Kate on the other hand was different. her head became more and more like the other two as they pulled. her eyes are now black with yellow irises like the right head. the left was mostly yellow with black pupils.  <br />
<br />
her mind soon gained new information as he had said. the wolf&#39;s memories were first. being separated from his pack the glow surrounded him. he then sought out someone to talk to. the first person he came across was a man in his forties.  <br />
<br />
the man looked on the brink of death. the wolf with his new knowledge couldn&#39;t bear for the first person her met to die. As if to answer the glow returned as the man&#39;s clothes dissolved. the wolf approached the man and felt his body becoming purple goop. he quickly covered the man.  <br />
<br />
once he was finished the two minds now shared everything. the man was Lance a veteran who developed a phobia of the indoors as well as several other problems. the two then heard her and approached. they had felt incomplete. it was almost like they needed a third head.  <br />
<br />
the left head was the most instinctive of the two. the right one was the most skillful of them. however, they realized what they needed was what she had. morality was one of the things Kate was best at. he smiled as he was now an identical head.  <br />
<br />
his fears are now gone thanks to the others. he felt the familiar sensation of his cock releasing its load on the snow. looking down they studied themselves. no wait, he studied himself. they were three parts of one mind.  <br />
<br />
the muscles of his body had grown. he now had a muscular v shape to his torso. his tail wagged as he looked at his wolf-like legs. he approached the gifts the middle had gotten for his kids. The three had decided that Kate or Kevin as he now would be known, would be the leader for now.   <br />
<br />
Lance instructed him on how to move his male parts and the wolf would instruct on his wolf parts. As they picked up their gifts the right and middle felt off just calling left wolf. left agreed and wanted to be called Fang from now on. he also decided on what people would call him as a whole. &quot;we are La-fan-vin&quot; he said as he walked back to the path.  <br />
<br />
the snowstorm subsided before he found out its true purpose. &#39;I feel whole&#39; the three thought as they headed home. Kevin reached into his purse as they approached the house. a sudden realization that his key was in his pants pocket earlier came to him. knocking on his front door he heard a noise from within.  <br />
<br />
opening it revealed a large rabbit man. suddenly a glow covered the Cerberus anthro. &quot;hey Dad! You lost your keys?&quot; Sonny said. his new name coming to them. due to having three minds in one, their combined mentality was too strong for the magic to over right completely.  <br />
<br />
instinctively fang answered. &quot;yeah I was walking through the park a fell. Sadly it&#39;s probably long gone now&quot;. &#39;it seems whatever transformed us also transformed my kids&#39; he thought as they entered. he silently hoped that his husband was okay. behind him, he sniffed the scent of his husband but it was different. turning around he came face to face with...</p>
