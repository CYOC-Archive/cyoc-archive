<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was kind of hard not to shout about how she knew it all this time, but Alexandria was doing her best.<br />
<br />
Oh, people had thought she was a bit crazy for years. All the time she had spent suspecting that the government had some sort of special program dealing with the supernatural, and people had laughed at her. Her! An accomplished, respected field agent! She worked in the CIA, for Christ&#39;s sake, she knew damn well that some shady shit happened behind the scenes. <br />
<br />
Well, she was the one laughing now - literally, laughing with excitement as she prepared for the first day at her new assignment. It had been so difficult not to squeal during the briefing, as a top-tier government spook explained how she&#39;d been selected for a group that dealt with issues &#39;beyond conventional understanding&#39;. Shorthand for &#39;paranormal crap&#39;. And she was going to be part of it!<br />
<br />
With such an important new start to her life, she was taking a great deal of care in preparing herself. The thirty-two year old agent prided herself on staying in tip-top shape, a fine athletic specimen with a slender frame and great endurance. Lacking in the chest and posterior, perhaps, but a pretty face and silky, chocolate-colored hair made up for that. Said hair was tied into a neat bun, a professional arrangement that matched the black pant-suit she was wearing. She looked every bit the part of one of those men-in-black types - it seemed rather appropriate, given her new position.<br />
<br />
The trip to her new office saw her squirming on the packed subway training, giddy with anticipation. She had to stop herself from sprinting up the steps to the unassuming office building where she&#39;d be working, nestled among countless other government offices that packed DC&#39;s city blocks. The receptionist and plain-looking security guards failed to share her enthusiasm, simply waving her through after checking her ID, but that failed to dampen her excitement.<br />
<br />
Deep down, she had been expecting the interior, past all the security checkpoints, to be fantastical in some way - but it was as beige and plain as any government office. Cubicles all over the floor, people in business attire running around attending to their duties, all in all not that different from her old posting. She was spotted instantly by a dark-skinned man with streaks of gray in his hair, marching over to speak to her with a deep, baritone voice. &quot;Agent Kilmore, right? Senior Agent Hayes.&quot; He didn&#39;t even go for a handshake; the man looked exasperated, and waved for her to come along.<br />
<br />
She followed without question, of course, listening as he began to explain. &quot;I&#39;d give you the ten-cent tour, but we&#39;ve got a situation, and I need a field agent quick.&quot; He ran a hand down his face as he led the brunette down a stairway, leading deeper inside the facility. The offices rapidly gave way to a more laboratory-esque environment, with plenty of people in white lab coats joining the office drones and guards with considerably more firepower. &quot;Please tell me they gave you the briefing on what we do here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; She replied eagerly, &quot;They explained that Extraordinary Affairs deals with unusual threats to the United States, utilizing means not available to conventional agencies.&quot; She recited the line they&#39;d been fed in the briefing with great enthusiasm, but this only seemed to bring an exasperated sigh from Hayes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn beating around the bush again, aren&#39;t they,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Let me guess - they didn&#39;t tell you a damn thing about the Chimera Unit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her brow furrowed as they rounded a corner, heading into a circular room in which several technicians were attending to various computers and pieces of equipment. &quot;No sir,&quot; the young woman replied politely, though her gaze was rapidly drawn to a woman standing in the room. Average height, with olive skin and middle eastern facial features, dark hair that came down to her shoulders, and nothing but a hospital gown to cover her body. She was, admittedly, rather beautiful, though she seemed terribly annoyed at the moment.<br />
<br />
Hayes waved for man in scrubs to hurry over, pointing to Alexandria. &quot;Get her ready.&quot; His gaze shot to the arabic woman. &quot;She&#39;s green. Give her the quick rundown, I&#39;ve got five other fires to put out.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman raised an eyebrow but nodded, following Alexandria as she was led over to sit on a hospital bed.&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; she said, her voice pleasant, lightly accented. &quot;He&#39;s a good boss, but he can&#39;t get five minutes without a crisis to solve.&quot; She held out her hand. &quot;Agent Farah Jahandar. Welcome to the weirdest job you&#39;ll ever have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandria Kilmore... and thanks.&quot; She shook the woman&#39;s hand, but had to pull away quickly as the nurse began removing her garments. Odd, but she played along, letting them strip her down to her underwear. &quot;We&#39;re... going to be working together, I&#39;m assuming.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, stifling a giggle. &quot;Oh yes, we&#39;ll be working very, very closely.&quot; She smiled brightly as another woman began quickly strapping various things to Alexandria, despite her near-nudity. A heavy backpack, various pouches around her arms and legs, and even several firearms around her chest. &quot;Let me guess, he rushed you in here with no explanation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brunette nodded, and Farah sighed. &quot;That figures. We&#39;re a bit... short-handed, and this mission couldn&#39;t be delayed.&quot; As Alexandria was stood up, Farah reached over to a table and grabbed a small box, opening it to reveal a pair of rings. One silver, one gold; Farah took the gold ring, sliding it onto the finger, before taking Alexandria&#39;s hand and sliding the other one on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems a bit early to be proposing,&quot; Alexandria quipped. <br />
<br />
Farah simply gave her an ammused grin. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. We&#39;re about to get to know each other quite well, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Setting the box aside, she grasped Alexandria&#39;s hand, their fingers intertwining and the rings touching. Immediately, a soft white glow began to emanate from them, the intensity increasing rapidly as the brunette&#39;s green eyes stared in confusion. After a few moments, the glow abated, and a tingle began to pulse across her hand as she felt it... tugged, for lack of a better word, towards Farah&#39;s.<br />
<br />
She let out a gasp as she watched her fingers... melt, for lack of a better word. They seemed to become like putter, and Farah&#39;s hand did the same, the two masses pulling into each other, blending into a single blob of flesh. A jolt of excitement shot up her arm - something pleasant, even arousing, making her cheeks flush as she looked to meet Farah&#39;s gave in bewilderment. &quot;What... what&#39;s... what...&quot;<br />
<br />
The other woman put a hand on her bare shoulder, and instantly she felt the same bolt of excitement travel through her... and beyond her. She could feel it in Farah - she could feel everything the other woman was feeling, and it only increased her sense of arousal. &quot;First time always blows the mind,&quot; Farah said softly, her smile wider than ever. &quot;Relax. Just embrace it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leaning forward, she suddenly smashed her lips into Alexandria&#39;s, both women closing their eyes as tongues suddenly wrapped around each other. Just as with the hands, the flesh of their tongue and lips quickly began to merge, sealing and melting into each other. No longer able to contain herself, Alexandria let out a soft moan, her arms wrapping around Farah&#39;s back; instantly she could feel the skin fusing with the other woman&#39;s, their combined arousal forming an intense feedback loop of excitement.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t know how to process any of this, and right then, she didn&#39;t want to. All she cared about was drawing Farah in closer, leaning into the sensation of her body melting into the arabic beauty. The various bits and bobs she&#39;d been equipped with began to melt as well, joining into the mess as their closeness quickly rendered the pair a tall blob of blending flesh, moans, and stifled cries. Throats and tongues vanished into the miasma, but she could still feel - god, she could feel everything. Herself, Farah, they shared every feeling, and it drove her insane.<br />
<br />
The pleasure was orgasmic, but all she could do when the climax hit was shudder, her body now entirely unified with Farah&#39;s in a featureless pile on the ground. She could see or hear or smell nothing beyond their union, her entire existence composed of nothing but Farah and the bliss they shared. In that moment, she wanted nothing more than to remain in that state eternally, all cares and worries ripped away in favor of pure, unadulterated joy.<br />
<br />
Gradually, however, she felt their form begin to take shape, altered by the immense will of her partner. She could feel every little cell as the blob reshaped into something humanoid, a torso, head, arms and legs. Beautiful, dark brown hair flowed down, full lips and dark eyes forming on a beautifully-sculpted face. She looked into a mirror, finding the best features of both women combined into one gorgeous visage. With fascination she watched as her body took on definition, her old fitness becoming readily visible, but now matched with a considerable bust and rear end that perfectly suited her six-foot frame.<br />
<br />
<i>You still there, honey?</i><br />
<br />
Farah&#39;s voice rang in her head, without any lips moving. It occurred to her as she looked down that she wasn&#39;t controlling her own movements... but she could feel them. <i>I... think so...</i> She thought, wondering if Farah could hear her.<br />
<br />
<i>Good, good. It&#39;s always a bit overwhelming, the first time.</i> Her head - no, it was their head, wasn&#39;t it? - turned over towards one of the technicians. &quot;We&#39;re good.&quot; The voice sounded like a blend of both of theirs, the smokiness of Alexandria&#39;s with the light, pleasant accent of Farah&#39;s. &quot;Let Hayes know we&#39;re on the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mind felt light and heavy as she felt their combined body reaching down to grab some clothing from a chest under the hospital bed. Thankfully, Farah&#39;s voice within them returned to begin explaining things. <i>You and everything you were carrying has been... absorbed, basically, into my body.</i> They smirked. <i>Don&#39;t worry. Everything you are, your mind, your body, it&#39;s all still in here. Just repurposed, for a little bit.</i><br />
<br />
It was so utterly bizzare, but... it made some sense, she realized. Two agents in one incredible body; their pooled expertise would be on hand, without having to send in a second agent. <i>And if you need me to walk around, or if you need the kit they gave me...?</i><br />
<br />
The question was answered with a wave of pleasure washing over her, as she felt her arm suddenly split out from one of their combined arms. She could move it, waving the limb around, wriggling her fingers until it was pulled back in, to another crashing tsunami of arousal that rippled through their form. <i>Easy as pie,</i> Farah&#39;s voice said.<br />
<br />
Quickly they donned a suit not unlike Alexandria&#39;s, albeit with a skirt, dark stockings, and much more luxurious heels. It all felt incredible, seated upon their body - even as they walked out of the room, Alexandria was still on the border of being overwhelmed. Sensing this, Farah brought them to a stop next to a restroom, and she could feel a playfulness in the way the other woman addressed her. <i>We&#39;ve got a few minutes, if you&#39;d like to... explore our body.</i></p>
