<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly ty feels that he isn't handcuffed, he knows he isn't awake <br />
how he knows this well he doesn't know. He does know that this isn't a <br />
dream either, but that he doesn't really understand. <br />
<br />
He also knows that there is a voice here and it's speaking to him. The <br />
voice belongs to a boy with white hair dressed like some kind of <br />
gothic rockstar. The boy is cute, but not really his type he thinks <br />
absently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I resent that!&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh? You knew what I was thinking?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, kind of goes with semi-omnipotent you know semi-omniscient. <br />
The whole god gig thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, you're a god?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot;<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on!&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay the dealio is that I gave you the power. We call it the wishing <br />
gift. Something you should know though is that your power has ... well <br />
it's drawbacks.&quot;<br />
&quot;What kind of drawbacks?&quot;<br />
&quot;Me&quot; Suddenly ty can see the boy clearly, he has horns and red eyes <br />
and scars on his body. There are wings of flame behind him and he's <br />
carrying a scythe made of bones. <br />
&quot;What no!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I'm not all bad, but I am inevitable. You see your world <br />
is slowly crawling toward the end. That would be me by the way the god <br />
of ends and oblivion. You see when your world ends I'll be the one who <br />
collects it, call me the global grim reaper. So your power is one of <br />
those things that herald the end, the more you use it the faster that <br />
end will come. I hope you understand what I'm saying.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fuck no!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry no changing it, I mean honestly I don't like it either. I hope <br />
you fight it with all your might and trust me I'm going to give you <br />
the tools to do so. Unfortunately the wishing power doesn't work on me <br />
so you can't just wish me away.&quot;<br />
&quot;That sucks...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah I know, if it were that easy I would tell you to do just that.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you're really not a bad guy?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I think this sucks as much as you do, but I was created for <br />
this... I mean it's my nature I can't change who I am.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wow that really ... that really fucking sucks...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but anyway I can't tell you how to stop it straight out, but I <br />
can give you clues and tools.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay what's the first clue?&quot;<br />
&quot;I have a couple actually, the first is elements and history, you're <br />
people stopped me once before long long long ago. You have to find the <br />
13 constructs the lighthouses that stopped me before and the 13 <br />
elements and the okai tugra that can summon and light them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait ... okai tugra?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah 13 people each of a different race.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait there are humans, vampires, werewolves, centaurs, elves, satyrs, <br />
merpeople... that's 7 not 13.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't forget catgirls, and winged humans. Also the elves are three <br />
different races and the werewolves two.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, but that's 14.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah unfortunately I'm talking about the 13 original races that ruled <br />
your planet long ago.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh wait, shit you mean I already fragged it all up didn't I?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nope, luckily the okai tugra are immune well not completely, but <br />
partially from the wishing power as well. Although the races are gone <br />
they'll remain.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh thank god, what about the lighthouses?&quot;<br />
&quot;They aren't affected by the wishing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good, so what are the elements?&quot;<br />
&quot;Life, fire, shadow, earth, war, magic, light, wind, water, death, <br />
mind, love, and spirit.&quot;<br />
&quot;Cool, anything else I need to know?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well a lot actually now you better listen I won't repeat this and <br />
you'll wake up when I'm done.&quot;<br />
&quot;Shit okay I'm listening.&quot;<br />
