<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, it certainly is-colorful,” Kevin said as he and Sally walked into the room Mr. Beck had assigned them in the Clown Wing. <br />
<br />
If anything, that was an understatement. The walls of the roomed were striped and polka dotted, the ceiling and carpet were tie-dyed and swirled in an explosion of color that looked like a paint factory had exploded. Hanging on the walls were various portraits of clowns and circus scenes. <br />
<br />
Sally investigated the two closets filled with the various clown clothes provided by the resort. “Well Dad, it looks like you were wrong; we didn’t need all that luggage after all.” <br />
<br />
“I’m just glad they’re holding it in storage until we leave.” Jason placed the blue satchel he’d been carrying then tossed the pink one to his daughter. “Go ahead and change; Mr. Beck said our transformations start soon after we enter the room.” <br />
<br />
Sally nodded and walked into the bathroom. Kevin took off his shoes, socks, pants, briefs, shirt and finally his t-shirt. Opening the blue satchel, he was it was filled with nearly tent sized boxer shorts and tank tops, all striped polka dotted, or swirled in various colors like the motif of the room. <br />
<br />
‘How fitting,’ Kevin thought, ‘they make even our underwear look clown-like.’ <br />
<br />
He took out a pair of blue boxers with red polka dots and a yellow tank-top with thin green stripes. The elastic waistband of the boxers hung loosely about him, and the top was nearly three times too big, yet he could feel the cloth was very elastic.  <br />
<br />
Sally came old dressed in a leotard that was red on one side and yellow on the other, she had taken her hair out of the ponytail. <br />
<br />
She giggled at the sight of her father. “Dad, heheyaha, you look like you’re wearing a circus tent, heheyaha.” She clapped a hand over her mouth; her voice sounded higher, as if she had inhaled helium. <br />
<br />
“Sally, heheyaha,” Kevin’s own voice was now a pitch deeper and with a jolly lilt, “I think the change is starting, heheyaha.” <br />
<br />
A wave of giddiness unlike anything either of them felt before swept over the two. “Dad, heheyaha, I feel.... funny, heheyaha.” <br />
<br />
First to change was their complexions: Sally’s skin became a milky white hue from head to toe; while the areas around Kevin’s mouth and eyes became a matching white the rest of his skin became a peachy pink. <br />
<br />
Next, they gained weight, filling out their underclothes. Sally mostly in the chest and hips, gaining at least size CCC breasts and wide hips that filled her leotard, making her voluptuous if somewhat chubby for a twelve-year-old. Kevin’s waist expanded to at least a size seventy, the elastic waistband now feeling tight against an enormous beer belly, and the formerly loose boxers and top now felt snug on his new girth. <br />
<br />
Markings appeared on their face, completing their ‘makeup.’ Thin black arches appeared over Sally’s eyes replacing her eyebrows and her eyelids were shaded a light blue. Her eyes were outlined in black, soft red blushed the apples of her plump cheeks, while her lower lip became a bright red with a little circle on each end giving Sally a dainty clown smile. <br />
<br />
Kevin’s white eye-patches were topped with thick black arches that stretched up to his forehead, giving him a surprised look. His white muzzle was bordered with bright red that suited his fleshy face and inside a black clown smile stretched halfway down his chin, making it look like Kevin’s mouth was always open. <br />
<br />
Next their hair thickened and curled into a bushy afro style. Sally’s soft brown hair faded to a light strawberry red with silvery highlights while Kevin’s became a darker fire engine red. To Sally’s delight, the hair on top of her father’s head retreated into his skull, leaving him with a thick curly red mass around a pink bald pate. <br />
<br />
Their feet quickly expanded and widened; Kevin had size 20 clown feet with toes about seven inches wide. Sally’s feet were shorter, about size 15, but her toes were wider by at least three inches. <br />
<br />
Finally, a loud POP! filled the room. Kevin and Sally blinked, then saw that each now had a big, shiny red clown nose. Kevin’s was nearly the size of a peach, Sally’s more like a plum. <br />
<br />
The newly clowned father and daughter just stared at each other for nearly a minute. Finally, Sally touched her nose and gave a squeeze.  Honk! <br />
<br />
Gingerly, Kevin touched his own nose; it felt leathery to his fingers and nearly filled his hand. He squeezed it. Honk! it sounded, louder and deeper than Sally’s. He felt something else too, a wave of almost sexual pleasure coursing through his body. <br />
<br />
Sally walked over to her father; with her sudden weight gain and big feet she moved with a funny waddle. She reached up and rubbed her father’s bare dome. “Heheyaha, you are bald Dad!” Honk! <br />
<br />
Strangely enough Kevin didn’t mind being bald; he rather liked the way his daughter&#39;s fingers felt on his head. ‘Heheyaha, maybe I’ll start shaving my head.’ Honk! <br />
<br />
Even in his thoughts Kevin now punctuated his words with giggles. <br />
<br />
He next poked his daughter’s nose. Honk! She poked him back. Honk! The auguste father and whiteface daughter spent the next several minutes laughing and honking each other’s noses; they were both SSSSOOOO funny. <br />
<br />
Finally, they stopped. “What are we, going to do now Dad, heheyaha?” Sally asked then honked her nose. <br />
<br />
Kevin sighed. Honking his nose had awakened this strange feeling inside him. Since Sally’s mother had died two years ago in a car accident he’d seldom dated and was mostly celibate. Now, he felt the desire to go meet a woman, clown or otherwise, take her back to this room and-. <br />
<br />
Kevin quickly banished the thoughts from his head. He’d come here to be with his little girl; he’d have time for that stuff later. <br />
<br />
Spying the closets full of clown clothes he said, “Heheyaha, we might as well get dressed, heheyaha.” <br />
<br />
HONK HONK!</p>
