<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy could still speak but her new mouth was too strange, too foreign.  With broad, fleshy plates in place of teeth she could form words but apparently not well enough to trigger a spell.  Picking the book up in her mouth she knew what that her only hope of salvation was to make it Rusty.<br />
<br />
Unable to stand, Troy did the next best thing and firmly planted her hands and feet on the ground.  With a solid heave she was able to bring herself to all fours, albeit in a very awkward stance.  Her arms were much shorter than her legs, which caused her ass to press up into the air.  Her crotch breasts meanwhile, were still pressing out through her legs, forcing them apart as wide as they could go.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of her breasts, in her new position she looked comical – 6 massive breasts jiggled below her chest.  Next hung a massive, bloated belly.  Behind that, 2 more breasts had forced their way in between her legs, poking out behind her – with all 8 of her erect nipples clearly visible from the side.<br />
<br />
With each plodding movement, Troy heard a dripping sound – small beads of milk had formed on her teats and each step caused them to splash noisily onto the walkway below her.  She didn’t have time to care about that.  She had to keep trudging forward, trudging back onto the walkway.  Back around the corner to garage.  Back towards the front door.  Back to Rusty.  Back to a normal life – she hoped.<br />
<br />
Halfway to the door, Troy felt her vagina swell up as drops of lubricant pushed their way to edge of her lips and began slowly trickling into her fur.  A sensation of warmth washed over Troy’s body as the muscles in her vaginal canal began needily grinding against themselves.  Thoughts of getting fucked filled her mind – by what it didn’t matter.  Dragons, bulls, stallions… kobolds?  She could very clearly picture their tiny, reptilian penises, nowhere near large enough to satisfy her but still, the idea of just getting anything inside of her was so consuming that she began to drift into her own lust filled imagination… began to stop moving towards Rusty…<br />
<br />
Rusty!  She needed to get to Rusty!  The overwhelming fear of failure, of what might happen to her, of what had already happened to her was enough to let her focus.  It was enough to let her move forward.<br />
<br />
She took it step by agonizing step until finally she had made it to the door.  But when she placed a paw on the door handle, she realized that it was too fat and thick to be able to turn the knob!<br />
<br />
It was then that new memories began to flood into her mind.  Memories of the life this body had lived.<br />
<br />
She was in a cold, dark cave surrounded by tiny kobolds.  During the day they tied a harness to her and made her pull carts around a mine.  During the evening they sucked the milk from her tits as their tiny, needle like teeth cut into her delicate flesh.  At night she laid down in a dark corner.  It was muddy in her corner – it was muddy everywhere.  No matter what she did or where she went she couldn’t escape the mud.<br />
<br />
It was her breasts.  They were always so full, always so sore, always leaking.  Milk dripped from her wherever she went, mixing with the dirt and turning it into a rancid, filthy mess.<br />
<br />
She went to sleep every night covered in filth.  Woke up every day covered in filth.  The kobolds used her like cattle, treated her like cattle.  They would fuck her when they were bored, their cocks far too small to be of any pleasure.  And she needed pleasure.  She needed release.  She’d spent years in that dungeon, her pussy engorged and enflamed, her mind awash in lust.  She’d tried to pleasure herself, but her paws were completely useless and the walls of her corner were too smooth to be of any use.<br />
<br />
She remembered trying to use the handle of one of the pickaxes in the mine.  She remembered being beaten.  She remembered being so desperate that she tried again.  She remembered one of the kobolds smirking at her.  She remembered him taking the pickaxe, holding the handle up in a gesture of mercy and walking around behind her.  She remembered being so thrilled that he might take some small amount of pity on her.  That he might offer her some relief.  Then she felt the handle of the pickaxe smack painfully against her swollen lips.  She’d cried out, begged, pleaded for him to stop, but he just kept hitting her.  <br />
<br />
She looked into his eyes.  She saw that he enjoyed it.  Enjoyed her agony.  Enjoyed her begging him to stop.  He was at the bottom of the totem pole but, somehow, she was even lower.  And he enjoyed that.<br />
<br />
She remembered one day a kobold dressed in fine feathers came from the burrows above to see her, its arms filled with large syringes filled with a milky white substance.  Then she had felt cold cum being injected into her womb, one syringe after the other.  It was a pleasureless experience that did nothing to satisfy her.  Still, she remembered hoping, deep down inside, that maybe something would grow inside of her and sate her unending heat.  But the heat never abated, even as the new baby took root.<br />
<br />
Months had passed and the baby continued growing, all while she continued toiling in the depths of the mines.  Finally, another group of kobolds came from above to visit her.  Her belly was so swollen that she had assumed they were there to help her birth but, no, they had said.  <br />
<br />
“Master say come with us.  Master say you go first.”<br />
<br />
Master?  Who was the master?  The monster whose life Troy was now watching had no idea.  All she knew were the mines and the pitiful kobolds that lived in them.  She knew there were more kobolds above.  Kobolds that dressed better, ate better, and smelled better than the ones she lived with, but she didn’t know much about them beyond that.<br />
<br />
The new kobolds had taken her outside, taken her to this house.  They had told her that she was worthless.  That the master valued them but not her.  That she was to be fodder.  That there was a bad man with a book in this house.  That she was to go in and get it.  That the man was going to do something horrible to her when she did, but that would let the kobolds sneak up behind him.  She would be made to suffer so that they didn’t have to.  They told her that she should be thankful for that opportunity and, distressingly to Troy, that she felt the same way.<br />
<br />
She had gone in not knowing what horror to expect, not knowing how the man could do anything worse to her than what had already been done.  But when she got inside the house, what she found wasn’t a man.  It was a freakish, deformed mess begging for help.  She was so thankful that nothing bad had happened to her, so thankful that she could just get the book and get out.  So thankful that she would get to see her baby be born.  So she did as she was told, picked up the book, walked outside and…<br />
<br />
Troy was woken from her new memories by the sound of the doorknob begging to turn.  Rusty?  Was that Rusty?  Was Rusty coming to save her?  The door swung open, but it wasn’t Rusty standing in the doorway.  No, standing in front of her were the kobolds from her memory, an angry glare in their eyes.<br />
<br />
“Stupid Stinkbitch!  Kobold say bring book to him, not outside!”  <br />
<br />
The kobold slapped her across the face as he grabbed the book from her mouth.  Another kobold came out behind him and grabbed the leash attached to the collar that had formed around her neck.<br />
<br />
Stinkbitch?  She remembered them calling her that as they whipped her to pull the carts harder.  As they beat her for their own amusement.  As they drank from her tits.  As they fucked her.  As they took her to the latrine so that she could….  Her tongue ran over the plates of flesh that had replaced her teeth.  She didn’t want to go any further into those memories.<br />
<br />
Her name was Stinkbitch.  She was a skunkbeast that was kept for the help and amusement of a group of kobold miners.  Even if she fixed Rusty, he wouldn’t help her because he had no idea who she was.  She might still be Troy in her head, but to the rest of the world she might as well not exist.  <br />
<br />
She was stinking, filthy, dumb, worthless beast.  A beast that leaked rancid milk and skunk spray wherever she went.  And worst of all, the painful feeling of scales digging into her uterus told her that the only thing her future now held was giving birth to monster currently swaying in her belly.</p>
