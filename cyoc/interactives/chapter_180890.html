<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hmmm, it really is stuck fast,” Vicky said as she continued to examine the egg peeking out between the iguana’s legs, “well, why don’t I try to loosen things up a bit. Hopefully that will help to get the ball… er, ‘egg,’ rolling...”<br />
<br />
With no more warning than that, Vicky’s free hand suddenly darted for the egg, before she immediately started to use her index finger to rub and tease the scaly folds stretched around it.. <br />
<br />
Feeling this sudden contact made Carly hiss out in shock as she flailed her four legs uselessly. However, Vicky didn’t relent as she methodically made her way around the egg, making sure to pleasure every inch of the lizard’s sensitive flesh as she went.<br />
<br />
After a short while spent doing this, Vicky seemed to have a brainwave as she removed her finger and instead went to grab Carly’s long, flexible tail. Upon feeling this, the distressed iguana once again hissed out in protest. As it happened though, this did nothing to stop Vicky as, with a sinister chuckle, she brought the tip of Carly’s tail into contact with her stretched reptilian cloaca; where she started to rub it against the sensitive flesh like she did with her finger.<br />
<br />
After about a minute of this cruel foreplay, Vicky finally let go of Carly’s tail as she smiled down at her wickedly. “Well dear, it appears this may be more complicated than we first thought. I think I may have to help you restart the process, then perhaps you will have better luck on your second try!”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky suddenly darted back between the iguana’s legs, as she moved to grip the smooth egg firmly in her hand. Following this, Carly began to visibly jerk in discomfort as Vicky started to slowly twist the egg around inside her. Clearly, the feeling of the egg’s surface grinding against her cloaca’s sensitive walls was causing Carly no end of discomfort. And yet, in spite of this, you also thought you saw what looked like moisture clinging to the egg’s surface. Weirdly, as strange as this whole situation was, it seemed that some part of Carly’s brain was enjoying Vicky’s teasing, as yet more reptilian lubrication started to slowly drip out over the iguana’s scaly crotch.<br />
<br />
“That’s it dear,” Vicky said after a short while as she looked at the squirming reptile in her hands, “you’re starting to like that, aren’t you girl?” <br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, the iguana could only manage a short, breathless hiss in reply. Clearly, Carly was now being overwhelmed with both pain and pleasure as she felt her cloaca straining under the size and weight of the egg inside it.<br />
<br />
As bad as this was, things only got worse when Vicky started to ‘restart’ Carly’s birthing process.<br />
<br />
To this end, Vicky started to slowly press inwards as she continued to twist the iguana’s egg, causing the smooth object to slowly begin sinking back into the warm, wet depths where it had come from.<br />
<br />
This understandably made Carly even more distressed as she felt all of her work being undone as the large bulge moved back up inside her body. Soon, you were unable to see any traces of white at all between the iguana’s legs. Now, the lizard’s cloaca sat firmly sealed, with the troublesome egg now fully enveloped back inside her trembling body.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about that dear, but it had to be done,” Vicky said in a tone of pretend sympathy as she stroked the iguana’s chin. “Thankfully though, I have something that should take your mind off things until you are properly ready to lay again.”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky placed the exhausted iguana on the table beside the big glass terrarium. For a moment, you wondered if the lizard would try to escape, but then you realized that she was far too tired and encumbered to even bother thinking about it. Instead, Carly just did her best to make herself comfortable, as she lay down and tried to take her mind off what she was doing as she felt her egg beginning to slowly move through her body once again.<br />
<br />
You continued to watch the struggling iguana, until Vicky came back over to you, carrying two animals in her hands. You immediately recognised the female hummingbird and kangaroo rat as Elena and Lola respectively; though you clearly weren’t the only one, as Carly hissed out in dismay when she caught sight of her two transformed family members.<br />
<br />
“Awww, aren’t you happy to see your two sons?” Vicky said as she brought the bird and rodent over to the struggling iguana, “I thought you’d be proud to see what lovely, productive breeders Elena and Lola have become!”<br />
<br />
In response, Carly’s two transformed sons joined her in calling out in their new animalistic voices. Regrettably though, this only made Vicky laugh as she smiled down at the pathetic creatures beneath her. “Still so defiant, even after all these years. Well, I guess that will make this next part more fun for me; especially when your human resolve snaps and your true animal natures start to take over.”<br />
<br />
Hearing all of this made you and the other animals feel increasingly uneasy. However, this didn’t stop Vicky from proceeding as she started to reposition Elena and Lola for their next wave of humiliations.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, Vicky carefully lowered the hummingbird down onto the table, such that her beak was left pointing up in the air. Then, Vicky helped to slowly guide the heavily-pregnant kangaroo rat down on top of her, such that the rodent’s cum-stained crotch was lined-up perfectly with her sibling’s long, pointed beak.<br />
<br />
“Now then Elena,” she said to the distressed hummingbird, “your dear sister needs your help with her rather sizable litter. You see, Lola needs a little bit of a push to trigger her birthing process, which is where that nice, slender beak of yours will come in handy!” <br />
<br />
Hearing this made the hummingbird squawk out in protest. However, these cries were soon silenced when Vicky’s hand firmly clamped her beak shut, before it forced it to point straight upwards. This then provided a steady target to aim for as Vicky slowly lowered the kangaroo rat down over the long beak beneath it!<br />
<br />
Feeling this made Lola squeak out in surprise as she felt her vagina being wedged open by the advancing beak as she sank down onto it. Meanwhile, the silenced Elena desperately tried to stop what was happening as she frantically flapped her wings and tried to tilt her beak so that it wasn’t quite so upright. Sadly though, Vicky was far too strong and in-control to let anything phase her as she continued with her sick plan. <br />
<br />
The sadistic woman continued to smile and chuckle to herself as she forced Lola down further over her sibling’s beak. The distressed kangaroo rat squeaked out in dismay, but was ultimately powerless to resist as she was forced right down until she was left sitting on the base of the hummingbird’s beak.<br />
<br />
Following on from this, Vicky then turned to Lola’s front end, where she slowly started to guide her small, furry head down in between Elena’s feathery thighs. After realising what Vicky’s intentions were, Lola renewed her frantic squeaking as she felt her nose being brought into contact with her sibling’s recently-bred cloaca.<br />
<br />
“Lick!” Vicky commanded as she tightened her grip on the terrified rodent.<br />
<br />
The horrified kangaroo rat did her best to resist. However, soon the pain became too great as, with a big lick right over Elena’s dripping bird sex, Lola finally submitted to Vicky and got to work pleasuring her restrained sibling.<br />
<br />
With Lola now softly lapping at the hummingbird’s cloaca, Vicky seemed content to release the two transformed brothers and let them debase themselves on their own.<br />
<br />
Regrettably, this tactic seemed to work like a charm as both siblings quickly started to get into it. For Elena, the feeling of the rodent’s tongue on her cloaca was strangely good, which caused the bird to relax slightly as she stopped flapping her wings and unwittingly opened her beak wider into a more relaxed position.<br />
<br />
Disturbingly though, this widening of Elena’s beak set something off in Lola’s confused, lust-filled mind. Soon, you were left staring in amazement as the kangaroo rat started to slowly work her furry ass up and down over her sibling’s face, causing the beak in her vagina to start rubbing and stretching her most sensitive areas as she really started to get into it.<br />
<br />
With the two animals now shamelessly going at it, Vicky decided to turn her attention back to Carly, now that her egg had once again started to peak out from between her legs.<br />
<br />
“Ah, ah,” Vicky said as she picked Carly up by her waist, “it’s still a bit earlier for you to lay just yet…”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky’s hand darted for Carly’s egg, before she started to press and twist the smooth orb back inwards like she had before.<br />
<br />
Carly’s eyes widened in dismay as she felt a repeat of earlier taking place before her. The distressed lizard tried desperately to stop Vicky as she uselessly flailed her legs and hissed out in desperation. Sadly, this did nothing to dissuade Vicky, meaning that Carly’s egg was soon firmly lodged inside her once again, with the painful birthing process now undone for a second time.<br />
<br />
“Awww don’t look so sad dear,” Vicky said as she carried Carly over to where the hummingbird and kangaroo rat were busy enjoying themselves, “why can’t you be more like your sons: so horny, lustful and feminine? No matter, I know just how to get you excited; let’s give this a try…”<br />
<br />
With no more warning than that, Vicky suddenly pressed two of her fingers straight into Carly’s cloaca!<br />
<br />
Feeling this made the iguana hiss out in shock as she felt the fingers beginning to rapidly thrust into her slick reptilian vent. However, Vicky was determined to humiliate the former property developer as much as possible as she occasionally stopped to scissor Carly’s vent open with her fingers, before relentlessly plunging her digits into the murky wetness where the egg was still buried.<br />
<br />
Initially, Carly redoubled her efforts to break free from Vicky’s grip by flailing and writhing around even more frantically than before. However, after just a short while of being intimately fingered by Vicky, the iguana’s body language quickly started to change. Soon, the helpless lizard’s protests started to fade away, while her previously angry hisses began to sound increasingly hot and needy. In fact, Carly soon surrendered utterly to her body’s urges, as she simply shut her eyes and allowed Vicky to keep teasing her reptilian vent however she pleased.<br />
<br />
And so, with Carly and her two sons now all happily having their sexes teased, it soon became clear from the various noises filling the room that all three were starting to enjoy themselves.<br />
<br />
Firstly, thanks to Vicky’s relentless fingering, Carly was now hissing out in acceptance as she let herself enjoy her body’s growing pleasure. As a result, the iguana was now actively rolling her hips over Vicky’s fingers; apparently loving the penetration as her whole body shuddered in pure animalistic need.<br />
<br />
As for Elena and Lola, both of them were also fully engrossed with their lustful performance as they humped and ground together in unison. Now, both animals had sticky smears on their faces; a clear sign that their efforts to please each other were succeeding as they shamelessly pressed each other to new heights of wild bestial passion.<br />
<br />
With all three animals having completely surrendered to the pleasure coursing through their bodies, it was only a matter of time before they all reached the inevitable climax which you could sense was building.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Carly eventually let out one final hiss of delight as a gentle spray of wetness suddenly shot out around the fingers stuffed into her reptilian vent. <br />
<br />
In response to this, Vicky quickly extracted her sticky fingers before forcing them into Carly’s unexpecting mouth; and upon noticing the iguana’s surprise, Vicky simply laughed as she began to coat the inside of the lizard’s snout with her own sweet feminine juices.<br />
<br />
While this was going on, Elena and Lola also drove each other to orgasm as they shuddered together in unison. The upshot of this was that both of their faces and crotches were left stained with fluids as they unleashed all of the sexual tension that had been building between them.<br />
<br />
With that though, it seemed that Vicky’s sick performance was complete. However, when Vicky returned the three animals to their terrarium, you were slightly confused to see them all being placed together in the iguanas’ compartment.<br />
<br />
“There we are Carly,” Vicky said in a sinister tone as she sealed the terrarium shut, “now you and your daughters can support each other as you give birth. Aren’t I a kind owner!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made the three animals cry out in protest, that is, until various birthing pains instead started to draw their full attention. Meanwhile, Vicky made sure you were watching as you both stared at the three animals as they struggled desperately to give birth.<br />
<br />
The pain and horror was plain to see in the eyes of all three animals as their bodies acted purely out of instinct. To this end, Lola made her furry, swollen body slump heavily onto one side, where she started to screech out in discomfort as she tried to force her litter through her birth canal.<br />
<br />
As for Carly and Elena, both were now squatting down low to the floor so that they could more easily lay their eggs. Both animals cried out as flashes of white emerged from between their legs; stretching their sexes open wide as they crested at their widest point.<br />
<br />
This agonizing process continued for what felt like ages before, mercifully, all three animals felt their offspring finally leaving their bodies.<br />
<br />
For Elena at least, it looked like her ordeal was over as she stared stunned at the egg she had just laid. As for Carly and Lola though, it seemed that they still had work to do, as they continued to cry out in anguish upon feeling their next youngsters in the pipeline making their way towards their birth canals.<br />
<br />
When it was all over, you were left staring at the three exhausted animals as they lay huddled close to each other on the floor of the terrarium. Now, littering the surrounding area, were seven white eggs, six of which belonged to Carly. As well as this, Lola now had four small furry bodies pressed into her chest as they fed from her milk-filled teats. Clearly, all three animals were relieved that it was all over; though you suspected, knowing Vicky, that it wouldn’t be long before they would have to go through the same ordeal again.<br />
<br />
For the time being though, Vicky seemed happy to leave Carly and her sons alone with their new offspring as she placed their terrarium back where she had found it.<br />
<br />
“Wasn’t that beautiful,” Vicky said to you as she stepped back from the Cruiz family, “giving such vile people a more noble purpose in life is why I enjoy this so much! Now then, who else would be fun to show you?”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky started to sort through the various cages and tanks surrounding her as she hunted for her next victim.<br />
<br />
Before long, Vicky returned with another container, which she placed on the table in front of you. Then, you were compelled to stand and listen as Vicky started yet another one of her disturbing stories...</p>
