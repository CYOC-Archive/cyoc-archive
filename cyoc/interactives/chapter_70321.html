<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From the Writing.com story of the same name.<br />
<br />
Summery: Paul Taylor was a normal 17 year old guy in his last year of a normal High School in the UK. He had <br />
good mates, a hot girlfriend and bright future. In short Paul had a perfect life until a freak accident <br />
changed his life forever, leaving him stuck in the body of a middle-aged woman.<br />
<br />
Unlike most Body Swap stories, his friends and family are fully aware of the swap and the story picks up <br />
several weeks after the accident as he prepares to re-enter his life in his new body. How he copes is up to <br />
you.<br />
<br />
This is a theme that I am thinking about writing a story for posting on Fictionmania and I am interested in <br />
getting some ideas for content. As such I'm going to give a little guidance to push the story in the right <br />
direction. Paul is not happy with this swap and this is not a story where he suddenly adapts and enjoys his <br />
situation. As far as he is concerned, his life has been ruined.<br />
<br />
How will Paul adjust to being a middle-aged woman? Will he stick it out and finish school? How will cope with <br />
wearing female clothes and, worse, the school uniform? How will his friends and family treat him? Will his <br />
girlfriend still want to be with him now that not only is he a woman, but he's also old enough to be her <br />
mother?<br />
<br />
Are they're any hangovers from the life of the woman who's body he inhabits? Is he stuck with her habits and <br />
addictions, her like and dislikes? How about the family of the woman? Do they want him to try and live her <br />
life instead?<br />
<br />
Characters <br />
Paul Taylor - A 17 year old High School student in the final year of high school cruelly swapped into the body <br />
of a middle-aged woman. Until the accident he was popular, bright and a talented footballer (soccer), poised <br />
to go to university on finishing his A-Levels and looking forward to pursuing a career as a physiotherapist. <br />
<br />
Rachel Jenkins - One of the the schools hottest girls and Paul's 18 year-old girlfriend. She is popular but <br />
friendly and well liked by most. They have been dating for a year and their relationship has recently become <br />
intimate. Rachel was looking forward to going to uni with Paul later this year, but he has refused to see her <br />
since the swap and she is anxious about the future.<br />
<br />
Colin Howards and Dave Reynolds - Pauls best friends since they were kids. Both play on the same football team <br />
as Paul and are pretty typical 17 year old boys, interested in girls, cars and turning 18 this year so they <br />
can finally go to the pub legally. They have also not seen Paul since the accident.<br />
<br />
Linda Parks - Paul's 38 year old mother and part-time receptionist at his school. Linda raised Paul on her own <br />
after his father left them when he was a baby but has recently remarried and, whilst she and Paul are very <br />
close, she was looking forward to him going to university so she can give more attention to her new husband. <br />
Initially shocked to find her son is now a woman older than her, Linda has been Pauls main support since the <br />
accident. She is convinced he should finish school and continue with his plans for life and is determined to <br />
help him adjust to being a woman.<br />
<br />
John Parks - Linda 39 year old new husband and reluctant step-father. John and Paul have a strained <br />
relationship, but not openly unfriendly. He met Linda through friends two years ago and enjoyed a whirlwind <br />
romance that resulted in their marriage six months ago. He was also looking forward to Paul leaving home and <br />
was hoping to convince Linda to move abroad when he did.<br />
<br />
Of course add your own characters as the stories develop. Some choices for Paul's new body are provided in the <br />
first chapter. Feel free to write you own, as long as they're over 40 and female. Please write at least two <br />
full paragraphs for each add (unless its setting up chapter options). Any short and silly paragraphs will be <br />
deleted. No magical transformations and changes, in this story the transformation has already happened and is <br />
permanent. This story is about Paul adjusting to his new life, but please try to avoid chapters that endlessly <br />
described Paul &quot;exploring himself&quot; these are usually pretty boring, otherwise sex (with a male or female) is <br />
welcome.<br />
<br />
Chapters will remain at my own desecration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chapter 1:<br />
<br />
As the grey light of dawn crept into his bedroom Paul woke from an uneasy sleep and stared up at the ceiling, <br />
feeling sick with anxiety. He had been dreading this day for weeks, ever since that fateful day four weeks ago <br />
when his life was ruined forever. Paul had taken his girlfriend shopping in celebration of her 18th birthday. <br />
It had been a pretty good day, despite waiting for hours whilst Rachel endlessly tried on clothes and shoes. <br />
They had finished up with a drink in the pub and Rachel took great pleasure in teasing him with the fact it <br />
would be another 2 months before he could legally join her. <br />
<br />
It was when they left the pub, Paul made a decision that would change his life forever. It was an early <br />
december evening and the weather was atrocious. Cold rain was hammering around them and forming large puddles. <br />
Paul knew the truck was in trouble as soon as he saw it. No one would ever know what had caused the driver to <br />
lose control but the wet leaves on the road and heavy rain meant he had no chance of recovering once his <br />
ungainly load started to jackknife. Paul's first thought was what was such a big truck doing driving down a <br />
small town centre road. But that thought didn't last long because then he noticed the woman standing in <br />
directly its path. She was talking on her mobile phone and holding an umbrella, completely oblivious to the <br />
overturned truck bearing down on her. <br />
<br />
Paul had only seconds to react and had set off at running without even shouting a warning. Young, athletic and <br />
fit, he had easily closed the distance between him and the hapless woman before the truck straight. Tackling <br />
her at full pace they had both landed heavily in a large and deep muddy puddle just as the heavy vehicle <br />
slammed into an adjacent wall with an appalling crash, spilling its strange load of machinery into the puddle. <br />
Soaked and heart racing with adrenaline, Paul sighed with relief and lifted himself up to ask the woman <br />
underneath him if she was OK. However, before he could, she screamed pointing behind him. Paul span round just <br />
in time to see an electricity pole dislodge by the crash fall, sparking, in to the mix of broken electronics <br />
and muddy water in which they were lying. Paul's last thought, before the high voltage electricity shuddering <br />
through his body rendered him unconscious, was that being electrocuted to death should be more painful.<br />
<br />
Paul had been in the coma for a week when he finally awoke and he soon wished that he hadn't. His mum standing <br />
over him in tears told him to be brave and the doctor told him to prepare himself for a shock before showing <br />
him the mirror. He'll never forget that scream. Mainly because he had never screamed like that before. He had <br />
touched his face in disbelief that the reflection of the woman in the mirror was now his own. In the end, the <br />
doctor was forced to sedate him before he went back into shock. <br />
<br />
Hours later, once he had calmed down and still under the fog of sedation they had explained what had happened. <br />
The truck was carrying top-secret experimental equipment ironically designed for accessing the minds of <br />
comatose patiences. The mixture of electricity and water had somehow swapped his mind into the body of the <br />
woman he had saved. Or at least that was the theory. No one could quite figure out how it had happened. They <br />
had only realised this had happened the day before when the woman had awoken in his own body and started <br />
raving that she was someone else. They certainly didn't know how to reverse it. Not that it mattered. Even <br />
sedated he had been horrified to hear that the woman had not survived the shock and the heart of his injured <br />
former body had give out just hours after being sedated. He was stuck like this for life.<br />
<br />
Paul had spent most of his time in the weeks that had followed sobbing on suicide watch. His mum, Linda, had <br />
been a rock staying with him most days and trying to convince him his life was far from over. That being a <br />
middle aged woman would not be so bad and that it needn't change the plans for his life. Paul thought she was <br />
talking crap. How could things ever be the same again. But he had finally agreed with her, if only to convince <br />
the hospital to let him leave and go home. <br />
<br />
That had been a week ago. Today he would go back to school. Mainly against his will. He knew his mum was <br />
talking sense, that he needed the qualifications to even attempt the life he wanted but he was still dreading <br />
it. &quot;Just try it!&quot; his mum had begged him, &quot;It's six more months and then you're free to do whatever you want <br />
with your life. If you hate it as much as you think then you can leave and you'll be no worst off.&quot; Paul could <br />
never refuse his mum, even now he was older than her. He almost completely refused when he found out that the <br />
school would still insist on a middle aged woman wearing the girls uniform. But as always his mum had talked <br />
him round. He was dreading the reaction of the people at school when he walked through the doors looking like <br />
this. By now everyone knew what had happened. He sat up with the uncomfortable feeling of his female body <br />
shifting and gazed at the uniform hanging up by the mirror. A simple white blouse, black tights and a green <br />
plaid skirt sized to fit his new body. Sighing he rubbed his eyes and gazed with dread at his new face. The <br />
face of the woman he saved. The face of:</p>
