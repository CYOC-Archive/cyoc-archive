<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The energy she felt within her had slowed down, but it hadn’t dissipated.<br />
<br />
Grace could still feel herself growing, and ahe could see her muscles still swelling under her skin, looking <br />
bigger than any other bodybuilder she could remember seeing, male or female. Her gym clothes were incredibly <br />
tight on her, straining to contain her growing body, the seams slowly popping and tearing as she pumped up <br />
bigger, ever-larger. She lumbered to the end of the locker aisle, her huge thighs rolling around each other, <br />
and looked around. Although the locker room looked empty, she could hear a couple girls chatting a few aisles <br />
over, and someone was in the shower.<br />
<br />
Surely, someone would soon notice her. She was growing too immense to hide! She couldn’t hide in the locker <br />
room forever! She had to get out of here! She had to get back to her apartment!<br />
<br />
Grace returned to her locker and gathered her things, bulky body making it difficult. She then left the locker <br />
room as quickly as she could, her thighs pressing against each other more and more as she walked, causing her <br />
to waddle. She could feel her shorts straining to hold together, the seams on her seat tearing even more as <br />
her bubble-butt expanded, and the fabric rubbed together between her inner-thighs. She could feel her triceps <br />
rub against her lats as her arms swayed, even though her arms stuck out over a 45-degree angle. She stepped <br />
out and right away headed for the parking lot, people gawking as she passed. Many loudly commented on her too-<br />
tight clothing, others pointed out her large bubble-butt, and others still commented on her muscle-gut and <br />
chest, most not even aware that she was a woman.<br />
<br />
Grace ignored them. She hustled as quickly as she could across the parking lot and fumbled with the door lock <br />
of her car. Once she got it, she clambered in.<br />
<br />
The seat of Graces’s shorts finally gave way, busting open as she sat down. She cursed quietly and started the <br />
car. She had an awkward time driving home, it was tough for her using the gas and break pedals; her thighs <br />
were fighting each other for space. She could feel her hamstrings lifting her legs in the seat, while her <br />
growing quads pressed against the underside of the steering wheel, making it difficult to turn the wheel. She <br />
was half-way home when her shorts started tearing along the sides, so enormous her thighs were growing.<br />
It was becoming quite the tight squeeze in her car. She could feel her lats growing thicker, pressing into the <br />
backrest and spilling out to the sides, her shirt tearing down the back and around the armpits, forcing her <br />
arms upward, which made it uncomfortable to hold onto the steering wheel. Her biceps and pecs were expanding <br />
as well and started to press against each other, forcing her to hold tighter onto the steering wheel.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t adjust the seat. Each time she tried, her chest would press against the steering wheel, honking <br />
the horn, and she couldn’t squeeze her thickening forearms between her swelling thighs to reach the lever. The <br />
seams of her shirt were losing the fight to contain her, pecs larger than her modest breasts by that point, <br />
and the seams along the shoulders, collar, and sleeves started tearing open. How big was she going to get?<br />
<br />
Grace cursed loudly. “C’mon! Just a little further...”<br />
<br />
She finally made it home, and hastily parked the car, nearly driving it over the curb. She managed to squeeze <br />
herself out of the car and waddled up the walkway to her apartment. Each step was difficult to take. Looking <br />
down as she climbed the stairs, he could only see her growing chest. So, with her swelling legs, she had to <br />
feel her way up each step, placing her feet uncertainly, and with a heavy thud. Luckily, it was a short <br />
walkway, and she didn’t have far to climb.<br />
<br />
It was a lot of work for her still-growing body. Grace was only half-way up the stairs when the last seams <br />
holding her shorts and shirt ripped. Her shorts hung off her like a loin cloth, hanging on only by the elastic <br />
band. Her shirt was falling off of her in patches, as her arms tore the sleeves, her deltoids shredding the <br />
shoulders, and her lats and chest pulling the torso of the shirt apart; Grace regretted no wearing a sports <br />
bra now that her shirtwas almost done for, but it probably wou;dn't have lasted long like this anyway. Her <br />
neck and traps were thickening even more, causing the collar of the shirt to tear under their rapid growth. <br />
She was shirtless by the time he reached the top of the walkway, bared chested and hoping none of her <br />
neighbors reported her for indecent exposure.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily from the exertion, she reached the front door of her apartment, thankful for living on the <br />
first floor. Fumbling for the keys, she managed to open the door and fall into the foyer with a heavy thud. <br />
With great effort, Guy managed to pick himself up. He lumbered into the kitchen and grabbed the wall phone. <br />
She dialed a number and pinned the phone between her head and shoulder. Her shoulders were still growing, and <br />
with her thickening neck, she could no longer hold her head in that position like she used to; she nearly <br />
dropped the phone. She then tried holding it to her ear while it still rang on the other line.<br />
<br />
“C’mon, pick up. Pick up!” Grace could feel her bicep pressing against her forearm, pushing the phone away <br />
from her ear. She fought against it, but still her biceps and forearms grew. She was losing the ability to <br />
bend her arms inward! She continued resisting, growling in frustration. “Pick up, God damn it!”</p>
