<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley Wood, a famous writer, just found out she was pregnant.  The 24 year old gleamed with happiness as she held the pregnancy test in her hand.  She rushed out of the bathroom wearing only her pink silk underwear.  The technology was now advanced enough to detect pregnancy at the moment of conception.  The device in Ashley’s hand displayed that she had just conceived.  Her husband Michael’s sperm has just fertilized one of her eggs.<p>

“Michael, I’m pregnant.  We’re going to have a baby!”, Ashley shouted and ran into her husbands arms.<p>

“That’s wonderful”, Michael smiled and hugged his wife, remembering last week where they decided to try for a baby and tossed the condoms into the trash.  Now after last night’s romp in the bed, they were going to have a baby.  “So is it going to be a boy or a girl?”, he asked.<p>

Ashley looked down, “Not sure, let me check.”<p>

Ashley sat on the bed and pulled out the pregnancy monitor device, the one that told her that she was pregnant.  She pulled down her pink panties and pulled out a cord from the device and pushed it up her birth canal.  After pushing buttons to go through the menus, she came to the check sex of baby option.  Ashley pushed the confirmation button and an hour glass appeared on the screen, flipping over and over for the next minute.  A ding was heard from the device and the display read, “Girl”.<p>

Ashley smiled, “We’re having a baby girl”. She pulled the cord from her opening and turned off the device.<p>

They celebrated the news by making love slowly and passionately on the bed.  Two hours later, Michael got up.<p>

“I have to go to work”, Michael said as he kissed his wife on the cheek.<p>

“So soon,”, sighed Ashley as she wrapped the bed sheet around her nakedness.<p>

Ashley watched as her husband got dressed and left for work.  She pulled the covers over her and slept for another two hours.  Getting up she went to the bathroom and took a shower.  During her shower, Ashley pondered the life that was just beginning inside her womb.<p>

“What’s it like for you my baby girl, growing in my womb and just starting life?”, Ashley pondered as she rubbed soap on her flat stomach.<p>

After rinsing off, Ashley stepped out of the shower and dried off.  When she was dry she posed in front of the mirror on the bathroom door.  Her blonde hair, in tangles from being dried by a towel, hanged to her shoulders.  Eyes of bluish grey looked over her body as she roamed her hands around.  She turned sideways and looked at her profile, imagining what she would look like 8 months pregnant.  After spending several minutes looking her self over, she brushed her teeth and combed her hair.  Ashley made breakfast after putting on a fresh pair of underwear.   While eating her breakfast, she pondered some more.<p>

“I still need an idea for my next book, something different, and something never done before”, Ashley thought as she sipped her coffee.<p>

She picked up the newspaper and started reading.  She came across an article about the new drug Regenerx and all the things it could do.  Once she finished the article an idea popped into her head.<p>

“Well baby, mommy just had an idea for her new book and you’re going to help mommy with it.”, smiled Ashley as she placed one of her hands on her navel.<p>

Ashley finished her breakfast and cleaned up.  She grabbed her cell phone and called her publisher.<p>

“Rachael, this is Ashley Wood.”, said Ashley into the receiver.<p>

“Ashley, how’s it going? Did you find the inspiration for your new book.”, came from the phone.<p>

“I just thought of it Rachael and it’s going to be unique.  But it’s going to take around 9 months to do the research for it.”, replied Ashley.<p>

“Nine months?”<p>

“Yep, I’ll call you back in about one year with the book.”, smiled Ashley.<p>

“I’ll be waiting patiently.  I hope it’s a winner.”<p>

“Me too, bye Rachael.”<p>

Ashley hung up the phone and went to get dressed.  She locked the door and drove to the nearest drug store.  She felt giddy as she strolled through the store searching the isles for what she wanted.<p>

“Can I help you miss?”, asked one of the clerks in a high pitched voice.<p>

Ashley turned and looked at the young girl, who looked like she was still in grade school.  She was wearing a purple sun dress with a white apron around her waist.  “Aren’t you too young to be working here?”, she asked.<p>

“I’m older than I look, okay”, sighed the girl.<p>

“Okay okay, I’m just looking for the drug Regenerx.  Do you have any?”, she asked.<p>

The girl coughed and looked around. “Hmm follow me”.<p>

“What’s wrong?” asked Ashley.<p>

The girl put a finger to her lips.  “Shhhh, keep it down.  Regenerx is not fully released to the public just yet.  The government is trying to regulate it.”<p>

Puzzled Ashley followed the girl to the back of the store.  The girl used keys and opened the door in the back.  She disappeared for about a minute and came back with a bottle labeled Regenerx.<p>

“I have a private stash hidden in the back.”, said the girl.<p>

“You seem to know a lot about this drug”, said Ashley as she looked at the bottle.<p>

The girl looked around and whispered, “That’s because I’m a victim of it.  I used to be 40 years old.  A group of teenagers came in one day and took some bottles.  They said they wanted to be older and I looked like a good candidate.  Before I could stop them, they started to siphon off my age.  By the time they were done, I was left as a little girl.  That was two years ago when the drug just came out.  I’m now 10 years old again and going to the 5th grade.  My younger sister is raising me as her daughter.”<p>

“I’m so sorry to hear that. Why didn’t you use the drug to become older?”, said Ashley almost thinking twice about what she wanted to do with the drug.<p>

“At first I wanted to but actually I’m enjoying being young again.  I don’t have to worry about periods for another three years and I’m doing better in school this time around.”<p>

“How much for the bottle?” asked Ashley.<p>

“Fifty dollars”, said the girl.<p>

“That’s pricey”<p>

“You get what you pay for and I’m in limited supply.”<p>

Ashley handed over the money.  The girl smiled and put it in her pocket.  Just then a voice was heard near the front of the store.<p>

“Michelle, where are you, there are customers needing assistance.”, came a woman’s voice.<p>

“That’s my sister, my new mom”, Michelle whispered.  “Coming mommy, just helping a lady with her order.”, she yelled back.<p>

“Hurry up, in two hours I need to take you to school.”<p>

“Okay”, said Michelle loudly.  “Sorry I gotta go, have fun with the drug”, she smiled and waved good-bye.<p>

Ashley pocketed the bottle and left the store. Many thoughts were going through her head as she headed home.  How was she going to explain her plan to Michael.  Back home she kept going over her plan in her mind and how she was going to convince her husband to accept it.  Hours later, Ashley made dinner and waited for Michael to return from work.  When the front door opened, Ashley rushed to the door and gave her husband a passionate hug and kiss.<p>

“What’s that for?”, asked Michael.<p>

“What, can’t I give my handsome husband a hug and kiss?”, she smiled.<p>

Michael smiled coyly, “Normally no, but I know you.  You want something.”<p>

Ashley blushed and looked down, Michael knew her too well.  “You’re right but let me explain after dinner.”<p>

Michael shook his head, “Okay after dinner then.”<p>

Ashley and Michael sat down and ate dinner.  Michael kept wondering what Ashley was up to.<p>

“Michael, I came up with an idea for my next book”, said Ashley before putting more food into her mouth.<p>

“That’s wonderful! You’ve been in rut for months now. So what is it?”, asked Michael.<p>

Ashley looked at Michael, “It’s what I need you to help me with.  I need to do some in depth research with your blessing.”<p>

“What type of research?”<p>

“Personal experience research”, said Ashley putting another bite of food in her mouth.<p>

Michael was now interested at what she had planned.  “So there’s more you are not telling me.”<p>

Ashley blushed and looked down, “It involves the drug Regenerx.”<p>

Michael thought for a second, “You mean that new drug that makes you feel young and for the next hour after taking it, you’re able to exchange aspects of another person or animal.  Don’t tell me you bought some.”<p>

“I did, and it’s for my new book.  I need it to do my research, something that has not been done before.”, explained Ashley.<p>

“So your new book is about the drug?”<p>

Ashley shook her head slowly, “No, it’s just the tool I need for the research.”<p>

“I need you to explain why you need to use this drug for your new book.”, said Michael looking at wife sternly.<p>

Ashley gulped a piece of carrot. “After dinner I’ll explain everything.”<p>

The rest of the meal was in silence as Ashley thought of her story to tell Michael.  Michael meanwhile kept thinking what type of research she was planning with the use of Regenerx.  The silence continued while they cleaned up the table.  The moved to the living room and sat on the sofa.<p>

“Well to start off, the title for my new book will be something like, ‘Journey in the womb: My experience.’ ”, Ashley started to explain.<p>

Michael was stunned in silence as Ashley continued explaining what she had planned.  For the next thirty minutes, Ashley told as best she could her plan with the drug and their new baby growing inside of her womb.<p>

“No one has done something like this, and I want to write it before anyone else gets the idea.”, finished Ashley.<p>

“Are you serious, do you know how dangerous this is and how this will affect our family?”, questioned Michael in a serious tone.<p>

Ashley looked pleadingly into Michael’s eyes, “Yes I know exactly the risks I’m taking, but I need to do this for my book.  I’ve had writer’s block for almost a year now and this is the only inspiration I have.  It will be only for nine months, and then we can be together again.”<p>

Michael knew how much writing meant to Ashley and how she was serious about this plan.  He was scared not only for her but for their unborn daughter.  “What about the baby, what will happen to her?”<p>

“She’ll be fine, we’ll just get to see how she’ll look all grown up sooner than normal.  And when I’m born, we’ll use the drug and trade ages again, she’ll be a baby and I’ll be your wife once more. Though we’ll need to decide on a name for her.”, said Ashley as she placed her hand on her bare stomach.<p>

Michael sighed and sat more deeply into the sofa, “Your right about one thing, and I’ve been thinking of one all day today.”<p>

Ashley smiled, “Oh what is it?”<p>

“Amber Dawn Wood.  Named after my grandmother.”, said Michael.<p>

“I love it, my sweet little Amber. Mommy loves you yes she does.”, cooed Ashley as she rubbed her belly.<p>

Still not sure about her plan, Michael wanted her confirmation again, “Are you really sure you still want to go through this. What if there are problems?”<p>

Ashley kissed Michael deeply, “Yes I do.  We’ll face those problems together, even if it means I end up being your daughter instead of wife. Speaking of which, I want to spend one more night with my husband before going back to the womb.”  She placed one hand onto Michael’s crotch.<p>

The couple made out on the sofa.  Clothes and underwear were slowly removed as the passion heated up.  Michael and Ashley made it to their bedroom before they went into heavy foreplay.  They wanted this night to last forever.  By the time the sun started to shine through the window in the morning, the two lovers had gone three rounds of love making.<p>  

Ashley woke up and crawled out of bed.  The junction between her legs was a little sore and crusted over with dried semen.  Smiling she remembered last nights romp in the bed.<p>

“I need to clean up”, giggled Ashley as she walked to the master bathroom.<p>

The sound of the shower caused Michael to wake up.  A grin came to his face as he also remembered last nights love fest.  But then a sad look came upon him as he knew what today held.<p>

“I need to support her decision, even though I don’t feel right about it”, Michael thought as he pulled the covers back and sat up on the bed.<p>

Ashley came out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her.  “I’ll go make breakfast while you shower.”<p>

Michael nodded and walked to the bathroom.  As Michael showered, Ashley dropped her towel and pulled on a lacey white panty and bra set.  Dressed only in her underwear, Ashley walked downstairs to the kitchen. <p> 

“Well Amber, mommy is going to eat her last meal before becoming your baby in your womb.”, cooed Ashley as she rubbed her stomach.<p>

When Michael stepped out of the shower, he could smell eggs being cooked on the stove.  He was feeling hungry and quickly got dressed in his boxers.  Ashley was still cooking when he got downstairs and went into the living room to watch the morning news.<p>  

The TV came to life, “..85 degree’s is the high for today and look for clear skies.  In other news, the governor announced last night that changes in the school system were needed for the increase of animal hybrid children due to the drug Regenerx.  Also adult’s who find themselves children again will be treated as children and have to go back to school or if living alone, to foster homes.  Studies have shown that rejuvenated adults tend to act more the age they appear due to some mental regression but it seems to have no effect on their memory.  One doctor even showed that education is sometimes suppressed or blocked to the age they learned it the first time and if the subject is left at that age, they will need to relearn everything again.  Now to sports…”.  Michael turned off the TV when he felt his wife’s hands on his shoulders.<p>

“Time to eat”, said Ashley as she kissed Michael’s forehead.<p>

The couple settled down and began to consume their morning meal.<p>

Michael still wanted assurance, “Are you still sure you want to do this?”<p>

Ashley sighed, “Yes, I made up my mind.  I’m thankful for your concern but I’m doing this for my book.”<p>

“I’ve been thinking, when you swap ages with our baby girl, will she’ll be a baby in an adult body.  I don’t think I’m ready to take care of an adult baby.”, Michael put forth.<p>

Ashley looked into Michael’s eyes, “At first I thought the same thing, until I read that while you are connected, you could teach and transfer information to the other subject.  While we are connected, I’m going to teach Amber everything she’ll need to take care of herself.”<p>

Michael sighed, “That’s a relief, I didn’t want to change a 24 year old’s diaper.” <p>

Ashley finished drinking her glass of juice.  “Honey, can you video tape our transfer, so we can have a record of it, just in case.”<p>

“That’s a good idea.  No one is ever going to believe this.”<p>

“Speaking of which, so that no government agents get involved, please do not tell anyone especially the doctors about me being in Amber’s womb.”, worried Ashley thinking of what they might do.<p>

“You’re right, they might take Amber away and have her and you put in a lab or something.  I’ll just say she’s my cousin staying with us.”, said Michael.<p>

“So what about my absence, the neighbors might get suspicious?”, questioned Ashley.<p>

Michael thought for about three minutes, “I know, we’ll say you are back at your mother’s house in the country writing your book.  Also, saying that you need the isolation and peace and quiet to get it done.”<p>

Ashley smiled, “That might work nicely.  And besides its not far off the truth, I’ll just be resting in the womb for my book.”<p>

The two lovers finished their meal and cleaned up the dishes.  While Michael went to get the video camera, Ashley went to the cabinet and pulled out the vial of Regenerx.  She measured one dose, the vial held two doses.  After putting the vial back away, she lifted the glass.<p>

“Well here going nothing, soon I’ll be in the womb starting life again.”, Ashley said to herself.  With one quick gulp, she downed the liquid.<p>

A warm tingling feeling spread throughout her body.  A feeling of bountiful energy filled her.  She felt like a young girl and even giggled.  Just then Michael came back with the camera.<p>

Noticing Ashley strange behavior, “You already took it didn’t you?”, Michael asked.<p>

Giggling like a young girl, “Yep, and it feels great.  I feel like a kid again”, Ashley smiled.<p>

Taking Ashley’s hand, “We better do this in the bedroom upstairs so no one spies us through the windows.”, cautioned Michael and guided his bouncy wife up the stairs to the bedroom.<p>

Ashley laid on the bed, “The warm feeling is fading”.<p>

With camera in hand, “Are you ready for this?”, Michael questioned.<p>

Ashley nodded her head, “I’m ready as I’ll ever be.” She closed her eyes and placed her hands on her belly.<p>

Michael watched in awe as Ashley’s stomach slowly started to inflate.  Months of pregnancy were passing every few seconds.  At the same time Ashley’s breasts grew half a cup size and started leaking milk through her bra.<p>

“Amber’s moving, I can feel her.”, smiled Ashley as she pulled off her panties.  “She’s ready to be born”.   Ashley was now 8 months younger since she has been transferring her age to Amber.  She spread her legs and bent her knees.  “Here she comes”, said Ashley as once more she closed her eyes and concentrated on transferring her age to her baby.<p>

Ashley’s stomach grew just a bit more and suddenly she was grunting from contractions.  Her labor was happening fast.  Since Ashley was also regressing at the same time, her pain from the labor was reduced due to accelerated healing.  Michael moved to get a better view and saw the baby’s head crowning out of Ashley’s birth canal.  With one final grunt, Ashley pushed out her baby onto the bed.  Tiny Amber started crying.  The strange thing was the umbilical cord pulled off of Amber’s belly button and receded back into Ashley’s womb.<p>  

“She’s adorable”, cooed Ashley as she lifted her baby into her arms.  “Michael, she has your eyes.” She smiled looking into her baby’s face.<p>  

Michael walked over and looked at his newborn daughter.  “You’re right she does”, he said looking at the green eye’s of his daughter.<p>

“She’s hungry”, said Ashley and gave Michael Amber to hold while she removed her bra.  “That’s better, they were getting tight”.<p> 

Michael handed Amber back to Ashley, who immediately started to suckle milk from her mother.<p>

Mother and daughter bonded for the next ten minutes while Amber nursed all the milk she could from Ashley’s nipples.  Once full, baby Amber closed her eyes and went to sleep.  Ashley gently lowered her to the bed.<p>

“Time for part two.”, Ashley said as she placed her hands on baby Amber.<p>

Michael started recording once more as Ashley began transferring her age to Amber.  Baby Amber was growing larger quickly.  Soon she was toddler and then a 5 year old kindergartner.  Michael was watching his daughter grow up before his eyes.  At the same time Ashley was no longer in her twenties and was a teenaged girl once more.  Ashley’s breasts firmed up and then started shrinking as she regressed further back into her teens.  When Ashley paused in her transfer, she was now a child of 12 years old and so was Amber.  They looked like they could be sisters, Ashley with her blonde hair and Amber with her light brown hair like her fathers.<p>

“Look at me I’m a kid again”, giggled Ashley.  “Look at Amber she’s pretty.” Then she saw the small mounds on Amber’s chest.  “Hey she got boobies, I’m flat.”, frowned Ashley.<p>

Michael was slightly relieved that Ashley stopped and was a little confused.  “Did you change your mind about the whole womb experience?”, he asked.<p>

Ashley looked up at Michael, with her bright blue eyes, shook her head and smiled, “No silly, just wanted to see Amber before she’s bigger than me.”<p>

Amber was still sleeping as Ashley put her young hands back onto Amber’s stomach and closed her eyes.  One girl was growing up while the other little girl was growing even younger.  Amber became a teenager with puberty hitting her fast.  Ashley on the other hand, puberty was a forgotten memory as she was regressing into childhood.  Amber’s hair darkened slightly as she passed into high school age.  Meanwhile Ashley’s hair lightened as she grew closer to kindergarten age.  Baby fat began to appear on Ashley’s limbs as she shrank into early childhood.  When Ashley paused again, she was now 4 years old and Amber was 20.  Little Ashley crawled to the edge of the bed.<p>

“Mickey, give kiss kiss before I go bye bye.”, said Ashley with her arms up. She was acting more the age she appeared.<p>

Michael could not believe that this little toddler used to be his wife.  He carefully lifted her tiny body up into his arms and cradled her.<p>

“You soooo big now”, giggled Ashley, displaying all her baby teeth.  She then wrapped her small arms around Michael’s neck and gave him a wet kiss on the cheek.<p> 

Michael looked down at the toddler girl in his arms, “I love you so much”. He kissed Ashley on her forehead.  “I guess I’ll have to wait for nine months to see you again.”, he said as he kissed Ashley again.<p>

Feeling mischievous, Ashley quickly gave Michael a sloppy kiss on the lips.  “Love you too, time go bye bye now.”<p>
 
Michael lowered Ashley back to the bed and she crawled over to Amber.  Ashley spread Amber’s legs apart and sat between them.  Placing both her hands on Amber’s thighs, Ashley concentrated again.  It was hard to tell any changes in Amber’s appearance, but Ashley’s was more apparent.  She shrank down quickly into a baby girl of 12 months.  Michael, still recording, noticed that Amber’s breasts had started leaking milk.  When he went back to check up on Ashley, she was back to being a newborn infant.  He watched as a wet fleshly cord snaked its way from Amber’s birth canal and attached itself to Ashley’s bellybutton.   Once the cord connected, Michael noticed ripples of contractions on Amber’s stomach. Amber began moaning as Ashley was pulled feet first into her daughter’s vagina.  Each contraction brought Ashley closer to the womb.<p>

“My feet just past mommy’s, oops Amber’s cervix,” thought Ashley as she felt her feet push through a ring of muscle.  “Amber need shave”, she thought as her head got closer to Amber’s womanhood.  The pubic hairs started tickling her face as the lips began surrounding her head.<p>

Michael watched as one last contraction pulled his wife fully into is daughter’s womb.  There on the bed was his daughter Amber, nine months pregnant with his wife.<p>

Meanwhile inside the womb, Ashley was ready for the next part.  “Time to go back further, back to my beginning.”, she thought.  Tiny Ashley closed her eyes and started shrinking fast.<p>

Amber’s stomach was slowly shrinking down, melting like ice on a hot day.  With sadness, Michael continued to record his wife’s further regression in the womb of their daughter.<p> 

Once her stomach went flat, Amber opened her eyes and began moaning in pleasure, “Ohhhh oohhhh”.  She bucked her hips and was overwhelmed with her first orgasm.<p>

Inside the womb, a tiny sperm was slowly backing out of the egg.  Ashley was feeling herself separated into two parts. “Stop stop, not that far”, her conciseness thought.</p>
