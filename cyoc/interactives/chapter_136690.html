<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brittney went down the list of animals, there was so many to choose from but one stuck in her rather small mind. A dog. She loved dogs. Small ones, big ones, if it was a dog, she would love it. So the idea of a computer program sending her a dog, whatever dog she wanted, for free was perfect for her. No confusing credit card details that she would have to write down, no trying to sneak past her parents to grab their money out of their wallets and purses, no begging and pleading with them to get whatever she wanted (even though they would buy her plenty of things on a weekly basis), none of that. This was perfect for her. Then came the right side of the list, the part of the program she didn&#39;t understand. She went through all the options, scanning them over and over.<br />
<br />
The first option featured a word that she didn&#39;t understand. It sounded like &quot;Dana&quot; or &quot;Done-a&quot; but she couldn&#39;t make it out. The word was next to a percentage. 0%. Her flawed way of thinking thought that if she made it to 50%, the dog would appear in half the time. She wrote 50% in the text-box next to the percentage.<br />
<br />
Time:<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I want the dog ASAP, so I guess one minute...&quot; Brittney thought and proceeded to write one minute in the text-box.<br />
<br />
Pleasurable:<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasurable? For the dog? I want it to come here safe, so I guess?&quot; Brittney thought as she typed a single letter Y into the text-box.<br />
<br />
Alter Reality: <br />
<br />
&quot;As in make my parents think I&#39;ve always had the dog? YES! YES! YES, PLEASE!&quot; Brittney internally squealed and pressed the Y key as hard as she could into the text-box.<br />
<br />
Awareness:<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess?&quot; Brittney said, questioning why it needed awareness, as she typed Y into the text-box. She couldn&#39;t wait now, she wanted a dog and she wanted it fast. She had no regrets, no second thoughts, no nothing. She hit the enter key as soon as she finished.<br />
<br />
If she took that second thought, she would have noticed a few things. The top of the options had her name and details listed on there, explaining what was going to happen if she pressed enter. The word that she didn&#39;t understand was &quot;DNA&quot;. The DNA percentage was on 50%. And most importantly, she thought that she clicked on the dog option. It wasn&#39;t. She clicked on Donkey.<br />
<br />
A large flash covered her in blinding light, much like the previous scan she had before. The flash lasted a blink of an eye, leaving Mary confused about what happened. She looked around expecting to see a dog behind her, a tail wagging by the doorway, or at least to hear barks coming from the house, but nothing. No dog. &quot;Where the hell is my dog? Wait, I wrote down that it would come in a minute, didn&#39;t I?&quot; she thought &quot;Oh well, might as well look presentable for my new puppy!&quot;. She went into the nearest bathroom to do her makeup and any other things that she needed to do, unaware of the screen that popped up on her laptop, reading:<br />
<br />
Name: Brittney<br />
Transformation: Human to Donkey 50%<br />
Progress: 1%... 2%...<br />
<br />
Brittney was just combing her blonde hair when she felt something brush against her legs, something itchy scratching against her skin. She had a look and almost fainted at the sight of her legs growing hairs on her legs. She left her brush in the now tangled hair and tried to find something to get rid of it. She found her father&#39;s razor on the sink, and washed it under the sink. She turned back to her legs, only to see that the hair grew thicker, to the point where she couldn&#39;t see any part of skin on her legs. The hair was grey, a dirty grey. She dropped the razor in shock. Then she felt her hair spreading down, it felt like it was being pulled on by an angry child, to where it was growing down to her back. The brush stuck in the tangled hair begin to scrape against her now turning black hair. It was so painful, Brittney needed to shout, but a shout did not come out.<br />
<br />
&quot;HAAAAWWWWW!!!&quot; Brittney shouted. She then covered her mouth. Did that come out of her mouth? She sounded like a donkey. How was that possible? Her legs weren&#39;t the only place growing the hair, as it was spreading to her arms and chest. Brittney felt something moving behind her. She didn&#39;t move in case it was a spider, but the feeling didn&#39;t go away, it was still in the same place. It felt like it was growing. She had to turn and look. Carefully edging to look behind her, she saw something. It wasn&#39;t a spider. It was a tail. A tail that was attached to her. Her tail. The tail had the same hair growing around it, with a tuft of her now black hair at the end. &quot;HAAAAAWWW?!?&quot; she shouted again, covering her mouth in shock at the same sound that came out before. Her fingers went numb as she felt them. They became a lot stiffer and they were starting to turn a charcoal black, fur covering the rest of her hands. She tried to run to the phone, calling an ambulance surely would help, right? But as she turned even slightly, she tripped over as her shoes burst into ribbons, revealing what has happened to her feet. Hooves. Black hooves. Like a donkey. She picked herself off of the ground and looked in the mirror. The fur seemed to be covering up most of her face. She watched as her ears stretched and extended to inhuman lengths, raising them to the top of her head. She lifted her &quot;hands&quot; to feel them, and as she did, her ears flopped down. She felt them, she felt them droop onto her head. This was real. This was happening. She was turning into a donkey. She winced as her whole jaw pushed forward, her nose combining with her jaw as it stretched, her nostrils stretching and her teeth bulking, becoming yellow. The stretching stopped and she opened her eyes.<br />
<br />
She saw a mutant. A buck-toothed creature with donkey additions morphed together staring back at her. &quot;HAAAAAAAAAAWWWW!!!&quot; she screamed. She ran out of the bathroom to try and get her parents. Surely they would know the answer to why this was happening. As she left to find her parents, she tripped over her own hooves and fell, bouncing on the stairs as she came down and landed on the floor with a thump. Finally, she heard her parents try and find her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sweetie, are you okay?&quot; her mother asked.<br />
Okay? OKAY?! She was a donkey person, a beast creature, did she look okay?!<br />
&quot;MAAAWWWWM! LOOK AT ME! I&#39;VE- I&#39;VE TURNED INTO A DONKEY!&quot; she shouted at her parents.<br />
&quot;Turned?&quot; her father questioned.<br />
&quot;Honey, you have always been like this. I don&#39;t know why you are worrying about it&quot; her mother answered.<br />
&quot;NO I HAAAAAWWWVE&#39;NT! I&#39;M SERIOUS, LOOK AT ME, I HAVE A BLOODY TAIL!!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve always had that tail, ever since you were a little girl&quot; her father replied.<br />
She couldn&#39;t believe her donkey ears, they believed that she was always this... this thing!<br />
&quot;WHAT ARE YOU TAAAAWWWLKING ABOUT, I WAS NEVER A DAAAWWWWNKEY!&quot; she shouted at her parents.<br />
&quot;Listen, daring...&quot; her mother said, as she went closer to Brittney, slightly hugging her &quot;I know you seem different to all the other girls, but you are still our daughter and nothing will ever change that&quot;.<br />
&quot;MAAAWWWM! I HAVE NEVER BEEN A DAAAAWWWNKEY BEFORE IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE, WHY DO YOU THINK I AM ONE?&quot; Brittney shouted.<br />
&quot;Look, you can calm down now, we have only been trying to help!&quot; her father exclaimed.<br />
&quot;WHAAAAAWWWWT HELP?!? I&#39;VE BEEN TELLING YOU THAT I&#39;VE BLOODY CHANGED INTO A DAAAAAWWWNKEY, YOU HAVEN&#39;T HELP AT ALL!!!&quot; Brittney yelled.<br />
&quot;THAT&#39;S IT! Brittney, go to your room! We&#39;ve been trying to help you, but you haven&#39;t been listening!&quot; her father yelled.<br />
She couldn&#39;t believe it, her parents think she has always been a donkey and they won&#39;t even help her understand why. Brittney stomped back upstairs, upset. She went into her room, slammed the door, whimpered to her bed and cried.</p>
