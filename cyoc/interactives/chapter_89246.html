<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wonder who that is?&quot; Simon wondered as he made his way downstairs, putting on a towel he had left in his room. The door was knocked on again and the person talked this time. &quot;Hello?! Simon, its me!&quot; It was his girlfriend Janet. &quot;Oh crap,&quot; Simon thought to himself &quot;Why did it have to be someone I knew? Could have left it alone.&quot; Simon wondered when he realized something strange. &quot;Wait... Girlfriend? Since when have I liked girls?&quot; Simon thought for a second, then realized. &quot;G? Did that mean Gay&quot; Simon realized the mistake he made. &quot;Great. Now I have to change... Change? Wait!&quot; Just then Simon had a devious thought. &quot;Hmm. Maybe he&#39;s not home?&quot; &quot;Um... Wait! The door is open! Come on in!&quot; Simon yelled out trying to disguise his voice and he did it quite well. He went into the hall so he could ambush her. &quot;Geez. What took you so long to answer? I want to talk about something important.... Where are you...? Guess he&#39;s in his room.&quot; Janet proceeded to pass the hall and to the stairs and Simon took his chance and swung his hand to Janet&#39;s neck like in the movies. &quot;Ah!&quot; Janet fell down.<br />
<br />
Several hours later and Janet started to gain consciousness. Simon had went about readying the Chronivac and was all ready. &quot;Hmm.... Where am I?&quot; Janet had awoken and noticed herself tied to the bed and naked. &quot;What?! What the hell?!&quot; Janet looked up and saw a man near her. &quot;Ah! Ahhhhhh!&quot; Who are you?!&quot; &quot;Relax Janet. It&#39;s me Simon!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not stupid! Simon is my boyfriend! He&#39;s my age!&quot; &quot;You know you always had a fear of peanut butter after you chocked on it when you were ten.&quot; Simon knew something only her parents knew, though she had told Simon after they were one year together. &quot;How? How can you know that?&quot; &quot;I used this machine here. I was able to make myself twenty. Look I&#39;ll make myself 21&quot; Simon went to the Chronivac and set his age to 21. Not much changed. He grew about half an inch. His hair grew and changed around and his dick grew another half inch. It was just enough to get her attention. &quot;This can&#39;t be... But what are you going to do with me? Why am I hogtied to your bed? Why am naked?&quot; &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll you see, when I used this thing I set something called GBS to G. I didn&#39;t know what it meant at first, but I&#39;ve made my self Gay.&quot; &quot;Gay...?&quot; Janet uttered the word and realized it at once. &quot;Yeah so now I don&#39;t like girls now. So need to change somethings now so we can still go out. Isn&#39;t that great?!&quot; &quot;No! I like my body just the way it is! I.... Help! Help!&quot; Janet started yelling out. Simon new this might happen. &quot;Geez. Didn&#39;t want to do this.&quot; Simon took a pair of his underwear; he had used them to tie Janet.and out it in her mouth. &quot;Hmmdd. Hmmd.&quot; Now Janet was silent.<br />
<br />
Now Simon could make his work. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s a reality setting here. I can make it so the ew you can be normal. That way we won&#39;t have to feel guilt! Isn&#39;t that great?&quot; Janet continued to scream muffled yells. Tears formed in her eyes. &quot;Okay then. Simon took out Janet&#39;s settings. <br />

<br />
Okay then. I&#39;m so excited! Simon hit the start button and turned around. Janet was still struggling, but that all changed when the emitter hit her. It was then she started convulsing and froze. The changes were staring. It started with her blond hair. The hair jutted back into her head. The blond hair changed to a more dirty color. Her body started to move again and it started to change. Her dainty skin was starting to get rugged. The muscles stared to bulge out. Her feet grew from a small 7 feet into a huge 13 feet.Her toes lost their manicure. As the hair continued to go into her head, some started to appear on her skin, though not as much as Simon. Her prized Stomach inflated. Lines started to form as they depressed in her skin forming a nice 8 pack. Her neck started to bulge. And Simon could hear Janet&#39;s voice getting deeper ad deeper. Her hands did the same as her toes. Hair grew on the top as well. Besides the obvious parts, Janet looks indistinguishable from a man. That was to change completely though. Janet&#39;s breasts started to deflate. At the same time hair grew there to. As they deflated, they moved in all directions. The lumps became square until they became pecs. One more left. Janet&#39;s screaming turned to moaning. Simon noticed her clit started to get smaller. Then a dot came out, followed by what looked like a mushroom. The mushroom grew out and expanded and something cylindrical in shape came attached to it. That started to push out too and expanded. What followed was something wrinkled. The balls were forming. They squeezed out and grew hair. The penis was finally here. Like a snake it slithered out. Then it got erect. For some reason. &quot;Uh oh. Looks like changing to a different gender will do this to a person. &quot;Looks like I learned something new for science.&quot; As Simon fist pumped, Janet (Or should we call her George now?) convulsed again and her dick did the same, shaking until it all came out. The cum shot out fast, spurting all over Janet&#39;s body. Her dick shrunk again going back to its limp form. The transformation was over. Janet was still convulsing while Simon went back to himself and stopped his changes from going back to normal in 24 hrs. &quot;Good! All set!&quot; By then Janet... No... By then George had stopped convulsing. Simon went to him and took out the gag. He then proceed to untie the restraints which had already become loose from the struggle and muscle expanding. George twitched a little more, some more cum came out of his dick. Simon and looked at his dick and it was still erect, leaking pre-cum. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey George. How ya doing? &quot;Uhh... Uhhh... Simon. Where am I? And why am I naked and sticky?&quot; &quot;Well that&#39;s because...&quot; But by the the Chronivac has changed reality. Simon could no longer go back to the old days</p>
