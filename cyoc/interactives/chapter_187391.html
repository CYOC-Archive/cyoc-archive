<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Mark relieved himself into the urinal as well, he showed Matt and Calvin where the rest of Uriel was in the basement.<br />
<br />
They were greeted by the sight of Uriel´s body down from the neck hanging from the ceiling with Ashton standing just underneath him, teasing Uriel´s cock.<br />
But what surprised them was that if they didn´t know they were looking at a human body, they could easily think of it as a pipe with some extras.<br />
<br />
Ashton had readjusted how exactly Uriel was hung there when he had wired him up. By now, Uriel´s arms weren´t bond behind his back anymore as Mark remembered them, but were stuck to the ceiling to both sides, holding onto the pipes connected to the sink and the bathtub upstairs. They were tied up with ropes to them completely, only Uriel´s thumbs weren´t. Instead, they were covered in something white, most likely resin, so he couldn´t move them. It worked like a hook to both sides.<br />
<br />
Uriel´s torso was also wrapped tightly in ropes, down to his cock and balls, the only thing not wrapped. His legs were now bond together tightly as well, but something seemed to be in front of them, tied to them. The area right under Uriel´s ass was a bit rounder then normal, though. And the rope didn´t end at Uriel´s feet, which looked rather uncomfortable bound, as there was something going down there to the ground.<br />
<br />
As Ashton turned to them, he grinned at their surprised faces. “It looks like you crucified him, Ash.” Mark said in his surprise.<br />
“I think I have” Ashton answered causally. “It´s easier to hide the body if there is something next to it. We can even use the hooks up there to hang something up, they can hold up a couple kilos if needed.” At that, they all heard a low whimpering sound from above, showing that Uriel could clearly hear Ashton.<br />
<br />
Ashton flicked against Uriel´s balls to get him silent, before he continued: “I tied its arms to the other pipes, and they run along its back as an extra support. And here” he said, pointing towards the round shape beneath Uriel´s balls: “Connect the two pipes, as well as everything our urinal let flow out. We can connect this tube to the cock so he won´t spill a single drop. And even if he´s not teased by us, this cock-ring will keep him hard anyway. Also, if needed, we can just close this hatch to hide both its cock and balls from clear view. As you see, the bigger pipe runs down with its legs and feet, and continues down and out into the sewers.”<br />
<br />
As Ashton had finished his explanation to the trio by the entrance, he teased Uriel a bit more. The others had to agree, if you didn´t know what you were looking for, and if the hatch was closed, there wasn´t a reason you would see a human hanging there. Ashton had even painted the ropes holding him to fit the color of the pipes. <br />
<br />
“So, the only way to recognize that this was a human is its noises?” Mark asked his brother.<br />
<br />
“That, or knowing what to look for. I thought of the hooks as a way to hung up the laundry that doesn´t get into the drier, that would hide him even more. And it´s not as if many people will go in here without us knowing.” Ashton answered, and Uriel made another pitiful sound, getting another flick to keep him silent.<br />
<br />
“You know” Calvin started to say, “I know of something that could help keeping him silent.” At three sets of eyes turning to him and another whimper was heard from above, but this time Ashton didn´t punish the urinal. “In fact, out little urinal itself showed it to me, as he wanted for someone to shut up a bit. It´s a goo-like substance, that needs to be drunk. The drinker would be unable to speak or make any noises with his throat for a week afterwards, as it glues inside, blocking the drinkers voice-box. Maybe it still had some of it.”<br />
<br />
Mark´s eyes lit up with excitement. If their brother had, it would be his own punishment applied to him. “Did he ever use it?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah” Calvin said. “A classmate of his, who had the habit of interrupting conversations and always knowing everything, and Uri got it inside the water-bottle of that classmate. It was a really quiet week, as nobody had an idea why that classmate suddenly couldn´t speak. Uri explained it to me weeks later laughing, and saying he would use it on me if I was too loud. Let´s see if he likes it himself.” With that, Calvin laughed evilly, and a second later, Matt, Mark and Ashton joined in, while Uriel´s whimpers grew louder in panic. How could Calvin tell them about that?<br />
<br />
They all went looking through Uriel´s stuff in the corner of the basement, right beside his position. Mark and Ashton had put everything down here with the boxes it was in, to look through after the house was finished. Then they could decide what to keep, and what to threw away.<br />
<br />
When Matt found the bottle, nestled deep inside one of the boxes, they all read the instructions of it, grinning madly. Like Calvin said, the stuff would glue someone´s throat. Normally used, it helped if your throat was injured, calming its insides. But it also kept them silent, to help the healing. But what had them grinning like mad was that if used regularly over an extended period of time, it would become permanent, muting the user, with no way of getting its voice back. And to their luck, the bottle was nearly full still.<br />
<br />
“With this, we will get him to shut up.” Matt said triumphal exclaiming his glee. He had already decided to visit regularly, just so he could use his ex. Calvin thought the same already.<br />
<br />
When the four came into the bathroom, showing the bottle to Uriel, he whimpered even louder, panicking about it. But they showed no mercy, tilting the bottle inside the urinals bowl and making him drink the amount of a full glass of it. As they watched him, his whimpers grew quieter and quieter, until he fell silent, with wide open eyes, showing his panic.<br />
<br />
“We will make sure it gets it daily, just so we never have to hear him again.” Mark said with glee. They would enjoy their newfound silence.</p>
