<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Designed by Eileen&#39;s great-grandmother, Judith Spelstorm, the make-up case had originally been used it to petticoat her son when he displayed what she saw as too many boorish male habits. But, because of the magic Judith had worked into the case, and the make-up inside, it had done more than simply cure her son of his unwanted behaviours. Just as it had would magically grow, and stuff would later appear within, whilst the contents never ran out, nor aged, Judith&#39;s son ceased to be who&#39;d he&#39;d been born as. Forced to spend the summer as a girl, he&#39;d barely managed to get the case to himself, after he&#39;d learned his mother had no intention of letting him be a guy again, turn himself back, and hide the case up in the attic, where it had remained until his grand-daughter had discovered it.<br />
<br />
Now, as the magic from the case clouded their senses as the five girls giggled and talked about what to do to Ryan. Eileen still wanted to make him over to look like a poodle, Trudy with her weird obsessions with werwolves still wanted that, Jennifer laughed about how Mike would bed Ryan if he looked like Tootsie, Lilia voiced they should make him look like a tween girl, whilst Stacy inquired about whether Ryan&#39;s bud could get to third base. Oblivious to what was happening to them, and as to how to could easily hold the teenage boy down, they each dipped a hand into a case and a tube of lipstick, a stick for eye shadow, is held up to the light, as another takes a sponge, whilst someone takes a pencil, another some tweezers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, can we talk...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot; Ryan starts to ask, but never gets a chance as a silent consensus is reached amongst the five, someone grabbed his lower jaw, and lip gloss is used on his lips.<br />
<br />
At first, they appeared how they usually did. But, after a second application from the tube, they appear smaller, thinner, and satisfied with this, another applies a sponge to his face. Still feeling like he could talk his way out it, Ryan tried to tell them, &quot;Come on, this isn&#39;t funny any longer,&quot; but is ignored as Lilia squirted some goop from a bottle on the sponge and begins to rub it over his face.<br />
<br />
Eileen, meanwhile, had taken from the case a brush and comb. Careful not to disrupt what Lilia was doing, she started to run both through his hair. Within moments, Ryan&#39;s hair had started to take on volume, length, and as it spilled out from his head, grew down past his shoulders, the five giggled even more as from the neck up, Ryan looked less like a boy, but a tween girl. Reaching into the case, Trudy, after she&#39;d used some tweezers to permanently pluck his eyebrows, took out a pair of tiny earrings, and with ease, she pierced the boy&#39;s ears. Finding the whole thing uncomfortable, Ryan tried to wiggle away when he felt a tight, pinching sensation in his ear lobes, and unable to stop himself, he cried, &quot;Come on. Cut it...&quot; but what else he might had said was lost as he realised how his voice sounded.<br />
<br />
No longer that of a teenage boy&#39;s, it had now had the range and cadence of a ten year old girl. Scared by this, Ryan demanded, &quot;What did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
If any of the girls heard how his voice had changed, they gave no indication. Instead, finished with their make over of his head, each considered maybe stopping there. But then Eileen found some scissors, Trudy a couple razors, Lilia a bottle of skin conditioner, Jennifer some wash rags, and Stacy some brushes, nail clips and and a couple cases of powers, with an unspoken word, they set to work on him from the neck down. With unearthly precision, Eileen snipped away Ryan&#39;s damp shirt, board shorts, and underwear. After she&#39;d done this, and started to take off the boy&#39;s shoes, Trudy went to work with the razors, removing first his chest hair, next his arm and armpit hair, followed by his leg hair, and after a moment&#39;s consideration, the pubic hair around his junk, leaving him with a bald knob and body that would never grow hair again unless components from the case were used as what had been removed vanished.<br />
<br />
As Trudy worked, Eileen tossed away the scraps of the naked boy&#39;s clothes, as well as his shoes, Lilia rubbed the contents of the bottle over Ryan. Starting at his neck and working down, she was followed by Jennifer, who used the wash rages to really rub the stuff into his body. Giggling about his dick, which appeared smaller with out his pubic hair, they were guided by the magic as they grasped it and lubricated it with both the bottle of skin conditioner and a couple tubes found in the case. Thinking they would yank him off, that what had happened to his voice couldn&#39;t be too bad if what he believed was to happened took place, Ryan moaned, &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; but quickly switched tunes when what the two were doing took on a different feel as they pressed and kneaded his cock and folded his nut sack until both disappeared betwixt his legs, leaving behind a pinkish-white set of exterior genitals the girls were familiar with, whilst inside Ryan&#39;s body, the change went a step further and female interior reproductive organs formed.<br />
<br />
Whilst this occured, and Ryan whimpered and pleaded for them to stop, Stacy set to work on his hands, fingers, feet, and toes. Starting with a manicure, she softened the skin, trimmed and worked his nails and cuticules, and brushed a powder over his hands and fingers that made them not only look younger, but regressed them back to what was normal for a ten year old girl. Finishing that, she repeated the process on his feet and gave him a full pedicure until his feet also would not have looked out of place on the body of tween girl.<br />
<br />
When they&#39;d finished with his front, they flipped him over and started on his back. As Lilia and Jennifer worked his skin, Trudy searched the make over kit, Stacy cleaned up some what they&#39;d used so far, and Eileen returned holding what looked like a shirt. His body looking more and more like a girl&#39;s as the stuff he&#39;d been exposed to forced his height down to about four foot four and his weight to around sixty seven pounds, Trudy took from case a pair of tweezers and some red and white hair. Using to the tweezers to pluck at Ryan&#39;s tailbone, she smiled as sprinkled the hair over the area. Nothing happening at first, it was butt that changed first. Taking on a more animalistic appearance, his anus more visible, it was soon covered by a tail that was growning bushy red fur over most of it and white on the tip.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with the job they&#39;d done, each thought it looked more realistic than they&#39;d believed. Letting go of Ryan, who sat up and whimpered, &quot;What did you do to me,&quot; as his tail twitched back in forth in agitation, none of the girls replied as they admired their handywork.<br />
<br />
With a glance down at his now tween body, Ryan took in how pale pink his nipples were, and shuddered when he saw the smooth, flat skin and very faint hint of a cleft that indicated where his genitals now where. Whining out, &quot;How? Why? I don&#39;t want to be a girl. You need to undo this,&quot; he was taken by surprise when Eileen handed him the shirt and told him, &quot;You can wear this for tonight, River.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reality altering around them as they thought of Ryan less as they boy he&#39;d been and more as the ten year old he become, and someone Eileen had agreed to babysit for the evening, it was only Ryan who seemed unaffected. Pulling on the garment he&#39;d been offered, which turned out to be a soft, cotton, short-sleever sleeper shirt that had a pink neckline and a picture of two pastel coloured ponies on the front, he pulled his long, dishwater blonde hair out and tried to understand how they done what they&#39;d done, as well as think of way to get him to undo it. Thinking it had to have been somehow the make over kit, Ryan wanted to go to it, to see if he could find a way to change himself back, but was dismayed as Eileen closed it up, took it away, and returned sometime after emptyhanded.<br />
<br />
Mind focused on that the case was the answer to his problem, and how he might get it, River, unaware that he&#39;d stopped thinking of himself as Ryan, tried to come with an idea of how to find it and use it. Finding it hard as his mind began to regress, and shift to something more akin to that of a tween girl, River barely paid any attention as Stacy inquired, &quot;So, what should we do next?&quot;</p>
