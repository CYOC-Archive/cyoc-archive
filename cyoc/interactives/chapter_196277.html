<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Tomorrow, I get the ring,” Skylar said,<br />
“No, next week you get the ring,” you corrected,<br />
“Ugh, it’s so boring. You get to have all the fun while I…” Skylar complained, gesturing to her butt, “have to deal with this,”<br />
You took a look at Skylar’s backside. As you had wished, Skylar was walking around with a huge butt. And when you said huge, you meant huge. It was like two overinflated basketballs and attached them to her ass. They were genuinely gigantic. Her hips were also quite a bit wider than her shoulders. Her thighs were engorged too. What made it even better was you didn’t enlarge her frame. It was her usual, slightly above average frame, with a huge fat ass attached to it.<br />
You were pretty happy with your work. You instinctively gave her butt a light slap. Her butt jiggled a lot. She grabbed her ass to stop it jiggling so much,<br />
“Heyy!” She said, looking at you, “you don’t realise how weird it feels. It’s way weirder than being fat with a fat ass. I’m skinny with a fat ass…” she paused, looking at your ass, “god I wish you had an ass this big,”<br />
You chuckled, lifting your hand to show her the ring, stuck exclusively to your finger.<br />
<br />
You and Skylar had decided to go out on a little ‘date’, if you could even call it that. It was basically just window-shopping at the mall. When it came down to it, you and Skylar limited spending with the ring. Unlimited power meant unlimited money, but you both agreed that using the ring to buy smaller things was unfair to the rest of the world. Unless something was super expensive, then you’d usually wish for it.<br />
<br />
“Why exactly do you get to have it until next week?”<br />
“Because you decided to turn my nipples into dicks without asking,” you answered,<br />
“Yeah… well…” she hesitated, “that’s not even that bad…” she said,<br />
“I could’ve been funny, if you didn’t start jacking them off while I was asleep,”<br />
“That’s…” she stopped, “I guess that’s fair,” she said,<br />
“But you can have the ring next week,” you commented, making sure Skylar didn’t lose all hope, “and that’s a promise,” you said, winking at Skylar. The ring shimmered after you said promise. The ring likes to keep to promises, always delivering when someone makes one.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Skylar almost shouted, startling you. She grabbed you and diverted your path around a corner,<br />
“W-what?” You said, confused,<br />
“It’s Cara and Bella…”<br />
“Wait, really!?” You said, peaking your head around the corner.<br />
<br />
She was right. Skylar’s old ‘friends’, Cara Lawrence and Bella DeLong. <br />
Cara was a red haired white girl. She was pretty average height, only a little taller than Skylar. She didn’t have particularly outstanding curves, but did have a nice shape to her body. She was objectively pretty, but you never liked her. She was always just… bitchy.<br />
Bella, the ‘second in command’ to Skylar. Or at least the old Skylar. Now that Skylar had essentially left that group, Bella was most likely to take charge, become the leader of the group. She was a very tall, black girl, who notoriously had the largest bust of the group. She was definitely the tallest of the group, being only slightly shorter than you, literally only by a few inches. <br />
<br />
“Well well, if it isn’t Yu Protagist,” Bella said, immediately noticing your wavy hair,<br />
“Shit…” you said, you look at Skylar,<br />
“I’m not going out there!” She says, pushing you out into the open, distracting them from her,<br />
“Wait why are— oh hey!” You said awkwardly,<br />
“What do you mean, ‘oh hey!’ like we’re friends,” Bella said, confrontationally,<br />
“And who’s behind there?” Cara asked, trying to move past you to see. You stuck your hand out, blocking her path,<br />
“Let’s not do this right now,” you said,<br />
“Excuse me?” Bella said, standing up straight, “who do you think you are, telling us what to do?”<br />
“I think I’m exactly who you think I am,” you said, semi-sarcastically,<br />
Bella scoffed at you, “you think you’re funny?” Bella said, “let me guess, your queer friend decided to ‘play for the other team’?” Bella remarked, insulting one of your best friends, Emily. Cara snickered at her friends’ joke.<br />
<br />
“I said it before,” you started, getting a little heated, “let’s not go there,” you said. Standing your ground.<br />
“Fine,” Bella said, “but please, whoever that is. Show yourself,” she said, looking into the corner.<br />
You looked, you could see Skylar cowering in the corner, not wanting to be seen in the state she was in,<br />
“I’m afraid that’s not gonna happen, Bella,” you said, not wanting to make a fight out of this, but also not giving up.<br />
<br />
Before anyone else could speak, Cara made a dash to get past you. You quickly jumped to the side to stop her from getting past, protecting your girlfriend from embarrassment. You grabbed Cara and held her in place, lucky she was short. You looked to your right and saw Bella creeping towards Skylar. You couldn’t make it there in time, so instinctively,<br />
“I wish Bella stops moving,” you said under your breath.<br />
Suddenly, Bella’s whole body stiffened. Her dark skin looked… tighter. Her arms, her legs, they began to shift from human skin to a dark marble. Her clothes stayed exactly the same on her frozen body,<br />
“Let me past!” Cara complained. She looked to her left, seeing her friend suddenly petrified in place. Her eyes went wide, “oh my god!” She shouted. You quickly covered her mouth,<br />
“Oh shit,” you said, “uhm, I wish Cara forgets that Bella is made of stone, and Bella goes back to where she was standing,”<br />
<br />
And like that, Cara’s mind seemed to draw a blank, her eyes shimmered as the wish took place. She looked completely empty for a moment. Enough time for you to move her back to where she was standing before. Bella’s frozen body slid from near Skylar, back to where she was standing before. But she was still made of marble,<br />
“I wish Bella is… made of flesh and bones again,” you said, not quite knowing how to phrase it. You’re hoping it didn’t do anything wrong when she returned. Her body became a lot squishier again, back to her normal, human, non-statue based form.<br />
<br />
“W-wow… why is it so cold…” she said, grabbing her arms, “my body feels so stiff…” she said to herself,<br />
“What just happened?” Cara asked.<br />
<br />
“hey!” Skylar whispered, getting your attention. You quickly wandered over, “yeah?” You asked<br />
“What are you doing, why don’t you just wish they didn’t notice you or something…”<br />
“I thought we agreed on no time-travelling wishes?”<br />
“Well that’s different, make them forget or—”<br />
<br />
“You better tell us who you’re talking to!” Bella demanded,<br />
“And explain what the hell is going on!” Cara said, still slightly confused,<br />
“Alright, alright,” you started, “the only thing I can—”<br />
Then suddenly. You were interrupted…</p>
