<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Within five-minutes of the transformation taking place, Dylan found himself wearing a pair of little girl's white panties with tiny pink, purple and yellow hearts and one of Michelle's nighties since he couldn't stop yawning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what should your name be?&quot; asked Karen looking through her copy of the previous years' year book.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you change me back and let me be who I was before that stupid medallion was found,&quot; Dylan said with as much force as his tiny voice would allow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be silly, sis.  I'll find you the perfect name.&quot;  Dylan stared angrily up at his sister.  &quot;Ah ha,&quot; said Karen turning hastily at her brother.  &quot;Catherine Elisabeth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so, Karen.  You are going to change me back this instant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting her finger up to her chin as if she were thinking deeply, Karen turned back around and picked up the medallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;So demanding are we.  I guess I'll have to show you,&quot; she said breaking the medallion in half like it were a thin piece of wood.  &quot;You see, squirt, I've done my research.  After being used, the medallion becomes frail for a period of an hour and if it is broken within that time, the medallion becomes a normal piece of jewelry and it loses it's magical properties.  In addition to this, the last transformation it does becomes permanent and no amount of magic or magical items can undo it.  Now you're stuck that way...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing this, Dylan began to cry hysterically.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright, Catherine, just lay down for your nap and I'll take care of everything, don't you worry your precious, little head,&quot; said Karen pulling her brother closer in a tight hug.  &quot;You can even take it here in my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
'A nap does sound like a good idea,' thought Dylan as his sister wiped away his tears.<br />
<br />
<br />
As Dylan fell quietly asleep beneath his sister's covers, his sister went quickly to work throwing away his old clothes, calling her friends about having them pick-up some cute little outfits for him and notifying their parents about the changes, so when they got home they wouldn't go crazy.<br />
<br />
At first, when she told her mother over the phone what happened, her mother freaked, but after ten-minutes of talking with her, her mother calmed down and began to accept the idea of having a second daughter now instead of a teenage son.  Next came telling her father what happened, but surprisingly, he was just fine with the idea since Dylan was more of a trouble-maker than he cared to admit.  The only issue he had with the transformation was who was going to keep an eye on their new six-year-old child, but Karen hastily assured him that she'd be more than happy to keep an eye on her little sister.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waking up, Dylan momentarily forgot about what happened as he rolled off his sister's bed and it wasn't until he looked down at his tiny feet that no longer hit the floor that he remembered what happened.  Instantly he began to cry again, causing Karen to run across the hall to her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong, Catherine?&quot; she asked with a bewildered but amused look across her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think is the problem?&quot; he said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; responded Karen snapping her fingers and grabbing hold of his tiny hand, pulling him back into his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are they doing here?&quot; asked Dylan seeing Karen's two best friends standing in his room and going through four large bags filled with little girl's outfits and two large bags filled with room decorations and three cans of light pastel pink paint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your big sister invited us over to help her with all the preparations you're going to need,&quot; said Megan while Karen and Hannah chuckled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That night, as Dylan watched helplessly, Hannah, Megan, and Karen began the transformation work on his room.  First went his bed and dresser.  Then after careful consideration, Karen decided that the lite gray carpet wouldn't harm her crazy plans about doing his room.  Next came his posters of half naked women and the calender his friend Michael had bought him from playboy.  Last to go were his computer and television.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the time the three girls finished on Sunday afternoon, Dylan's room wasn't even recognizable any longer.  His walls were pink with wall nets filled with stuffed animals and different toy dolls just within his arm's reach.  In addition to this, his bed now had a pink canopy with the words princess written in cursive and the bed sheets where covered with Walt Disney's Princess designs.  His desk lamp was now also a Walt Disney Princess designed with matching curtains hanging in front of his windows.  His dresser was now half its original size with pink nobs and a pink top.  Inside each of the draws, a new item for him to explore (Top draw: Panties, Middle draw: Cami's and socks, Third draw: Slips and Tights).  But these weren't the only changes they did of course, they also emptied his closet and piled in all the new clothes along with brand new school uniforms.  However, when Dylan looked inside, there were no signs of any pants or shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;We only have one last thing to worry about,&quot; said Megan and Karen together and looking at Dylan.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Dylan confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ears, squirt.  You're going to have your ears pierced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan just looked back at them, frightened beyond both fear and words.</p>
