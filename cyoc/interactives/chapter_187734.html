<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Awareness came back to Kenendy in concert with a sound of tearing metal and a powerful suction force upon her arm. Her eyess flew open, mind drowsy for just a moment before a joly of electricty ran through it, shocking her back into being fully alert. The last memory of what she&#39;d been doing before blacking out came roaring back, and a good thing too - it did a lot to explain why she was sitting in her fighter among some kind of latex-covered bay, watching as a futa ripped the canopy off and grabbed her rod, eager to pump transformative, sticky globules all over the pilot&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
That definitely wasn&#39;t going to fly. In a panic Kennedy hurled herself off to one side, a surprising amount of physical force allowing her to completely clear her seat before any of the mutation-inducing juices could touch her. She expected to need a breath after that, but instead found no fatigue... not even muscles to feel contigue in. Just synthetic fibers to imitate the real thing - and that weren&#39;t vulnerable to the Futas&#39; assimilation. The potential existential dread over how much of her flesh had become machinery, and whether or not she&#39;d ever be able to properly feel Shali&#39;s tail rubbing her leg, was secondary to the immediate issue.<br />
<br />
Swinging around, the Futa once again tried to land a hit on the pilot, and once again she found herself dodging almost effortlessly - the latex creature almost seemed to be moving in slow motion, such was the state of her newly-enhanced reflexes. Good, good, could keep ahead of that monster. That only left her wondering how the hell she was supposed to kill this thing... and as if on cue, she found her arms tingling in response to another change. From the top of each forearm, a pair of blades jutted out through her flight suit, shimmering tristeel weapons that glinted with a molecular edge. Oh. Oh that&#39;d do nicely. God, that beautiful feline really did think of everything.<br />
<br />
Continuing to dodge around the spurts of gooey cum, she closed in, waiting until she was practically on top of the futa to strike. For the sake of mercy - and her own limited time - it was a quick thing. Both blades stuck deep into the creature&#39;s gut, penetrating a latex skin that most knives and bullets just bounced off of. There was one last gurgle from her mouth, a mixture of liquified latex and blood that was approaching the same green color as her skin, before the creature fell backwards, collapsing as the sheer trauma overcame the regenerative capabilities of her bonded latex and flatlined her. A damn shame, having to kill someone who was just another victim - but it had to be done.<br />
<br />
There were no other futas around at the moment - most not have been able to respond immediately to their sister being in peril. It gave her a chance to take stock of her surroundings: some kind of cargo bay, filled with trophies and debris from the recent attack on the fleet. Lots of containers filled with, she assumed, some of their rubbery munitions, as well as fuel, and various little latex cubes - power sources, she&#39;d heard about those, formerly people who the assimilation process had screwed up on, now nothing more than batteries living in eternal orgasm. The thought would&#39;ve made her shudder if she still had that capacity.<br />
<br />
Speaking of, she might as well see what had become of her own body. Quickly the pilot ripped off her now-ruined flight suit, before deciding to go all the way, tossing off her uniform underneath and even her underwear. Stark naked, Kennedy stepped over to a highly reflective, almost mirror-like panel, and gasped with both surprise and arousal at her reflection. Her entire body was covered in a shiny, glistening chrome, the smooth metal covering everything from head to toe, even her hair having a layer of the stuff over it. Her all-silver eyes couldn&#39;t help but fall with admiration onto the way her physique had been altered, too, with her synthetic muscles now appearing toned and powerful, her glinting lips plump and kissable... and her chest and hips wider than before, giving the cyborg an hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
That last bit was <i>definitely</i> a personal touch by Shali... not that Kennedy was complaining.<br />
<br />
Just as she thought of of the catgirl, that artificial voice again blared in her head. &quot;Congratluations: the conversion process is now complete. Playing recording...&quot;<br />
<br />
Within the HUD that was broadcast right into her vision, a window popped up showing Shali, wringing her hands but smiling into the camera. &quot;Hey Kennie. If you&#39;re watching this, well... that means the plan worked, but... I didn&#39;t get to explain everything before sending you out. So... I&#39;m sorry, that you&#39;re not getting to ask me questions in person, but... hey, gives you an even better reason to come back to me alive, huh?&quot; She laughed weakly. &quot;Listen, this project... it... it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve been working on with anybody else. Kinda... kinda my own thing, because... I&#39;d have never gotten approval. And... I&#39;m sorry, because chances are I lied to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those cute whiskers twitched. &quot;I probably told you that it&#39;d make you a cyborg, which is... kind of true. Your whole body&#39;s been replaced, Kennie - if I got it right, you&#39;re a brain in a souped-up battlesuit.&quot; She seemed ashamed, but truth be told? Kennedy wasn&#39;t that bothered. She&#39;d always figured a robot body would be cooler than plain old boring flesh and blood - and she was right. &quot;But... that&#39;s not all. You know as well as I do, trying to fight the Futas conventionally won&#39;t work. Too many of them, not enough of us. So I realized... we need to learn from them. Turn their own tricks back on them. You probably figured out the blades already, but there&#39;s something else you can do.&quot; <br />
<br />
With a quiet hiss, flexible metal tubes extended from each of Kennedy&#39;s wrists, snaking out into view. &quot;You&#39;re not just a cyborg superwoman. You&#39;re a walking nanite factory. You can&#39;t produce a lot, just enough per day to convert one futa... but then they can convert more... and they can convert even more... and so on. I call it counterassimilation. I ah, I haven&#39;t had a chance to test it on a live Futa yet, but... I have a feeling that if it&#39;ll work for anybody, it&#39;ll work for you.&quot; The catgirl smiled faintly. &quot;So... get out there, you big, stupid, wonderful primate... and then come back to me. I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The message shut off, and Kennedy whispered back a simple response. &quot;Love you too.&quot; Her head swiveled around to the Futa she had &#39;killed&#39; - already it was getting back up again, the ship having revived her to go after the one who&#39;d so briefly ended her life. As she charged, though, Kennedy didn&#39;t get out the blades, but instead readied the tubes, leaping forward and sinking them into the alien hybrid&#39;s chest. No better time than the present to test this out - she just hoped, as tendrils of grey began slinking out across the Futa&#39;s skin, that her girlfriend&#39;s hare-brained little counterassimilation scheme was going to work.</p>
