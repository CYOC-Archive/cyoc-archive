<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So you are fine with being bald for the initial turning?&quot; Mark asked her.<br />
&quot;I should be able to get it back once I am all latex, so it won&#39;t be an issue. If I can&#39;t, though, then there is a wig in there which accompanied these.&quot; Amy replied, lifting up her giant tits to refer to the bra that made them.<br />
&quot;Speaking of, you want nipples or something on those?&quot; Both of them had kind of forgotten them in the middle of all this.<br />
&quot;Maybe later. I actually really like them like this. They are so round, smooth and feels so arousing to play with.&quot; Amy rubbed her hands up and down, her head turning an ever deeper red as she fondled herself.<br />
&quot;And aren&#39;t nipples extra sensitive comparatively? But I digress.&quot; Mark pulled out the ski mask which they would use for the next step. &quot;So, who&#39;s the bank robber?&quot; They both chuckled at his question.<br />
&quot;Me, I guess. Found it amongst my clothes, but don&#39;t know when or where I got it.&quot; She took the headwear from Mark. She put it on and tucked her hair inside it. Then the tingling started and the mask turned into the latex black as Amy lost her hair, ears and nose, only her eyes and mouth, with a small amount of skin around those parts remaining. She took a look at her reflection in Mark&#39;s closets mirror doors. The few human parts of her was a bit off putting to her, but she generally liked her smooth round head. &quot;Almost done.&quot; She couldn&#39;t hold back a grin. &quot;Also, putting the mask on reminded me of where we got it. Canceled skiing trip last year. Followed with a ski jacket, mouth scarf and ear protectors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Seems like overkill.&quot; Mark replied. Amy made a notion for him to speak louder. &quot;I hope you are joking, Amy.&quot; The latex girl pouted.<br />
&quot;You are no fun, Mark.&quot; She hoped to tease a bit, but if he was going to be serious, there was no point.<br />
&quot;Just want to be sure. Could be you would get second thoughts turning your eyes and mouth.&quot; While he had fun seeing Amy transform into a latex woman, and was fascinated by the entire thing, he didn&#39;t want her to end up regretting it, though he was pretty sure that Amy would go through with this thing even if she would.<br />
&quot;Bah, if I were to be deaf or blind, then so be it.&quot; Amy was dismissive of the whole thing. She was so close to live out that kink which had plagued and turned her on for months. She was ready to sacrifice anything to fulfill it. &quot;Seriously.&quot; she continued. &quot;Let this be a last request in case everything goes wrong. If I am to become completely inanimate, with me being trapped in this latex body, then you are allowed to use me however you want. And yes, that means using me a sex doll as well. I mean, that is what we are going for, after all. Of course that means, that if my mind also vanishes that those same conditions apply. I will just be an object with certain uses. The only thing I ask of you is that you actually use me.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. It sounds kind of wrong.&quot; Mark replied, though, something deep inside him found the idea of Amy&#39;s mind trapped in a sex doll arousing.<br />
&quot;How much different would it be than if I just started to pretend to be inanimate forever?&quot; Amy was not letting up.<br />
&quot;Fair enough.&quot; was Mark&#39;s only reply, having to give that point to her.<br />
<br />
Amy took some eyeshadow and covered her eyelids and the surrounding skin. She could feel the now all too familiar tingling as the burning turned it to latex. Her eyes, themselves, were still organic, though. She took some contacts she had leftover from a costume and placed them on her eyes. She could feel the burning as her eyes turned. She tried to look around, but quickly realized she had to turn her head to do that. She looked in the mirror to see her eyes being the same blue as the contacts were, but the blue covered the entire eyeball. That together with lacking ears and a nose, in combination with her feet made her look alien. She then turned to Mark. &quot;How do I look?&quot;<br />
&quot;Weirdly hot.&quot; he replied.<br />
&quot;Okay, so give me the lipstick so we can seal the deal.&quot; Amy was ready for the finale. She could almost taste it.<br />
&quot;Before we do that, how about we plan the dollifying phase first?&quot; Mark asked. Amy was about to object on the stalling, but realized that it might be a good idea to plan ahead because of her going mute. She agreed to the idea and they started planning.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good.&quot; answered Mark as they had concluded. &quot;Moisturizer and your lipstick, my doll.&quot; he offered with a poor English accent.<br />
&quot;Thank you, can&#39;t go around without a nice head shine, now can I?&quot; replied Amy in a slightly less poor accent. She took the cream and smeared it all over her head and carefully around her mouth. In no time at all, her entire head was as shiny as her body with only her lips reminding the duo that she originally was a human. She then stepped closer to Mark in a quick motion, grabbed the back of his head, and pulled it in for a kiss. Mark was taken aback at first, but quickly returned the gesture. After a few minutes of this, Amy pulled out. &quot;A final gift to you.&quot; she said as she transitioned her voice into the most sexy and sensual voice she could make. &quot;The last kiss I can give with my original mouth. This wouldn&#39;t have been as fun as it was without you.&quot; She removed the lid of the lipstick.<br />
&quot;You make it sound like once it is done that you will just leave or disappear forever.&quot; Mark said, worried about what Amy had said.<br />
&quot;Well, to be fair,&quot; Amy started, still using the sexy voice, as she ran the lipstick across her lips. &quot;my voice will be in a few seconds.&quot; The burning had already sat in as Amy&#39;s lips filled up a little making them more primed for kissing than before, turning the same pink as her pussy, and turned the insides as well, into latex.<br />
&quot;God this feels amazing.&quot; Amy mouthed as no voice came out. She tried to say it again. Still nothing. She tried to say any sound, but there was only silence. Her voice was gone for good.<br />
&quot;That is that, I suppose.&quot; Mark said. Amy nodded in agreement. &quot;Though, you not being able to talk can become a bit problematic.&quot; Amy just handwaved it. &quot;So, shall we see if you can revert?&quot;<br />
Amy concentrated, and almost instantly her hair sprung out, although it had turned into the same pink as her mouth and pussy. She moved her fingers between the strands, noticing that each hair was just as thin as they normally were, but she was unable to pull even a single strand out. Mark just looked as the busty latex girl tried to tear her hair out. He was amused by the sight.<br />
After a few more attempts, Amy gave up and turned towards Mark as her hair vanished about as fast as it sprouted. She made a motion to tell him she was ready to be dollified.</p>
