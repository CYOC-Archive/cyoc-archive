<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up and tried to stand up, but you saw a weird fabric type thing pulling you down. You tripped and fell on the ground flailing your entire body, and you freaked out noticing that your feet were talons, and your arms were wings. You eventually tore apart the fabric of your prison and stood up, and instinctively flapped your wings and flew up and hovered in place for a few moments before landing on a perch that you saw was in the room moments before.<br />
<br />
You took a moment to catch your breath after your freak out and you turned around on your perch to see Ozzy looking at you. The two of you stared awkwardly at each other for a few moments then Ozzy finally said,&quot;You can talk you know, all familiars can.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh that&#39;s good to know, but I really don&#39;t know what to say in this situation.&quot; You said then paused for a moment,&quot;Actually no, I know exactly what to say, what am I?!&quot; You yelled and your voice cried out like a call from a hawk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your a hawk, specifically a red-tailed hawk. Judging by your immediate reaction you aren&#39;t very familiar with magic are you?&quot; Ozzy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on to a major extent, so I just panicked. There&#39;s that and the fact that I was trapped in my shirt.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose those are both valid reasons, but personally my patience for ignorance is like a sleeping dragon, poke it lightly and it may continue to sleep, but tempt fate and your life is on the line. I also expect you to be at least decently respectful of me, that is as my familiar.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
You noticed a look of loss and dread in Ozzy&#39;s eyes, so in response you said,&quot;Hey, I know what you said and all, but who exactly are you? All I know about you is that you&#39;ve lost a relative that you hold dearly close to you, and by judging the tower condition I can assume that was rather recent. So, please if nothing else just let me know you, your past.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ozzy then gave you a glare then he sighed and said,&quot;Very well, but you need to know your place first, understood?&quot; You nodded and looked at Ozzy ready to listen and he began,&quot;You are a familiar, a being that does not age and is eternally loyal to a master. In this case your master is me, and your life is bound to mine. What that means is that if I die you will to, making my life just as, if not more important than yours. I have to say I&#39;m not quite sure why your body has chosen this form, but we must use it to our benefit.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;What about that ranting earlier about me becoming a dragon, or a griffin earlier?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;That is no longer possible for you, no transformation spell will effect you now. It is also worth mentioning that although I could teach you magic, I am just a graduate and nothing more. Teaching you this early is impossible for me, and I didn&#39;t quite think that you would become a hawk of all things.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have against hawks?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, I was just hoping for something that could fight on equal level with a human being.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I could always fly, and survey the area for you, and I&#39;m not as big as a dragon or griffin so I can do that rather inconspicuously, if that&#39;s the right word.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so, but I&#39;m going to have to teach you some magic eventually to make you more useful, not to offend you or anything.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, I understand you completely there. Still what exactly could I do as your familiar?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything I ask of you, and you will be required to follow my orders exactly. I will then take care of you, but not like a slave, or at least since you&#39;re with me.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Please be considerate with what orders you give me Ozzy.&quot; You said and Ozzy shot you another glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize that what you just called me brings back so many repressed memories.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh, sorry I forgot about that. Should I just call you something formal like sir, or master?&quot; You asked, and Ozzy nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but I don&#39;t really deserve the title &#39;master&#39; yet. If you don&#39;t mind, can your allow me to get a closer view of you?&quot; Ozzy asked and you nodded, and left your perch, and landed on a shelf next to Ozzy.<br />
<br />
Ozzy examined your body closer, and checked everything from your head to your tail feathers. Ozzy lifted both of your wings too and checked everything thoroughly. Ozzy then took three fingers and gently petted your head, and you bowed it when he did and he scratched your chin and you felt your mouth open in satisfaction. When Ozzy stopped he gave you a subtle smirk, and said,&quot;Wait here I have something for you.&quot; Ozzy then left the room and he returned later with a large birdcage that was just big enough for you to move around in. The cage had a large nest on the floor and a water bottle that was like one a hamster would have as well as a perch alongside the nest.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is yours now, and you will use it as it&#39;s use is intended to be used. Now come with me to where we&#39;ll be quartered.&quot; Ozzy said and you nodded and flew onto Ozzy&#39;s shoulder, and he gave you a weird look<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured that it would be easier this way, because I would be shifting the weight of the cage.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that&#39;s a fair point.&quot; Ozzy said and he walked out of the room, and into a corridor with a spiral staircase, but turned left right before it, and into a room with a single straw bed, with several bookshelves filled with books, and papers. Ozzy set your cage down on an end table a few feet from the bed, and you thought it was for the best so he would accidentally knock your cage down with you inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s upstairs?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;My great aunt&#39;s room, please honor her memory for me by never going up there unless you are accompanied by me.&quot; Ozzy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood sir,&quot; you said and Ozzy lowered you to your cage and you stepped inside of it. Ozzy then shut the cage door and latched it behind you, and you layed down in the pre-made nest, and you looked up at him. &quot;So what do you wish to be addressed by?&quot; Ozzy asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Like my name? Do I need a new name?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, all familiars are required to adapt to new names along with bodies.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then,&quot; you said then thought for a few moments,&quot;There&#39;s not really any good names for a bird that I know, or at least that aren&#39;t original. How about Keen, because I&#39;m a hawk?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, you said earlier that you wanted to know more about me, so I think that I should know more about you. I will tell you my story, and then you tell me yours.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;But are you sure? My story isn&#39;t for the weak-hearted so answer at your own risk.&quot; Ozzy said<br />
<br />
You thought for a moment then answered....</p>
