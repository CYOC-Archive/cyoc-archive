<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julie Stovall woke in her cell to see a large were-grizzly staring at her. Instantly recognizing the were is Sheriff Cooper; Julie rolls her eyes, “What do you want Sheriff?”<br />
“Just for you to confirm what you said earlier to me,” Douglas looking stoic; “when you got apprehended in Seattle with Alyssa-“<br />
“I told you,” Julie interrupting; “I don’t remember where the house was.”<br />
“I’m not asking about the house,” Douglas responding; “did at any time my cousin say any name other than Betty?”<br />
“No,” Julie answering; “why are you asking me this?”<br />
“And your certain she was a black furred were-cat,” Douglas stating.<br />
“Why are you asking me this,” Julie speaking; “what possible reason do you have to ask me questions you have the answers to?”<br />
“Brian Walker,” Douglas answers; “did you know that my cousin was steering that were-otter towards a life of being a gigolo?”<br />
Julie looks taken aback from that; “well that news to me. But again why are you asking me this?”<br />
“I’m asking these questions because I feel Brian my not be telling me everything regarding my cousin,” Douglas is speaking; “like the night he had his foray as a gigolo Thursday of last week during the blackout storm we had. The were-cat he swears was brown furred and is certain that Betty is an alias, I believe is the same Betty that turned you and my cousin over to the Luna Brotherhood.”<br />
“Okay,” Julie answering; “but I don’t know what else I could tell you other than what I know.”<br />
“Please,” Douglas responding; “think very hard, do you remember anything else that could help me find this Betty?”<br />
“And why should I help you,” Julie looking annoyed; “what’s in it for me?”<br />
“Closure,” Douglas answers; “while you may not care for me, I know you want revenge for what Betty did you foil your bid for freedom.“ Douglas staring at the wer-mer, “I can get it; revenge for you, justice for Alyssa. And her son.” Sheriff Cooper stares at Julie to let that last bit sink in before continuing; “Alyssa’s son is five years old and is on his way here from Burbank.”<br />
“I never knew Alyssa had a kid,” Julie looking befuddled.<br />
“Neither did I,” the sheriff responding; “Tachibana who found me at home crying told me before dragging my ass here to the council building. She was worried I might do something stupid”<br />
“Who’s the father,” Julie asking.<br />
“Don’t know,” Douglas answering; “but your father Martin, he’s on the short list as a possibility.”<br />
“No fucking way,” Julie looking shocked; “if that is true-“ Julie thinking; ‘then my parents’ marriage would be over. No way will mom ever forgive dad for fathering another child, let alone with Alyssa.”<br />
“It would be the death of your parent’s marriage,” Douglas answering; “<br />
<br />
Julie was silent for a few minutes. Thinking on what the sheriff just said and what was revealed in conversation. She closes her eyes for a few minutes and tries to recall anything that could help both herself and possibly the sheriff seeking revenge for the both of them. Thinking back Julie sees Alyssa lifeless corpse staring at her on the forest floor. Trying to get the image out of her mind and go back farther but unable to she looks at the sheriff.<br />
“All I can recall is the werewolf ripping Alyssa’s throat out.”<br />
“Try harder Julie,” Douglas speaking; “think of before you got caught by the Luna Brotherhood. Is there anything you may have seen? A name on a door mat, a mailbox, unopened letter on a table?”<br />
<br />
Julie thinks for a few more minutes. Recalling the kitchen of Betty’s house as she and Alyssa grabbed a bite to eat. Spying an unopen letter on the table and seeing the Betty on it as well as a last name.<br />
“Betty Van Rosenberg,” Julie blurts out.<br />
“Are you certain,” Douglas Copper answers.<br />
“It was on some mail,” Julie speaking; “A utility bill from the looks of it. I saw the name just before Betty slapped handcuffs on me and decked Alyssa before handcuffing her.”<br />
The were-grizzly looking stoic before standing up and then grinning; “If your lying-“<br />
“I have no reason to lie,” Julie answering; “if this helps you get justice for Alyssa, then it helps me get revenge on what happened to me.”<br />
“What reason do you have for talking to my client Sheriff Cooper?”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Copper turns around to see a were-badger quickly approaching; clearly snarling despite the fact that Douglas Cooper was three times her size.<br />
“Your client witnessed my cousin’s murder” Douglas growling; “so back off. Or you’ll find out what happens when you poke a bear with a stick!”<br />
Brett Smithson not intimidated with Douglas’s sheer size in his fursona just growls; “I’ve been threatened by a lot bigger and a lot uglier. Try hard harder!”<br />
“I’m done here anyway;” Douglas looking at Julie and giving her a subtle nod before walking off. “Good luck getting your client the lightest sentence possible; with murder and an escape hanging over Julie’s head, I wouldn’t be surprised if she received three back to back to back life sentences.”<br />
<br />
Julie watches as the large were-grizzly lumbers away, before looking back at Brett as she asked her a question.<br />
“What was the sheriff asking you without me present?”<br />
“Questions regarding Alyssa Cooper’s death,” Julie telling the truth; “the sheriff wanted more information regarding his cousin’s murder by the Luna Brotherhood.”<br />
“Well the next time he or anyone has questions for you,” Brett speaking; “they must first inform me.”<br />
“Did what sheriff Cooper say is true,” Julie speaking; “regarding what sentence I could face?”<br />
“I’m not going to lie,” Brett looking serious; “you escaping the building and murdering someone in the process did not help. You were tried in absentia and as such you denied yourself the right to speak on your behalf. Plus,” Brett sighing; “Tachibana read the letter you wrote to your parents. It made your intent pretty clear with your actions of late.” Brett looking at Julie as she tried to process what was just said to her; “the Luna Brotherhood found the letter after searching your home. From what I heard, it drove your father to drink really hard.”<br />
“Any my mother,” Julie asking; “how did my mother react?”<br />
“She was already in the hospital when the letter was found,” Brett answering; “being told of your escape, caused her to faint in Frances Twist’s office. Melissa and the baby and fine by the way.”<br />
“You read the letter as well,” Julie looking pensive; “I take it they are not here then?”<br />
“Your parent’s have not showed up to my knowledge,” Brett staring at her client; “I doubt they will. Your letter effectively made them disown you.”<br />
“Then that means I am no longer your client then,” Julie speaking; “It’s not as if I could pay you legal fees.”<br />
“Are you firing me,” Brett asking.<br />
“It’s not as if I’m going to walk out the front doors,” Julie answering; “like I was able to at the courthouse on Wednesday.”<br />
<br />
As Julie was talking to her soon to be former attorney; Sheriff Copper was walking into the common area of the council building. Seeing Tachibana talking to Lance Knight as the two headed to the buffet table, he quietly walks to the reading room. The only room he knows of that has a computer with internet access. Entering he sees a white were-panther and grey with russet fur were-panthress and a black furred hybrid, each with green eyes in the reading room using the computer he needs. Coughing as he approaches; “may I use that computer for a few moments? I need to look something up before I head out.”<br />
“Okay,” the grey were-panthress says; “we were nearly finished anyways. Is the council going to be calling us up soon?”<br />
“I can’t answer that,” the sheriff answering; “but I’m sure they will call you soon Frieda.” Looking at the white were-panther; “you as well Eric.”<br />
Eric looks that the large were-grizzy; wondering how he could know his name, before Spencer speaks.<br />
“You’re not going to say hi to me sheriff,” Spencer chuckling.<br />
“That’s the sheriff,” Eric looking dumbfounded; “how do you know Spencer?”<br />
“Because he likes to fish in his fursona,” Spencer grinning; “I’ve seen him a lot by the river near my house in the past few months.”<br />
“No better place to get fresh salmon,” Sheriff Cooper smiles; “during the salmon run that is. Now let me at that computer I need to look up an address or two.”<br />
<br />
The three watch as the sheriff in his were-grizzly fursona deftly use his paws to type on the keyboard, despite that he has large six inch claws from each brown furred digit. Using the usual directories and even social media; Douglas Cooper quickly finds what he is looking for; an address for Betty Van Rosenberg as well as a phone number and a picture of what she looks like when not furry. Closing up the windows and committing the information to memory; Douglas gets up and is about to leave. Turning around to stare at the three young weres; Douglas was about to interrupt them again, but decided not to. Instead he leaves the reading room and mutters to himself; “Betty Van Rosenberg, you and I are going to have a talk. Whether you want to have one or not.”</p>
