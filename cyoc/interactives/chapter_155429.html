<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William wakes up on the couch. He spent the entire night watching TV and eating all the snacks he could want, and he could get. He got up and looked at the clock on the wall. Luckily it was now Sunday, his parents wouldn’t be back for another week and a few days. He stood up, brushed all the crumbs off himself and realised how much of the house was a mess. He wanted to clean up, well actually that would be a lie, he couldn’t be bothered to clean up but he knew he should clean up.<br />
He looked at the mess for a while before saying, “ugh, I just wish I—“ his hands covered his mouth immediately. ‘Shit,’ he thought to himself, ‘I don’t think I’m still making a wish but whatever I say next could be taken as a wish, I’ve gotta think about whatever I say next. I’m gonna just make a wish. I don’t wanna clean up and I can’t just pull a servant out of my pocket, I’ll wish for one.’ He decided in his mind, he uncovered his mouth, “I have a servant, they can do anything I ask them, regardless of the effort or... or actually... they do anything I ask them regardless if it makes sense.” William stood there for a moment. Trying to work out if it had worked or not.<br />
“Everything alright, sir?” A voice said from behind, William screamed,<br />
“Oh my god!! Who the hell... oh...” William shouted, realising who he was. His servant. He was Male, he appeared to be a butler of sort. He guessed that it was based on how he would have imagined it. He looked a little like Alfred from Batman. A short combed haircut and a grey, thin moustache, “umm... hi... can you...” William stuttered,<br />
“Would you like me to clean up the mess, sir?”<br />
“Yes... yes can you do that?”<br />
“Of course, sir,” the butler got to it at once. <br />
<br />
William stood there, thinking again. He had just used up his wish for that day on a butler. An old man. He didn’t really like how he looked, so he decided ‘what the hell’, he might as well ask him a few questions.<br />
“Excuse me... what’s your name?” William said,<br />
“I do not have a name, nor do I need one. I know whenever you are speaking to me so address me however you please,” the butler smiled and got back to cleaning.<br />
“Well... okay...”<br />
“Very good, sir,”<br />
“Do you have to look like this?” William blurted out, he wanted to ask the butler if he had to be an old man. It made him slightly uncomfortable,<br />
“Why no of course not, sir. You can command me to do any task you please, if you want to change any aspects of myself, just request it and I’ll get right on it.”<br />
“So... if I asked you to become...” William, like usual, thought for a moment, “what if I ask you to look like... a woman?” William questioned, his face started to go red, complimenting his ginger hair,<br />
“Yes, sir,” The butler stood up, he didn’t seem phased as his body began to shift. William watched in awe as the minor bulge in the butlers pants disappeared and he grew two breasts. His hair didn’t grow any longer and his age didn’t change, the only other thing that changed was his moustache disappeared. His clothing didn’t change either. A short haired, slim, old woman stood in front of William. The suit was restricting, her breasts were clearly there but were not accentuated.<br />
“Can you become younger?” William asked,<br />
“Yes of course, sir,” a more female voice said. The butlers face became younger, wrinkles faded away. When she got to around 25 William assumed that she would stop regressing, but she didn’t. Her body began shrinking, she became that of a 16 year old by the time she was finished. Fairly developed but clearly not mature yet. She looked down at her very loose clothes, “one moment, sir,” she pulled a string on the side of the suit, it shrunk to fit her. It did still look like it was for a boy however, “anything else you’d like me to change?” A much younger and feminine voice said,<br />
“Ummm... maybe 2 more things,” William said, this time he was really red at the 16 year old girl speaking to him, “can you... you know... get...” he stuttered way more now,<br />
“I understand, sir,” she said. She stood straight, her body grew again, to that of a 19 year old. The suit was very tight now, skin tight. Her breasts began to expand larger. From the fairly small size they were to much larger. From a B cup to a DD cup. The suit burst open, revealing the bare breasts, “whoops. My mistake sir,” she pulled on the suit, it expanded, she then covered up her breasts with her arm. She moved her arm and it was like it was never broken.<br />
<br />
“That is all then, sir,” she got to her knees and continued cleaning. William stood, watching in awe as a 19 year old did everything he asked. He penis was almost fully hard, he was so turned on by the power he had. He spent the whole day telling the woman what to do, watching her do it. At one point he asked her to change her clothing to something more feminine.<br />
<br />
William finished the day with a 19 year old woman with DD breasts, wearing a very tight suit, made for women to show off their curves. He even requested her to have her cleavage showing, to which she obliged.<br />
<br />
William was beyond satisfied with his wish that day. He was thinking about everything he could do the next day with his wish.</p>
