<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A large Toyota eight seater rolled up to the property, four people inside of the enormous vehicle, which otherwise carried some of their belongings.<br />
<br />
When the car pulled up and stopped at the house, one by one the family would get out of the car. &quot;Honey, let&#39;s make sure everything in the farmhouse is okay. I paid a lot of money to get us this home away from home.&quot; Malcolm Holland, the father of the family, stepped out. Silver and blond haired with slate gray eyes, the 55 year old family patriarch was despite his age in incredibly good shape. He had been a bodybuilder in his youth, and even at this age, Malcolm remained handsome if somewhat weathered, fit, cleanshaven, and heavily muscled. He dressed in a tank top, jeans, and boots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I hope so, this place has some astonishing views. I love the look here!&quot; Natasha Holland, Malcolm&#39;s wife, was ten years his junior and very frequently attempted to pretty herself up for her husband. She was even still more than beautiful enough for a woman in her thirties. Her features were curvy and appealing, though not exactly fat either. She had long dark brown hair, blue eyes, and frequently wore lip gloss. She wore a simple shirt and shorts, preferring to be able to move and walk when she needed to.<br />
<br />
&quot;So HOW far away is the nearest town? I mean, I&#39;d like to be able to make SOME friends.&quot; Derek Holland, age 21, the handsome eldest son, very obviously took after his father in terms of build. Muscled, dirty blond haired and with light blue eyes, Derek was stockier built than his father had been at his age, but compensated by being every bit as muscular and then some. No abs on this one, but his build looked impressive enough either way. Derek wore a letterman jacket, a short sleeved blue shirt, jeans and sneakers.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I just wanna head off to a swimming pool.&quot; Ian Holland, the youngest son, was 16 and openly bisexual. His hair was permed by his own request, light blond, and his eyes were gray like his father&#39;s. Ian was more tightly toned than Derek, and preferred swimming to football and weightlifting. He dressed in a tight tank top, shorts, and sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a town not too far away from here. I looked it up and saw there WAS a swimming pool...&quot; Malcolm said as he got out and started hoisting the belongings into the house in their containers, two by two. He grinned at his wife, who just sighed and shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey, be careful with your back! You&#39;re not as young as you used to be!&quot; Nat shouted after her husband.<br />
<br />
Ian rolled his eyes, and murmured to himself, &quot;Here&#39;s hoping there&#39;s some hot country guys and gals out here...&quot; He shook his head and got up, both him and Derek starting to help take in some of the family&#39;s belongings. As they went inside, the family noted the two story farmhouse was honestly pretty eerie for how well put together everything was. Despite some odd stories, everything was picturesque, nothing was out of order, there were no hints of anything awry here.<br />
<br />
No cobwebs. No spiders. No roaches. No dust. Everything was more or less like someone packed up and left just weeks ago. Not how it was actually, where someone apparently left six months ago, and nobody else stepped forward to claim the house. Mal looked around and said, &quot;Okay, kids, you get your choice of rooms first. Jose&#39;s coming by later to deliver the rest of the belongings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calling the big room!&quot; Derek used his muscular strength to hoist his belongings and carry them all up to the big room upstairs.<br />
<br />
Ian protested - but did not begrudge his brother the fact that he was merely taking advantage of the circumstances. Ian groused a little under his breath, mumbling about his brother being an &quot;overmuscled oaf&quot;, but otherwise just went ahead, chose the second biggest room on the second floor, and started setting up.<br />
<br />
In his room, Derek looked around, noting that this was really weirdly well put together. He&#39;d think AT LEAST that these rooms would be in something of poor condition. But no. It looked like the rooms were all in great condition, and the bed was even made in advance of his arrival. Kind of gave off the feeling of this all being some sort of an elaborate set up, but Derek doubted anyone could plot that far in advance. He started unpacking, putting his fitness weights, books on nutrition, and laptop up on the bed.<br />
<br />
He looked out the window, and thought he saw a horse out there for a moment. Derek scratched his head for a moment, shrugged, and figured it might just be some wild horses or something. But its coloration was pretty striking. The horse was solid black, and he swore it looked like it was looking in at him...<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Malcolm and Natasha got their room set up - the large den room on the first floor, just past the backdoor entrance to the house. The room was moody, lit well and in a certain odd fashion that might be romantic, and exactly right for Malcolm&#39;s business dealings. As Malcolm set up his computer, Natasha started rubbing his shoulders, and Malcolm grinned a little bit. <br />
<br />
He checked the door to see if the kids were downstairs. He didn&#39;t want any awkward experiences happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hon, you know the kids are gonna be running around,&quot; Malcolm started, &quot;Let&#39;s get settled in before we break in the bed down here with a round of our fun times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say, honey.&quot; Natasha murmured in his ear and kept setting up, all the while teasingly starting to take off her shirt, all the while beginning to try to remove Malcolm&#39;s tank top. She was really feeling the moody lighting down here, and something about it really brought out her inner cougar.<br />
<br />
Listening in for any activity going on, Malcolm finally just shrugged and walked to the door, shutting it behind him and taking off his tank top, throwing it in a corner of the room. This was followed by his pants, leaving him standing there in his underwear, grinning at his wife. He put his arms up and flexed, delighted by his fitness even heading into his mid-fifties. &quot;Hope you&#39;re ready for a long, hard night, Mrs. Holland.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I am, stud.&quot; And with that, they kissed and moved on to the bed for their nightly enjoyments.</p>
