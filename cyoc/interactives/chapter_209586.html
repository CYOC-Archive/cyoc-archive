<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Krentol for this AMAZING chapter! Remember to go check out CYOC Discord at https://discord.gg/N3teFFhP. Read the rules. It&#39;s a one day quarantine before you can post!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You’ve served me well, Rakko,” Master had said, “so I am giving you the opportunity to serve me further and gain a bit of a reward in the process.”<br />
<br />
“Serving Master is reward enough for Rakko!” the small, red scaled kobold shouted with trained enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
“Indeed it is,” Master chuckled, “but your task is to eliminate five trouble makers for me. And what better way than to mold them into something more useful?”<br />
<br />
Master gestured to a nearby stand, on which sat six collars.<br />
<br />
Three of them were made out of a polished silvery metal that had been woven into hundreds of delicate strands that were intertwined with dragon scales like a fine cloth. Studding the collars were a number of angular gems, each of which looked like a fiery red eye with a blue, vertical pupil that was pulsating as though trying to escape.<br />
<br />
Sitting next to those were two collars, both of which were made out of a fine reptilian leather – brilliant scales running the length of them. Deep black pearls studded these collars. Taking a closer look, Rakko noticed a pink mist hungrily swirling within the pearls. He could almost feel the mist reaching out for him, as though an overwhelming force was trapped in the gems, lusting for his body but unable to reach out.<br />
<br />
Finally, sitting by itself, was a much plainer collar made out of a course, black and white blotched leather. Running the length of the collar was a thin band of dull, brown scales. Rakko was intrigued and, as he went to reach for the collar, he saw the scales begin to let off a faint glow like fog in moonlight.<br />
<br />
“I would be especially careful with that one,” Master said.<br />
<br />
“These are riding dragon collars, well the first five anyways,” he continued, “Three will create males – one for you and your two subordinates. The males are rather intelligent, the females not so much, but they should keep the males entertained and you can breed them if you wish.”<br />
<br />
“As for the last collar, it’s a bit more… special. You only have five targets, but if one of them slights you in some way it should prove a fitting punishment.”<br />
<br />
Rakko’s eyes shone with excitement as he exclaimed, “Master! For Rakko to be granted a dragon of his very own! Dragon are master to kobold, for kobold to be master of dragon… Is dream come true for Rakko!”<br />
<br />
“As I said Rakko, you have served me well. Continue to serve me and this is but the first of your rewards,” Master replied. “Now, the collars have a few more effects that you should be aware of…”<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Rakko was huddled in the kitchen of a massive mansion with his two subordinates, a green kobold named Vogu and an orange kobold named Teppo. They’d snuck into a massive house party that was being hosted here two nights ago. As the party had winded down, Rakko questioned the mansion’s help, finding that they had all been hired within the past twenty four hours.<br />
<br />
With a plan in mind, Rakko had raided the servant’s quarters, finding some kobold sized butler uniforms. From there, he and his subordinates had simply taken the role of the mansion’s newly hired butlers, something the other staff seemed to accept without question.<br />
<br />
Now, looking out from the kitchen, Rakko saw a human female, an elf, an orc, and an anthropomorphic three headed dog eating the breakfast Teppo had brought them just moments ago.<br />
<br />
“You sure this work? Orc could squish Vogu like pancake,” the green scaled kobold whispered.<br />
<br />
“Master gave us these collars, they work,” Rakko hissed.<br />
<br />
“But Master is gone! And minotaur and bugbear still sleep, what do about them?”<br />
<br />
“You want dragon? Master gone but collars still work.” Rakko said as he rubbed a claw across flexible metal. “Give males and one female to me, you two take other collars, deal with other two while sleep.”<br />
<br />
Rakko picked up a serving tray with four of the collars on it. Vogu might be a coward, but the concerned that he had voiced echoed through Rakko’s mind. His diminutive body was shorter than the table that these massive creatures were currently eating at. If this failed, if they didn’t believe him or the collars didn’t work, then any one of them could crush his bones into a fine powder. But Rakko wanted a dragon. Not a single kobold would admit it for fear of being burned to cinders, but every kobold secretly yearned to be the master instead of the servant.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Rakko did his best to purge the fear from his mind as he took the first step out into the dining room.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Rakko bring gift from Master Trog!”<br />
<br />
The eyes at the table first turned to the small kobold, then to platter of decorative collars he was holding.<br />
<br />
“Master Trog say have friends try on when they wake up. Say big party tonight and want everyone look fancy! If collar doesn’t fit, Rakko take to tailor to adjust, have ready for tonight!”<br />
<br />
Rakko walked around the table, handing a metal collar to Mark, Rok, and Rusty, as well as a leather collar to Sophia.<br />
<br />
Rusty took his collar with a bit of hesitation. As he took in the air through three different noses, he couldn’t help but smell something a bit off. Plus, he had the vaguest recollection of seeing Trog – no, Troy at the time – with this kobold before being turned into a cerberus himself.<br />
<br />
“You’re the butler here Rakko?” Rusty’s center head asked, a slight confusion evident in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Rakko hired by Master Trog when he buy house a few days ago. Is good, loyal kobold to kind Master,” Rakko chirped.<br />
<br />
“And you were in the park with him yesterday?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, went with Master Trog and his friends to park, was tour guide, showed Master attractions after master dog and master orc left us!”<br />
<br />
“And Trog bought these collars at the park?”<br />
<br />
“No!” Rakko exclaimed, sensing the inquisitorial intent behind the question, “Collars delivered when Master Trog moved into house, had special made for Master’s friends.”<br />
<br />
Rusty wondered just how much reality had changed over the past few days. When they had stepped onto the plane, the group were the wealthy owners of a high end, robotic sex toy company. Now, Troy was Trog, an apparently multimillionaire fantasy porn magnate who recently bought a playboy mansion in the LA hills.<br />
<br />
Rusty held the warm metal collar in his hand while he looked at the small red kobold, standing in a slightly hunched, submissive stance in front of him. Rakko seemed trustworthy and everything about his story seemed plausible – especially given that, with Sebastian gone, there shouldn’t be anyone else trying to trick them into using a cursed item. Still, Rusty couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off.<br />
<br />
The other three sitting around the table didn’t share Rusty’s apprehension, and eagerly tried on their new gifts. Rusty, on the other hand, just sat and watched, waiting to see if anything happened.<br />
<br />
“Feels good!” Rok said as he closed the latch on his collar with a click.<br />
<br />
“Ya, it feels like I’m not wearing anything at all,” Mark agreed. “Aren’t you going to try yours on Rusty?”<br />
<br />
Rusty just sat there, collar in hand. Rusty had half expected the other three to shrink down into kobold brood mothers for Rakko’s harem, but all three were wearing their collars with seemingly no effect. Still, Rusty felt an odd sensation coming from the collar in his hand. It was an ominous, hungering feeling, like something was reaching out towards him. At the same time, Rusty felt an aura coming off the other collars, like they were watching him, waiting for him to do something.<br />
<br />
“Trying to figure out which head to put yours on?” Mark joked.<br />
<br />
Rusty opened the mouth on his central head, but before he could say anything the collars around the other’s necks let out a bright flash that blinded all 6 of Rusty’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” he thought, “these are cursed!”<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Rusty, the shock of being suddenly blinded caused him to drop his collars to the floor. Dazzled with a haze of white obscuring his vision, Rusty could only sit helplessly at the table as he heard small claws scraping against the floor. He instinctively raised a paw to protect his left and right necks, but he realized how pointless that was as he felt cold metal slip around the center one.<br />
<br />
*Click*<br />
<br />
A strange warmth radiated out of the metal pressing into the fur on Rusty’s neck as every muscle on his body grew tight. His vision returned, letting him catch a brief glance of the metal collar on his central neck before four of his eyes closed up as his side heads began melting back into his shoulders.<br />
<br />
He tried reaching up to grab at the collar, only to find that his thumbs had recessed into the back of his hands, all while sinewy flesh grew into the gaps between his fingers and thick, rubbery scales began to form in bands on the bottom of his new paws.<br />
<br />
Rusty still had his paws pressed up against his neck when his claws grew sharper and longer, poking into his flesh as they grew into black talons. “Ouch,” he growled, pulling his lengthening arms away from himself.<br />
<br />
A sudden popping sensation in his hips caused his chest and head to suddenly feel much heavier and he dropped forward, landing on all fours as his claws dug into a thin layer of small wooden shavings that was materializing out of the floor. Before Rusty could think about the implications of that, another pop signaled his elbows rotating ninety degrees, finishing his arms transformation into forelegs.<br />
<br />
Rusty didn’t realize that he was nervously wagging his tail but, as he adjusted to his new enforced quadrupedal stance, he noticed a rapidly growing weight tugging his hips back and forth. Looking behind him, he watched as brown fur fell out as brilliant green and red scales grew out, forming an alternating pattern of color designed to dazzle its viewer.<br />
<br />
While the disappearing fluff initially caused his tail to look thinner, the source of the new weight pulling on his hips quickly became apparent as the vertebrae in his tail expanded outwards while inelastic sinew grew in to anchor them in place. It wasn’t long before Rusty’s tail lost most of its dexterity, being able to flex only past the halfway point.<br />
<br />
As his tail thickened, it pushed his asshole down in between his legs, where both it and his balls were sucked inside a small slit that formed in his scales. His cock, meanwhile, began to fade from bright red to a pale white, all while his knot shrank away as his cock became smooth and tapered.<br />
<br />
While his lower body was busy rearranging itself, Rusty saw his muzzle begin to grow longer and broader in front of his eyes. As it expanded, the thin fur covering it melted away as his skin hardened with the same red and green patterned scales covering the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
His ears moved down to the side of his head and shrunk into tiny holes. Pain erupted in his ears’ former spots as two large horns burrowed out of his skull to take their place.<br />
<br />
Rusty cried out as he instinctively raised a thick, clumsy pay to bat at the source of his pain. Running his paw along the top of the head, Raxtllyz felt his pads run over the thick, hard bone that made up his new horns.<br />
<br />
Confusion began washing over Raxtllyz as he felt his thoughts swirling out of his head and dancing about the world around him. Chairs turned to piles of straw and the walls thinned into wooden planks as the room around him turned into a barn. Then back to a house. Then a barn. Rusty felt himself being pushed back and forth, as though reality itself was gyrating between two completely different worlds.<br />
<br />
Raxtllyz closed his eyes as dizziness mixed with nausea while his body rocked back and forth on a turbulent sea of reality. Then there was silence and stillness.<br />
<br />
With the world now steady and his eyes still closed, Raxtllyz let his tongue take an exploratory taste of the air around him. He tasted hay, old wood, and a young female dragon in heat.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
*Click*<br />
<br />
The smell of simmering bacon was all it had taken to rouse Trogg from a deep slumber. Eyes closed; he had let his nose guide him as he stumbled his way out of bed towards a tasty breakfast.<br />
<br />
The bugbear ran a thick tongue over protruding tusks as he imagined a massive plate filled with meat, eggs, and toast. He imagined himself drenching the spread in syrup and butter before funneling it into his gut.<br />
<br />
Eyes still closed, he gave his belly a slap. As the fat rippled, the only thing in Trogg’s mind was the thought of adding those wonderful breakfast smells to his own bulk.<br />
<br />
Trogg was so focused on the feast that his nose said was before him that he didn’t notice the pinches moving up his back, or the thin leather band snaking its way around his neck. Not even the sound of a clasp clicking into place was enough to stop him from walking, eyes closed, towards a tasty darkness.<br />
<br />
It was only when that smell began to shift from melting fat to something more earthy and… musky, that Trogg’s thoughts began to shift. His tongue still running over his teeth, the picture of steaming bacon that had occupied his mind slowly transformed into an imagine of a dark green, animalistic looking cock. As he ran the length of it in his mind, he started at the tapered end and slowly worked the picture back until his mind was focused on a scaly, reptilian slit.<br />
<br />
The taste of salty precum filled his mouth as he imagined sticking his muzzle up against that slit, running his tongue over the cock’s smooth, warm length. Lapping at it until it was covered in a thin layer of lubricating saliva, then turning her body around and…<br />
<br />
Trogyzx thoughts were interrupted as he heard a strange animalist whine, followed by something hiss “Sssshe not for sserd rate sragon like you. Ssshe all mine.”<br />
<br />
The musky scent, the eerie howl, the strange voice – nothing made sense to Trogyzx mind, and it made even less sense when he opened his eyes. Where he had expected to see his friends sitting around a breakfast table, he was instead greeted by the sight of the inside of a barn.<br />
<br />
Across the room from him, where the table should have been, was a golden scaled… dragon? It had a thick dragon like body, but it had wings in place of forearms. A wyvern, Trogyzx realized.<br />
<br />
While the light rippled off its scales, forming a brilliant hue that spoke of treasure and wealth, its eyes were a rather dull brown. Peering into them, Trozyzx could see a mixture of stupidity and fear – almost like the look that he would expect to see on a cow that was being chased by a wolf.<br />
<br />
Clearly in a panic, the wyvern was trying to use its forewings to grasp a leather collar that was wrapped around its neck.<br />
<br />
It was strange to watch, Tzozyzx thought… as the wyvern continued to rub the blunt edges of its forewings along its neck, it almost looked like it expected there to be hands at the midpoint of the wing, with the look in its eyes conveying the limitations of its intellect in understanding why it couldn’t remove the collar.<br />
<br />
Then there were the sounds it was making – a loud, frightened whine, the strange part about it was that it sounded like there was an attempt at rhythm and tone to the cries. It was like listening to someone try to mimic a language they’d never heard before. The wyvern could make the same basic sounds as a human, but couldn’t form, or possibly understand, the words that it wanted to use.<br />
<br />
Cowering in the corner was a modestly sized black creature that could have passed for a dragon were it not for its lack of wings and the thick, green slime oozing out of its mouth. A quick glance to the blackened straw beneath it made it apparent what that slime was – acid.<br />
<br />
Perhaps more impressive was a larger, white scaled, albeit also wingless dragon glaring down at the black. As the white dragon opened its mouth, Zozyzx could see thin blue streaks of lightning arcing between sharp, white fangs.<br />
<br />
“Jusst cause you asssid belsher doessn’t mean you need ssto drool asssid everywhere. Go back to your sssstal before you ruin ssthe floor!” It hissed as it glanced at the wyverns backside, a look of lust and greed evident in the white dragon’s eyes.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Zozyzx watched the trio of dragons in the corner with befuddlement.<br />
<br />
Where was he? Where were his friends? He’d gone to sleep in a mansion overlooking Studio Village, but now he was in a barn filled with dragons?<br />
<br />
Was this a book? Did Arcane find him and teleport him somewhere else? Zozyzx was so confused.<br />
<br />
But he didn’t have time to think about his situation before movement in the corner of his eyes drew his vision to the other side of the room. Standing there was a large, red and green scaled dragon – wingless like the others – that was lapping at the air with a sinewy red tongue. Was it… tasting the air?<br />
<br />
Its eyes closed, the dragon slowly drew its tongue back into its snout before flaring its nostrils as it greedily inhaled. Its lips formed into something resembling a smile as its snout centered on Zozyzx.<br />
<br />
Zozyzx didn’t think he had blinked, but in a flash the dragon’s eyes had gone from closed shut to wide open. Two fiery orbs gazed out at Zozyzx as thin, reptilian pupils locked in on him. Zozyzx could see the dragon’s tongue flick back out as though it was tasting… something. And it didn’t take long for Zozyzx to realize that something was him as the dragon began moving in his direction.<br />
<br />
Zozyzx’s first instinct was to run, but as he went to move his legs he felt a strange crack resonate through his body as his hips shifted into an unfamiliar new configuration. As gap between his legs widened, Zozyzx felt his feet begin to slip out from under him as he fell backwards towards the ground.<br />
<br />
The feeling of floor running up along the bottom his thick tail was bizarre as he hadn’t been aware that he even had a tail until just now. But even weirder was what he didn’t feel. Zozyzx realized that he was falling backwards onto his butt, and he winced in anticipation of his balls slamming into the floor.<br />
<br />
But that particular pain never came. Instead, Zozyzx’s crotch his the floor with an wet thump. Wait a second, Zozyzx thought, wet?<br />
<br />
Fear shot through Zozyzx’s mind as he began involuntarily pawing at his crotch. At first, he had been hoping for his paws to run into something thick and meaty down there, but what they found instead was a puffy slit. He could feel warmth radiating out of it and into his paws, all while small beads of sticky moisture dribbled out.<br />
<br />
Zozyzx mind began to fill with panic as he continued trying to paw at his new slit. He was trying to grab onto something, to reach inside of himself and pull something out – something that he knew had to be in there.<br />
<br />
What he didn’t seem to realize was that his fingers had grown small claws, then retreated into his knuckles before locking in place – completely incapable of gripping onto anything. Not that it mattered, even if he still had hands, the thing he was looking for no longer existed. And little did Zozyxz realize that all he was doing by rubbing himself was to cause more moisture to leak out into the surrounding air and shocking jolts of pleasure to shoot up from the slit and zing into his...or rather, her...mind.<br />
<br />
And even more unfortunate for Zozyzx, that moisture that contained a rich, floral scent – the very same scent that Raxtllyz had tasted earlier… and was now tasting again.<br />
<br />
Zozyzx looked up and saw the massive red and green dragon standing over her. She saw him taste the air, and she saw something slither out from between his legs. It looked like an eyeless, dark green snake that writhed back and forth as though it was searching for something.<br />
<br />
Zozyzx was transfixed. It was identical to the cock she had been imagining earlier. She knew that it was searching for her. Searching for her slit. She could imagine it entering her, feel herself wrapping around it, feel it…<br />
<br />
A slight pulse ran down Raxtllyz’s cock and a small amount of clear precum splatter on Zozyzx’s snout. The sudden feeling of that warm, thick goo dribbling down the side of her mouth snapped her out of her new fantasy and brought her mind back to the present. Zozyzx didn’t need to be told what was about to happen – her body knew. And as much as her body may have wanted it, her mind was still intact and she knew that she was about to raped, violently, by the much larger dragon. She knew that whatever her place might be in this strange new reality, she would never escape if she let that happen to her.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Zozyzx, the body that her mind was now sending commands to wasn’t the same one she had just minutes ago. The best she could do was to awkwardly stumble to all fours and turn around. Peering back into what had once been her room she caught a reflection of herself in the mirror and realized just how different her body was.<br />
<br />
Instead of an old, chubby bugbear, she saw a turquoise blue, wingless dragon staring back at her. While her overall body shape was similar to the other dragons in the room, her proportions were lither while her legs seemed longer and more gangly. As she looked in the mirror, she could see two spines growing out of the back of her forelegs, she instinctively fanned them out as more spines grew in while webbing grew in between them.<br />
<br />
Her new wingless – if she could call them that – looked somewhat like a cross between a wing and a fin sticking off the back of her arm. They weren’t large enough to fly with and appeared to be more decorative than anything else. And given that she still had her forearms and paws, she clearly wasn’t a wyvern, so what was she?<br />
<br />
She didn’t have long to wonder before she saw Raxtllyz’s head appear behind hers in the mirror. She could feel him press down on top of her as his body moved on top of hers and his forepaws grasped onto her chest, locking her in place.<br />
<br />
She felt his cock snake between her legs as its probed for an entrance. She looked up at the bottom of his jaw and let out a slight whimper as she felt him part her entrance. It felt so good, she was so needy and moist, and her slit longed for more of him inside her.<br />
<br />
He was slow, at first, as he pressed inside of her. She felt more and more of his length slipping inside when a sudden jolt of his body caused him to rock forward and take her all the way to the hilt. Her mind exploded in shame and pleasure as her innards clenched around him, hugging his great shaft, massaging it.<br />
<br />
It was happening, Zozyxz thought. She wanted for it to stop, she wanted to run away, to gain some time to figure out what was happening and come up with a way to fix it. At the same time, she didn&#39;t want it to stop, not until it quenched the burning thirst in her loins. But as the wyvern tightened his grip on her, she felt her heart sink as she realized that she was powerless to stop the massive dragon straddling her new body.<br />
<br />
The warring feelings of pleasure and shame and horror caused nausea rose up in the back of her throat as she opened her mouth and a torrent of fluid gushed forth. The first thing that she noticed about it was that it didn’t taste bad. In fact, it didn’t taste like anything at all. The second thing she noticed was that it wasn’t stopping.<br />
<br />
She heard the fluid splashing on the ground, and when she looked back in the mirror, what she saw looking back was a dragon with a very shocked look on its face as water poured out of its open mouth.<br />
<br />
Was she a water dragon? If she was, why couldn’t she stop the water?<br />
<br />
Another thrust by Raxtllyz resonated through her body, causing her slit to twist itself around his member while her jaws slammed shut. It felt so good! <br />
<br />
But with her jaw now closed, the water coming out of her throat began to fill the inside of her mouth. Another thrust from Raxtllyz and she felt the water, which had filled her mouth, began pooling in pouches in her cheeks. As her cheek pouches uncomfortably pressed out with water, she tried to open her mouth to relieve the pressure, to moan with pleasure, only to find that she couldn’t.<br />
<br />
Running her tongue along the inside of her mouth, she found that her teeth had disappeared. Instead, she felt a solid, bony plate running the length of her snout – her jaw, she realized, had fused together.<br />
<br />
As her body generated an endless stream of water, she felt Raxtllyz pull back slightly, before ramming himself deep inside of her. She felt his cock pressing against a fleshy wall that she didn’t even know she had, all while the water filled her cheeks and began inflating a new pouch in her throat. It was all so good, so confusing, she didn&#39;t know what to do, how to get rid of the water.<br />
<br />
Her cheeks and throat filled to brim, she felt a tremendous amount of pressure as her body continued to try to force more water out through her fused jaws.<br />
<br />
Another thrust from Raxtllyz brought two dramatically different sensations. The back half of her body was pressed up against his stomach, her tail wrapped around his while her new vaginal walls constricted around him, twisting and pulling against a wonderfully dense, long mass that was pressed inside of her.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, she could feel the water inside of her mouth sloshing inside of her, unpleasantly stretching her cheek and throat pouches while small bursts of steam shot out of her nostrils every time she exhaled. <br />
<br />
It was too sudden, too much. She didn’t even know why she was a dragon, why she was a she, why she was… here?<br />
<br />
Where was here? She realized she didn’t know. She could see what was in front of her, but when she tried to think about what the rest of the room looked like all she could picture was blackness. She looked to side – there were three dragons over there. What were their names? And what had she been looking at before? Again, blackness. She couldn’t remember what she had been looking at. She was even having trouble remembering her own name.<br />
<br />
She saw a red kobold walk up to her, his glee evident in the smile radiating from his face. Wincing each time the dragon on top of her pounded against her insides, Zyxz nonetheless did her best to put on a pleading look. She didn’t know who this kobold was, but she had no choice but to hope that it could help.<br />
<br />
As if sensing her distress, it reached out and put a small claw on her snout.<br />
<br />
“You a Skalder, hope you like new water sacks, you gonna be stuck with them for a while.”<br />
<br />
It was perhaps the look of shock that overcame her face that prompted the small lizard to laugh before continuing, “don’t need to worry, they keep brain but not mind. Is terrible to lose mind, yes? You not keep brain, but get to keep mind. Not forget who you was.”<br />
<br />
It let out another laugh before a cruel look came over its face. Staring straight into Zyxz’s eyes, the kobold continued, “Not that you ever be them again.”<br />
<br />
The lizard laughed and kept talking, but Zyxz couldn’t make any sense of the words coming out of its mouth. She tried looking around the room – at this point she didn’t even know what for. She was just hoping that she would see something, anything that would help.<br />
<br />
As she looked around the barn, her gaze was caught by a nearby bedroom. Inside, sitting on top of a bed, was a half cow, half dragon creature wearing a dull white and black leather collar. Zyxz didn’t understand the significance of the collar, all she knew was that she didn’t want this other creature to befall the same fate that she did.<br />
<br />
So as she stood there on all fours, the dragon on top of her kept pounding blissfully away, humiliating her own body to pleasure his own, Zyxz stared at the new cow creature and with nothing to communicate but her eyes, did the best that she could to tell it to get away.<br />
<br />

<br />
Xarxos didn’t want to open his eyes. All the minotaur wanted to do was to keep laying in these soft sheets, to ignore the smell of bacon of eggs wafting through his nose, to just sleep for the rest of the day. But something or, he thought, someone had woken him up.<br />
<br />
There was a tight feeling around his neck that hadn’t been there the night before… his sleepy mind drifted through what it could be. Maybe it was one of those stupid prank collars Trogg had talked about buying in the park?<br />
<br />
Stiff fingers ran along his neck until they reached a loop of blunt leather. Yep, Xarxos realized, Trogg was probably playing a prank on him.<br />
<br />
Groggy eyes opened to a strange sight – staring at him from door to his room was a small bipedal lizard like creature. A kobold? Xarxos was too tired and his mind was too muddy to fully process who or what was standing in his doorway, so he just looked at it dumbly, not knowing what to say.<br />
<br />
The kobold, for its part, just looked back at him. It didn’t look malicious. In fact, it looked downright apologetic.<br />
<br />
“Was only supposed to be 5 of you,” it said, “didn’t want to use that one but had no choice.” Then, after a brief pause, “That one look like for cow though, maybe it not as bad for you as old master say.”<br />
<br />
Had no choice? What was it talking it? Xarxos was too tired to make sense of what was going on. He smacked his lips and lowered one of his hands to his stomach, before running it down to his crotch. Fully expecting to scratch at the top of his morning wood, his hand just kept going past his pubic area and down into a… slit.<br />
<br />
Panic shot through his mind. His body tensed and his eyes focused – just in time to see the two, large, wingless dragons fucking behind the kobold standing in his doorway. On top was a large, red and green dragon, its body rocking back and forth while its eyes were shut with a pleasured determination.<br />
<br />
Below it was a much smaller and skinnier one, adorned with brilliant blue scales and strange pouches on its cheek and neck that sloshed back and forth with each of the larger dragon’s thrusts. The smaller dragon was staring directly at Xarxos, its eyes filled horror, though not necessarily intelligence.<br />
<br />
The smaller dragon moved its lips, as though it was trying to open its mouth but wasn’t able to. Still, despite the lack of words, the message in its eyes was clear – RUN.<br />
<br />
Xarxos didn’t wait to act on that message, but his attempt to sit up and leap out of bed was thwarted as he felt thickened limbs pressing strangely against the mattress. Looking down, he had expected to see a thin, bovine tail lashing about between his legs. Instead, there was a thick tube of reptilian flesh covered in dull brown scales – like the tail of lizard – extending back into hips that were much wider than he remembered.<br />
<br />
He gave his toes an experimental wiggle only to realize how wrong that should be given that he went to bed last night with hooves. But just like with his tail, a glance up revealed two brown scaled feet that looked more at place on a lizard than a person, each ending in three stubby albeit wiggling toes that were topped with dull black claws.<br />
<br />
Looking down between his reforming hips, Xarxos saw the slit his hand had briefly slipped into earlier. He wasn’t sure what he had expected to see there – something ornate maybe? But instead, his new vent was nothing of the sort. All he saw was a small black vertical line running between two sets of the same brown scales that were covering the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
Staring at his vent, a thought shot through his head – was his cock still in there? Was that how lizards worked? It was such a strange thought, he realized, since he didn’t even know what he was turning into. Just the fact that he would waste time at all on it was an odd reminder of just how important that was to him. But unfortunately for Xarxos, it was what was growing in above his vent that confirmed what he was about to, or, perhaps, had already lost.<br />
<br />
Two mounds of brown, scaleless flesh were growing out above his… no, her new vent – each topped with a thick, protruding teat. Udders, like what Xarxos would expect to find on a horse. He… she was growing… two udders.<br />
<br />
Xarxos didn’t know what to do. As the necklace’s magic worked its way up her body, could she really run? How could she get away from something that was currently wrapped around her neck? She didn’t know what to do, so instinct took over and she rolled to her side and fell out of the bed, landing on her hands and new feet.<br />
<br />
The feeling of carpet giving way to wood chips under familiar, bovine hands was both relieving, as it told her that her upper body had yet to experience any meaningful changes, while simultaneously being a terrifying reminder of the new reality that was slowly phasing in around her.<br />
<br />
Unable to leave a quadrupedal stance due to her new hips, Xarxos briefly stood on all fours and tried to suppress the instinct to run long enough to come up with a plan. But the next change to hit her body rendered that both pointless and unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Pressure exploded into her stomach as she felt dozens of small, hard objects rapidly growing inside of her belly as it ballooned outwards in an attempt to hold them all inside. Looking down, Xarxos could see curved lumps pressing out against her belly scales from the inside. Eggs, she realized. She was filling with eggs.<br />
<br />
She could feel them growing inside of her, feel her muscles trying to contour around them, feel her stomach pressing up against the ground, lifting her up. Lifting her up?<br />
<br />
Oh god, she realized, there were so many. Her stomach was so full. It was bulging out by at least a foot on either side and pressing down into the ground below her – almost like an odd, lumpy pillow that her body was resting on. But it wasn’t a pillow and she wasn’t resting on it. It was her own body. Her own egg filled body. And it kept growing and growing, pushing her farther and farther off the ground.<br />
<br />
Her tail instinctively rose and her vent began straining and winking as new muscles began to run on autopilot, trying to squeeze, grip, and force out the dozens of eggs now filling her body. She didn’t want to do it, but it didn’t matter. Her mind was slowly losing control of her lower body as new instincts and reflexes took over.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t turning into the same kind of dragon as the ones outside. No, she thought as the terrifying realization washed over her, she was turning into some sort of egg laying dragon cow.<br />
<br />
The book of body!<br />
<br />
The odd method of transformation had left Xarxos’ hands and face still relatively untouched, and she had the good fortune to roll out of bed right now to the bedstand. On top of that bedstand was the book of body and below it was a small tuft of beige fur that had been left behind by one of the many party guests from the past few days. Together, those two things formed Xarxos’ last hope – her last salvation.<br />
<br />
She reached her front claws out, gripping the book in one and the fur in the other. Then, with a thickening tongue and growing mouth, she said the last word this body would ever say, “Swap.”<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Xarxos woke to sight of a dimly lit concrete wall. With a brain still at a full panic, Xarxos looked around – it was a small, windowless room, almost like a utility closet. Hanging from the ceiling was a bare, dim lightbulb. Sitting in a corner was a small pile of course looking blankets that Xarxos assumed could pass as a bed, while a small mirror was leaned up against the opposite wall. Other than those three things, the room was completely barren – almost like a cell.<br />
<br />
Still, Xarxos thought, being trapped in a cell wasn’t half as bad as the fate the kobolds had planned for that other body. That being said, this new body felt so odd – so small. It couldn’t move its mouth or hands, and there was an intense pressure in its ass. Well, no time like the present to find out.<br />
<br />
Xarxos looked into the mirror. What looked back was an anthropomorphic fox with disproportionately long ears and light beige fur – a fennec fox, Xarxos realized. Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for Xarxos to see why this new body was so restricted – a muzzle enclosed its mouth while its hands were bound in tight leather gloves.<br />
<br />
To Xarxos relief, a glance down revealed a small nub poking out from his fur – a penis! It was tiny, more a nub than a shaft, and when he flicked it with a gloved hand he felt only the dimmest sensation of pleasure. But micropenis or not, it was still a penis. And as he moved his hand further down, he also felt two small, raisin sized balls. Again, not the best outcome but far better than the one he had escaped. Which only left the question of the pressure in his ass – a question that was soon answered as his mitted hand felt a smooth rubber disc protruding but from butthole. A butt plug.<br />
<br />
A butt plug?<br />
<br />
Did this body belong to a prisoner? If so, why the butt plug? Or… Xarxos thoughts were interrupted as he heard a distant voice seep quietly through the concrete wall.<br />
<br />
“Maynard,” it said, “go get the gimp.”<br />
<br />
“You want me to lube him up this time?”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long before the sound of laughter echoes through the walls of Xarxos’ room.<br />
<br />
BAD END</p>
