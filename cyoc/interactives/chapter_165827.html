<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the end of the meal, everyone was starting to feel a little tipsy. Dan found himself sitting next to Phil who had become a little withdrawn as the night wore on. He seemed worn out by the banter, particularly the jokes about his skimpy dress and girly smooth face.<br />
Concerned that the birthday boy was looking a little morose, Dan asked what was wrong.<br />
<br />
“Oh, nothin&#39; just I have to put up with all the banter all day at work, it can get a little tiring doing the same in the evenin&#39;.” Phil said. “Plus, the jibes about me lookin like a kid really get to me. I get it, I’ve always looked young for my age, if I could grow a beard or summit to make myself look older I would.”<br />
<br />
“that’s ridiculous. Lots of people would kill to look like you.”<br />
<br />
“yeah well.in the building trade it doesn’t pay to look like you’re a pretty boy or anything. Just makes you the target of jokes. Don’t get me wrong though I can give as good as I get and Im ok most of the time. Just can’t deal with putting up with the banter on my downtime as well.”<br />
<br />
Dan calmed down, a little relieved that hear he hadn’t ruined Phil’s self esteem or whatever.<br />
<br />
They were quiet a while, then Phil turned to him and asked, “Dan, can I ask you summit? You like guys, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” Dan said wondering if he was going to find out the results of the mental swap.<br />
<br />
“what is it like? I mean, how do you know you like guys?”<br />
<br />
“The same way you know you’re into girls. I see a guy and I look at his face, his body, his crotch. I like what I see and I want to explore what’s underneath. When I see a girl, I just see the girl. There’s now desire to see her body or to get any closer to her simply because of how she looks. Why?”<br />
<br />
“See that’s what I always thought about liking girls,” Phil said. “But since lunchtime, I’ve felt different. Had a coffee date with a lass I’ve been seeing for a few weeks. Bangin&#39; tits...”, he held his hands out as if cupping a set of invisible globes. “Great snatch too. Best fuck I’ve ever had. But today I was sitting there looking at her, looking at her norks and I felt nothing. Didn’t want to feel them at all. The thought of eatin her out or anything like that made me feel sick to be honest. Never felt that way about fucking a bird before.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Dan said. “maybe she just wasn’t the right person for you. Plenty more fish and all that.”<br />
<br />
“yeah, well none of the girls I passed on the way back to work did anything for me either. And there were plenty of hot college chicks around, know what I m saying? But, the weird thing was, when I got back to the site, it wasn’t the girls that caught my eye, but the new kid we got working with us – the apprentice.”<br />
<br />
“A guy? Young guy?” Dan leaned forward, excited that Phil was effectively coming out to him and so quickly. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’s just this scrawny little 18 year old kid, sticks for arms, bumfluff on his face, waist skinny enough you could circle it with both hands. Nothing special, but God I wanted nothing more than...”<br />
<br />
Phil paused as if unable to articulate what he wanted to say.<br />
<br />
“What did you want?”<br />
<br />
Phil coughed, looked around for eavesdroppers, then said in a low voice. “well, I wanted to feel his hands on my body. I wanted him to explore me, the way I explored Sandy with the tits. I wanted dick inside me.”<br />
<br />
“Is that all you wanted him to do?”<br />
<br />
“No, I wanted to do more, I wanted to suck him off, wanted him to go down on me until I nut but I also wanted him to fuck me senseless.&quot;<br />
<br />
“what about other guys? Did you feel that way about your other workmates?”<br />
<br />
“Well there are plenty of fit guys on our job. We all head to the gym after work and many of us have decent bods. But most of them are in their 30s or 40s.”<br />
<br />
“But you’re in your 30s.”<br />
<br />
“I know, it’s weird. Buy I was looking at these fit guys my own age and I had the strong feeling they were too old for me. I felt like I needed a college kid. Someone your age, you know?”<br />
<br />
With that, Phil put his hand on Dan’s knee, sliding it gently up the inside of his thigh, feeling the soft skin just inside his shorts.<br />
Dan enjoyed the sensation of Phil’s rough workman’s hands on his sensitive skin, struggling to control his own little hard on now. It seemed that, when he swapped Phil with the jogger on campus, he’d made it so that Phil was not only attracted to men now, he was attracted to the type of guys the girl was attracted to, dudes her own age which for Phil meant guys a decade younger, young twinky guys like Dan in Tim’s old body. <br />
<br />
Phil’s hand lingered just below Dan’s midget tent, which Dan was grateful for. He wasn’t quite sure how Phil would react to his tiny cock yet and didn’twant to derail this burgeoning relationship before it got going. Keen to show Phil’s interest was reciprocated, Dan placed his hand on Phil’s thigh in turn, slipping his hand up Phil’s skimpy girls shorts lightly brushing the head of his hardening monster dick through the cotton of his girls panties.<br />
<br />
Phil gasped with barely concealed delight.<br />
<br />
“Come back to my room with me,” Phil said. “I want to explore whatever it is I’m feeling right now and I wanna do it with you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I want that too,” Dan said, keeping his hand between Phil’s legs. Someone called for Dan to settle a debate, and another called for a round of shots. Phil and Dan’s liaison would have to do wait a little while longer.<br />
 <br />
*<br />
<br />
Dan sat through the rigmarole of splitting the bill, impatient to get back to the dorm so he could play with his new toy. He amused himself by swapping out the deep sexy voice of one of his dorm mates who was quibbling annoyingly over the cost of his share with that of one of the waitresses who had a rather shrill piercing tone. Dan hoped it would make Reg a little less talkative in future. In fact he was already coughing trying bring his voice down an octave. <br />
<br />
Dinner finally over, the group went back to the dorm. Nodding at Phil to give a private signal Dan went into his room to wait for the hall to clear. Satisfied it was empty, he went back out walked up to Phil’s door and knocked. Phil answered it straight away, as if he had been waiting just the other side, still wearing his open shirt and skimpy girls jogging shorts. Immediately, Phil grabbed Phil’s head and pulled him into a deep desperate kiss, like a diver gulping air. He paused to pull Dan in and closed the door. Dan held up his hand in a signal to stop. He wanted to admire Phil for moment, taking in his muscles, the satin of his flesh, the cut of his cheekbones, his lustrous dark hair, the turn of his hairless legs, the way his meaty cock -clearly fully hard - strained his tiny shorts. Phil was a work of art, a wank bank fantasy brought to life.<br />
<br />
Slipping his hands inside Phil’s shirt to caress his sides, Dan pulled Phil in for a passionate kiss of his own, enjoying the sensation of Phil melting into his arms, enjoying the feel of Phil’s hard length pressing against his stomach while his own pressed against Phil’s leg.<br />
<br />
“Someone is pleased to see me,” Dan remarked with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely!” Phil replied.<br />
<br />
Dan began to undress Phil, slipping the shirt from his shoulders and dropping it to the floor. Phil reciprocated, unbuttoning his shirt as quickly as he could, before turning to Dan’s shorts, unbuttoning the fly. He slipped his hand in to rub Dan’s hard little pecker. Dan stiffened, suddenly worried how Phil would respond to his mediocre member. <br />
<br />
But Phil didn’t seem bothered. he continued to caress Dan’s dick with one hand while shucking his shorts down with the other. He kissed Dan on the lips then got down on his knees and pulled Dan’s briefs down, revealing very little Dan.<br />
<br />
Phil licked his lips then immediately took the little cock into his mouth, began sucking enthusiastically. Dan was overcome by the intense pleasure. He tapped Phil on the shoulder when he felt himself getting too close and Phil leaned back.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, that was tasty,”phil said. “just perfect.”<br />
<br />
“Perfect?” Dan asked puzzled.<br />
 <br />
“I can’t explain it, but your cock is just perfect. Exactly what ive been fantasising about all day. I was worried you&#39;d be too big.”<br />
<br />
Dan smirked be inwardly. Apparently the girl whose sexuality had been swapped with Phil’s preferred little dicks. Maybe she was tight and bigger cocks intimidated her.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t think you’d be so worried dick size? Don’t want the competition?”<br />
<br />
Phil blushed, mumbled, “no I was just worried you wouldn’t fit... inside.” He laughed and Dan laughed encouragingly.<br />
<br />
“Well don’t worry, Ill be gentle. I guess this means I’m topping then.”<br />
<br />
Dan took Phil’s hand and led him to the bed pushed him down on it. He explored Phil’s smooth body, his  kissing as he went. He rubbed Phil’s impressive soldier through the girls jogging bottoms feeling it harden in his hand. He hooked his thumbs in the waist band, slid down first the shorts then the panties, goggling at how tight they were. As the stretched, straining cotton knickers were pulled down, a girthy uncut dick sprang almost comically to attention. Dan licked his lips as he admired his prize – it looked to be over 8 inches in length and disproportionately thick and meaty for its length. The head peeped shyly from the folds of the foreskin, and the juicy balls hund pendulously between Phil’s muscular thighs. But the best bit for Dan was the sight of that impressively masculine member completely denuded of hair. <br />
<br />
Phil guessed Dan was contemplating his hairlessness, said, “i don’t get much hair down there anyway, it’s less embarrassing to wax it.”<br />
<br />
Dan licked his lips said, “looks perfect to me.” Without hesitation, he dived on it, taking as much of it into his mouth as he could, showing Phil how to give a good blow job, scarcely believing that in the space of a few hours, he’d managed to bag himself a night with such a hot, manly piece like Phil.</p>
