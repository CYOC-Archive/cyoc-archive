<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dylan tried his best to avoid his sister. As soon as he started a new load of laundry he got out of the house as quickly as he could. It was embarrassing to still be wearing the now twice-stained panties, but the rest of his clothes wouldn&#39;t be done for at least an hour or two. He tried to keep himself busy, he tried to go about his day as normal, but his thoughts were back at home with Karen.<br />
<br />
Dylan still couldn&#39;t believe what happened. He knew Karen had a bit of a reputation for sleeping around but he had never seen that side of her before. As vivid as anything he could see her standing in front of him wearing nothing but her underwear - her curves were in all the right places, she perfectly filled out her bra like he had never imagined. He never thought of her that way before now, but now she was all he could think of. Even visions of Cindy from the night before were swiftly replaced with new ones of Karen. The way she kissed him made him feel tight in the chest, and it hadn&#39;t taken long for his little soldier to recover - he could feel that now familiar tiny stiffness pressing against his panties.<br />
<br />
But he didn&#39;t know what happened now. She told him they would try again this evening, would he finally lose his virginity? He never expected it would be to Karen, but now he couldn&#39;t imagine anyone else. As he carelessly flipped through magazines at a local corner store, he caught a couple of girls he knew from school stealing glances at him and laughing to each other. Instinctively he looked down to see if the lines of his panties were showing, but they were well hidden. What were they laughing about? Karen had seen Cindy&#39;s picture, had these girls seen it too? Without lingering on the question too long, Dylan put back the magazine he was holding and swiftly left the store, he could hear the girls&#39; laughter grow louder as he left.<br />
<br />
It was now 6pm, and Dylan finally decided to head back home. His heart was beating out of his chest. He was terrified Karen would pretend not to remember her promise to him this morning. Hell, he was terrified she would. Would he even be able to make it to sex this time? He couldn&#39;t even handle her barely rubbing him off. If this was going to happen, he needed to prepare himself. He needed to get out of these panties and be a man, and show Karen - no, show the world - that size truly did not matter. He pictured her moaning as he plunged himself into her - the imagination of a young man in love can really run wild.<br />
<br />
Karen wasn&#39;t in the kitchen when he got home, he quietly stepped into the hallway - her door was closed, and there was no sound throughout the house. He tip-toed through the hallway to the laundry room, and went to retrieve his regular underwear. He shuffled through the clothing in the dryer, but all he found were shirts, shorts, socks, pants... where was his underwear?<br />
<br />
Suddenly he felt a pair of arms wrap themselves around his waist - Karen had crept up behind him. &quot;Welcome home&quot;, she cooed. Dylan turned around in her arms and she kissed him as his face came to hers. Her lips were perfectly level with his - wasn&#39;t he taller than her? He peeked down to her feet to see if she was wearing heels or standing on her tip-toes but her bare feet were flat on the floor. Dylan tried to be the man he knew he had to be right now, he broke off the kiss and asked her assertively &quot;Karen, have you seen where my underwear went?&quot;. The question sounded ridiculous. A mischievous smile planted itself on Karen&#39;s lips. &quot;Come on&quot;, she said, &quot;I have them in my room&quot;, then she took her arms back from around him and walked back to her room, gently swaying her waist from side to side and peeking back at him to see if he was staring. Of course he was. When she got back to the door she called back &quot;But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need them&quot;. She walked in to her room and shut the door.<br />
<br />
Dylan forgot all about the underwear, it didn&#39;t matter now. His little wiener was as hard as it could possibly be, and he made his way down the hallway and opened her door. The lights were dimmed, and Karen was already stripped to her bra and panties and on the bed - that was quick. Dylan stepped in. &quot;Dylan&quot;, she said softly, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking, and there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to do with you...&quot;.</p>
