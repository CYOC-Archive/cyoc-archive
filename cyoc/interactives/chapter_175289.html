<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike had sudden inspiration as he was foing over the endless possibilities before him. He had always wondered what it would be like to explore his father’s body and he didn’t know why this option hadn’t come to him sooner.<br />
<br />
Mike’s entire family was out doing different things and by his estimation they would be out of the house for hours. <br />
<br />
Mike’s parents lived in separate rooms as they are divorced yet wanted to raise the kids together. Mike crept into his father’s bedroom inhaling the cologne and manly musk of the setting. <br />
<br />
“Now, what piece of clothing should I use to transform my body..” Mike wondered aloud. Since he wanted a full lower body transformation he stripped off all of his lower garments and grabbed a pair of used dress slacks and a pair of socks from the floor. Once he put these articles on he laid down on his dad’s bed and immediately felt his body transforming. <br />
<br />
Not even ten seconds went by and the magical tingling sensation was gone. He could tell his lower body had transformed bc the slacks that had been so loose on him a minute ago were now tight to his skin. <br />
<br />
Mike didn’t want to spoil the surprise so he didn’t examine his lower body just yet. Instead he went to his mom’s room and grabbed a pair of lace panties. Since she had a larger frame these should fit his new parts. He went back to his dad’s manly smelling room to find out.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes he took off the pants and socks and put on the soft lace underwear. The moment of truth was upon him and Mike opened his eyes facing his dad’s full length mirror. <br />
<br />
His dad’s build was muscular with just the right amount of fat. This made Mike’s new bubble butt look incredible. “I never thought I’d be able to see dad’s ass in something so slutty” said mike aloud. <br />
<br />
Turning his body he saw his dad’s little cock and balls cupped together by the lacy fabric. “Dad’s only got two inches soft! It’s okay little buddy, I won’t tell anyone,” said Mike affectionately to his dad’s pecker. The flattery must’ve triggered the little guy cause he grew to five inches hard, only a couple inches short of what Mike’s original penis maxes out at.<br />
<br />
Mike got on his dad Warren’s bed, still panty clad, and ass facing the mirror. He moved the back of the panties exposing Warren’s hole. “I could play with this for hours” the horny young man marveled. He stayed there on all fours playing with his dads hole for about a half an hour. The lube in the nightstand helped tremendously.<br />
<br />
As Mike was lost in sexploration he didn’t even notice Warren himself come into the room until he saw him in the mirror. Something was strange though, Warren was holding up his pants and looking a bull who just saw red. <br />
<br />
“What are you doing in my room??” Yelled Warren as if it wasn’t obvious that Mike was masturbating on his bed. “And is that... is that my lower body?? I was out shopping when all of the sudden my pants didn’t fit and I was three inches shorter!”<br />
<br />
“Gee dad I have no idea how this happened!” Mike lied, really selling it.<br />
<br />
“Well what reason did you have for dressing up my lower body in panties?!? And masturbating in my room??” Warren asked, justified.<br />
<br />
“It’s just that you have such a big booty. I swear I didn’t know it was yours and your room just has a better mirror than mine,” said Mike in his defense.<br />
<br />
“I’m not buying it. I bet you did something to make this happen to us and you wanted to explore your old man’s body” said Warren<br />
<br />
Shit he had been caught. Mike started rubbing his new daddy cheeks in ecstasy, “Well you can explore my lower body too you know, it’s not a one was street”.<br />
<br />
Warren was still angry but feeling conflicted. Was that big round ass really his former one. Warren looked at the mirror and took off his pants and underwear admiring his new slender lower body. “I guess I did get something out of it..” said Warren admiring his bigger cock, which started hardening as he looked at it.<br />
<br />
“That’s the spirit dad”, said Mike, now fingering his new hole again. <br />
<br />
“Well I don’t know how you did it but you deserve to be punished for what you did still” said Warren<br />
<br />
“How about instead of a punishment I let you fuck this bubble butt and we call it even” said Mike, hoping to get dick from his former dick.<br />
<br />
Warren couldn’t help but take him up on the offer, his former ass was just too juicy to pass up. He put his son’s dick into his former ass with relative ease and moaned at the stimulation. Mike moaned softly as well<br />
<br />
Before long they were pumping hard for a good forty minutes and both very close to cumming. Suddenly their lower bodies switched back, the magic must have worn off! They both saw it happen but Warren was pumping too hard to stop, he creamed in his son’s ass while his son creamed on the bed.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe it, I came in my son,” moaned Warren, “It was one thing when I was fucking my own ass... I’m sorry son”<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding?? That was the hottest orgasm I’ve ever had. Please don’t tell me this was a one time thing” begged Mike.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I’m gonna say this but I doubt if I could say no to doing this again,” said Warren, blushing. “And it was kind of hot to have your bigger cock. You just have to tell me how you switched our parts. If you don’t you can kiss us having sex again goodbye.”<br />
<br />
Mike laughed, “that’s a small price to pay dad.”</p>
