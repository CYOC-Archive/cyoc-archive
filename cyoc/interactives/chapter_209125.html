<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you get out to wash your hands thoroughly, two carnies in uniforms, with leashes and animal-holding devices enter, complaining loudly. From what you gather, an animal has escaped. Luckily for all, it is just a female lizard, not violent at all, and the carnies gripe about it not being the first time it has happened. From what you can gather, it is because that she-lizard is upset at not having a cub and that makes her restless. Maternal instincts and all of that. As a result, she get out when she is not supposed to, getting weird ideas in her head. <br />
As you go out, a bit wary at the idea of a lizard around, even if friendly, something grazes your arm and stings you. You wince and slap at your arm, hoping to have killed the stupid insect. But there&#39;s nothing. Damn! You can only wish for the sting not to scratch too much. Yet as you go looking for your pals, you get tired. Your head starts spinning. You sit down but the effects don’t want to go away. Did you eat something bad? Maybe. <br />
&quot;Hey, kid, are you all right? You look kinda woozy.&quot;<br />
It&#39;s one of the trainers from the restroom.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess I am,&quot; you say, clutching your forehead.  <br />
&quot;Let me take you to the infirmary,&quot; says the carnie. &quot;You can rest and get examined there. It&#39;ll be safer than fainting in front of everyone and risking getting harmed.&quot;<br />
That sounds safer, yes. You accept and he guides you to the infirmary. On the way, you ask if the lizard that has escaped had been caught. He says that yes, everything is under control and that soon she will be right as rain. She&#39;ll get babies very soon and be a lot more docile. He makes you lie down on a typical doctor bed and asks you to relax. That a nurse will come right away. You nod. You really feel not well at all. Nauseous. The bed is a usual hospital bed but it&#39;s better to be lying down at the moment. You stare at he wall and close your eyes to keep the world from spinning. So when you lose consciousness, you don&#39;t even realize it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that worked to a tee.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t believe you even doubted me.&quot;<br />
&quot;All obedient now, like I predicted.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I hope it works out because...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey, I can&#39;t believe you doubted me for so long! I was right, as usual.&quot;<br />
&quot;When she returns, we&#39;ll...&quot;<br />
You regain consciousness slowly. You feel so weak and tired. You can hear sounds above you and others far away. Your eyes have trouble adjusting though... Sounds of clapping and of a spectacle can be heard far off. What happened? Let&#39;s see... You were at  the infirmary, last thing you can recall. And then... Then... You didn&#39;t drink illegally or fight and you were on a bed and... And you&#39;re lying on straw? With... With bars surrounding you? With a lock at the door? And why is everyone so big and tall? You were drugged! Drugged without your knowledge and certainly abused! You shout out you fear and confusion but only comes out as high-pitched plaintive cries. What&#39;s wrong with your throat? And it&#39;s caught the attention of the carnies too.<br />
&quot;Damn it! Make him shut up, or else...&quot;<br />
A carnie bangs on what appears to be your cage. You feel happy when he gets a reprimand out of it.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t do that, you moron! It&#39;s sure to...&quot;<br />
Then a commotion is heard, with words hastily spoken from a microphone. A gigantic figure looms over your cage...and you. It&#39;s a lizard all right, but more like a dragon, with dorsal spikes and dark green scales. Two horns adorn its head and its eyes are red. It also has wings atop its back, It&#39;s staring right at you and presses its snout against the bars of the cage, rattling it. It sniffs you out, rumbling deeply.<br />
&quot;I had to sort of end the show abruptly. She became agitated and got nervous and angry. I did what I could to...&quot; says a fat carnie as he rushes in, out of breath. <br />
&quot;Robert here was stupid enough to bang on the cage of the brat,&quot; grumbles another.<br />
&quot;Good thing everyone things are monsters are puppets and illusions,&quot; sighs the fat carnie.<br />
So that thing is female. A lizard, really! No wonder they had to find it fast! So all these monsters are real? Seriously? However, you had already guessed that beast was female. Its pheromones told you so. Instinctively, you can guess what this beast feels and its basic thoughts and emotions. You wonder how it&#39;s possible but then you feel literally drowned under desires of contact, affection, love and reassurances. That scaly monster doesn&#39;t want to eat you but... cuddle you! And in its obstinacy of reaching you, it&#39;s gripping and shaking the cage! Someone get you out of here! She follows you without pause whichever corner of the cage you take refuge in! And from your movements, you see that you&#39;ve got scales and talons and a tail too! Only of a darker green than the female dragon. Help! Someone! It must be a mistake!A terrible mistake! Did you die from drinking booze and get reincarnated or something like that? Your cries only seem to anguish the she-dragon even more. So a carnie pushes her aside with difficulty and opens up the cage. He grabs you and hands you over to her.<br />
&quot;See, Doucette? Now you have a baby just for you. So you&#39;ll be good, right? You&#39;ll be a good girl?&quot;<br />
Doucette grabs you by the middle, like any mother dog would do, and trots back to a n enormous cage where she settles contentedly, all calm restored now that she had you safe and near. Her determination to keep you near is overwhelming. And as she returns happily to her home, you hear the carnies behind you.<br />
&quot;She already seems more obedient. Calmer. Where did you find the little dragon?&quot;<br />
&quot;We just grabbed a random kid and injected him with a transformation serum. Easier than finding a real dragon. And we have a nice future attraction.&quot;<br />
&quot;The kid has still got his memories?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, not a chance.&quot;<br />
So you were transformed! All to please a mother dragon lacking motherhood! Hey! You have to get out of that monster&#39;s clutches and find help! The carnie said you were supposed to not remember your past life but you do so there&#39;s still hope. <br />
<br />
The hope you&#39;re holding fades away fast. Your new mother doesn&#39;t leave you. She never leaves you. She nuzzles you lovingly and cuddles you  and showers you with affection. In fact, she bombards you with her motherly concerns and cares. You discover that you do not possess wings but that you have webbed paws. That does not stop her from licking you, hugging you and nuzzling you for hours on end. Her constant calls of &quot;my beautiful baby dragon&quot; or &quot;my pretty all warm dragonling&quot; swim in your mind all the time. It&#39;s getting hard to resist and to recall you were anything else than what she call you constantly. It&#39;s painful to recall what you were before. Too saddening. And when you are sad, the she-dragon tightens her love and reassurances, reinforcing the problem. It&#39;s simpler to give up altogether. She feeds you bowls of warm milk and chews raw meat and fish for you. And now you love fish and seafood. If you&#39;re not hungry, she forces the food into your mouth and when your belly is full, she pokes it gently, pats it and rubs it lovingly, the pleasure of having a well-fed baby, the pride of it, emanating from her clearly. She holds you to her warm chest as often as she can and kisses you. It&#39;s easier to let it happen. You&#39;ve learned resisting just makes things more uncomfortable. If you try to escape her and show you don&#39;t want to be her little baby, she tickles you until you are breathless and a giggling mess. Then, utterly exhausted, you are fully malleable and she chan treat you like a pliable little doll, incapable of doing anything else that she wants. And when you really don&#39;t want and snap back, she sits on her haunches and presses you against her privacy, right against her slit. She makes you stay there, pats you and sends you waves of motherly love. She wants you to to believe that&#39;s where you came from. She wishes for you to believe you were never adopted. That you are her fresh and blood. The baby she loves.  It&#39;s disgusting but she holds you gently yet firmly. You cannot escape and like for the rest, it&#39;s easier to just surrender. Surrender to her words and waves of affection. She is loving and she means well, right? And it&#39;s not like your own mother was as protective and watchful, right? No one&#39;s been looking for you or found you so she&#39;s the only one who cares about you. The carnies just feed you and will be happy when you do tricks for them. She loves you for who you are. Simply that. She holds you close and when you hug back, she is so, so supportive and loving. Everyone treats you like a baby dragon and you weren&#39;t as cherished as a human, anyway. Could be worse, as a dragon. A much better mommy is there just for you. To pamper you and at least, she worries about you. So you sleep in her arms and wallow in her love and letting your past memories float away. If you are to start a new life forcibly, then it might as well being with a loving mommy who adores your very presence.</p>
