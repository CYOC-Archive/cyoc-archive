<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>A few days passed. Steven was still
far from used to her new body, let
<i>alone</i> the idea of possibly being
stuck this way, but the initial shock that
had returned each time she woke up for the
first couple days had pretty much faded.
Over this time, she had developed a taste
for very spicy food, which she remembered
from the manga as an Oni trait. It was
both frightening and comforting; it was a
part of herself she'd lost, since Steven
had always preferred a minimum of
capsaicin in his food, but on the bright
side, it was, thus far, the <i>only</i>
part of herself she'd lost, and something
quite minor at that. If she had to lose
something, at least it wasn't anything
<i>important.</i></p>
<p>And she <i>was</i> making progress,
slowly. Bit by bit, she was at least
starting to come to terms with her new
body; she'd had to learn to use the
bathroom as a girl the day after her
change, and a couple days later she'd
worked up the courage to start taking
showers again. It had helped that her
mother hadn't brought up the looming
spectre of Life As A Girl since that first
afternoon. Steven was still far from happy
about her situation, but at least things
were finally beginning to stabilize.</p>
<p>Steven was in her room, sorting through
the bag of manga she'd bought that fateful
night; she hadn't touched it since, and
was only now getting it on the bookshelf.
Things were going just fine until she
finished the bag and realized she was a
volume short. She double-checked the
receipt against the contents of the
bokkshelf; sure enough, one of her import
items, a volume of <i>Neko De Gomen,</i> a
series about a girl who is turned into a
cat-girl by her mad-scientist father, was
missing. It wasn't in the bag, and it
wasn't in the car, either...so where could
it have gone?</p>
<p>Steven was distracted from her
conundrum by the sound of a car coming up
the driveway. Looking out her bedroom
window, she saw that it was the
nondescript vehicle of the Men in Black.
Well, there was no need to be secretive
around them, so she opened the window and
flew out, descending gently towards the
ground in front of the car. Flying was the
one thing Steven actually liked about her
changes; it was actually much easier to
get comfortable in the air, and she'd
taken to floating in mid-air just about
all the time, except during meals (at her
mother's insistence) and sleep and
bathroom usage (by necessity.) The
downside was that regular clothing did
indeed hamper her flight abilities, and so
she'd had to switch back to pretty much
just the tiger-skin bikini she'd been
provided with and the ones she'd bought,
but she felt it was a worthwhile tradeoff.
Steven was still set on changing back, but
she hoped she could retain this ability if
possible.</p>
<p>It didn't look like Agent Fields was
here to break any news about changing
back, though; his expression, although
almost as reserved as usual, was too grim
for good news. He waited until Steven's
mother had come out before acknowledging
their greetings.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "I think you ought to
know that HQ has finished your official
story, and you will be receiving it in the
form of a medical case document shortly.
But I'm afraid the real reason we're here
is to ask for your help."</p>
<p>Steven and her mother gaped. "I'm
sorry?" Steven's mother replied. "You? Ask
for <i>our</i> help?"</p>
<p>Agent Fields allowed himself a
half-smile. "It does seem strange, I
admit," he said. "But we're a very
specialized agency, and we can't always
turn to other government offices when we
have a problem we're not equipped to
handle."</p>
<p>Steven's mother nodded. "I suppose
not," she said. "Well, what is it that you
need?"</p>
<p>Fields sighed. "We found a second
victim," he said. "Same engine signature,
and the timing confirms that it was the
same group that changed your son. Not
dissimilar to what happened to Steven,
either, but she's undergone changes that
are a lot harder to explain away. And
unfortunately, her situation tipped her
already strained relationship with her
parents past the breaking point, so she
can't stay at home."</p>
<p>Steven's mother got a compassionate
look on her face. "Well, she can stay with
us," she said. "Steven knows what she's
going through better than anyone."</p>
<p>Fields nodded as Thomson opened the
rear passenger door. "I appreciate the
offer, but I think you should know that
she's not taking this well. She may
be...<i>difficult</i> to deal with."</p>
<p>Steven's mother shook her head. "No.
We'll manage. And we have plenty of room
and quite enough privacy out here to keep
<i>anything</i> they did to her
secret."</p>
<p>Fields smiled a little more. "I had a
feeling you'd say that. Terrence, why
don't you step out and say hello?"</p>
<p>A girl emerged from the car. She looked
mostly normal, except for her angry,
tear-streaked face, and the cat-ears and
tail. Thomson walked over and handed
something to Fields, who approached
Steven. "She had this on her," he said.
"We believe it's yours." He handed her the
missing volume of <i>Neko De
Gomen.</i></p></p>
