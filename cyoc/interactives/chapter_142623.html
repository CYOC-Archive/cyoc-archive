<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt stared down at his noodle cock, then glanced over at the machine, which had reverted to its previous menu. He realized that this machine was real. <br />
<br />
He also realized he wanted more. Matt, like all the other boys at school, knew Bryce, the captain of the football team. The rumor was that he was packing a foot long, and based on the bubble at the front of pretty much everything he wore, it was almost confirmed at this point.<br />
<br />
And now Matt sat with a machine which could literally give him the same experience. And he knew just what to do. Matt reached over and hit the REVERT changes button. He wanted to start off from the beginning. As his cock shrunk back down to its previous size, Matt wondered what size to pick. Should he just settle for a foot, or go bigger? After all, the machine was capable of up to 36 inches... 3 times a foot!<br />
<br />
Matt went back to the menu. He re-entered the SET ADJUSTMENT menu, and was greeted with a similar dialog as before:<br />
<br />
[SUBJECT INFO]<br />
FLACCID LENGTH: 2.4IN<br />
FLACCID WIDTH: 1.2IN<br />
ERECT LENGTH: 5.4IN<br />
ERECT WIDTH: 1.4IN<br />
BALL SIZE COMPARABLE TO: GRAPES<br />
<br />
Matt first tapped on flaccid length. He mashed the up arrow, and kept it held down. 3 inches... 4 inches... 5 inches... the machine warned him that erect size would be increased as well, and he ignored it. 6 inches... 7... 8... 9... 10... 11... 12... Matt hesitated. Should he make it bigger? But then his resolve strengthened. He pressed it again twice, stopping at 14 inches, which he decided was certainly big enough. Exiting back out, he noted that erect size had changed as well.<br />
<br />
However, Matt knew his width was not enough for his length, so he edited that next, setting his flaccid width to 3IN (and his erect width as well).<br />
<br />
Matt finally entered the balls menu. This time, the machine displayed several similar size objects for Matt to choose his size. Matt read down the options:<br />
- PING PONG BALL<br />
- TENNIS BALL<br />
- SOFTBALL<br />
- BOWLING BALL<br />
- BEACH BALL<br />
<br />
Jesus, size queen much, Matt thought, and set his to be &quot;baseball&quot; size. He wanted them big, but not overwhelming.<br />
<br />
Finally, Matt&#39;s finger hovered over the Start button, before he finally pressed it.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened for a few seconds, then Matt felt the familiar suction. This time, it was much stronger. Looking down, Matt saw his cock start to grow, not only longer, but thicker. At this point, it had reached his old size, 6 inches, and wasn&#39;t hard at all.<br />
<br />
Matt suddenly felt pressure in his balls. Looking down, he realized that even though they weren&#39;t in the tube, they were still growing. Before, they had been the size of grapes, but they were bigger than ping pong balls and swelling up by the second.<br />
<br />
Looking now, Matt realized his cock was already much longer than most of the guys in the locker room. It had just reached the 7 inch mark, and was slowly inching its way to a solid 8. It was also noticeably thicker. Matt&#39;s balls now rivaled whiffle balls in size. As his cock and balls grew, Matt experienced pleasure. He gritted his teeth, trying to hold back his climax. But the constant rubbing of his cock as it expanded along the tube and the constant pressure on his now-tennis-ball-sized nuts was making it extremely difficult. Matt&#39;s cock nudged the 10&quot; mark on the tube. It was the biggest cock Matt had ever seen in his life. Veins became more defined along its surface, and its mushroom-shaped head was much bigger. With a start, Matt realized his cock was not only pulsing precum, but releasing much more than he ever had before, a side effect of his larger balls he supposed. Matt felt the pressure on his balls ease up, and looking down, he saw why. His nuts had now reached the size of baseballs. Bulging out in almost a perfect sphere, they seemed perfect in every way. Matt also noticed his balls hung much lower now.<br />
<br />
As Matt&#39;s cock passed the 12&quot; mark, Matt felt a sense of euphoria, as his cock neared the final two inches of growth he felt happy that he was now the owner of the biggest cock in the school! Well, that and the biggest nuts. Matt wondered if they were truly big enough, and resolved to bump them up a size after this growth finished. Speaking of...<br />
<br />
The machine dinged, and the suction eased. With a gasp, Matt slid his cock out of the tube. Out flopped a monstrous fleshy python, thick as a coke can and more than a foot long, and still completely soft. Matt stood up, and the weight of his new genitals caught him off balance.<br />
<br />
Walking around a bit, Matt almost laughed. Without support, his cock whipped from side to side on his legs, while his balls swung around. He wondered if he would fit into his underwear.<br />
<br />
Matt quickly pulled up his underwear that he had taken off to use the pump. Whereas before the underwear&#39;s fabric had contained his cock, it was unable to deal with the excess junk it contained now. His balls basically contained all of the space, and with nowhere to go, his penis snaked out one of the legs and down.</p>
