<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He decided to go into the maternity store. It was an odd choice for some, but for Jeff, it was a weird fetish.<br />
<br />
Jeff had always been jealous of women. The way that they didn’t have to worry about certain things. They had flat genitals in the forms of vaginas, instead of penises that were large, ugly, and hard to keep from doing something that you don’t want them to do. <br />
<br />
Women also had sensitive genitals, way more than what a man could ever experience. Not to mention that it was much easier to shave as well. <br />
<br />
Women had a lot of other perks too, such as breasts that could hold milk. They were also soft, and could also hold things between them if done right.<br />
<br />
Jeff was already getting hard thinking about this, but if this device truly worked, he wouldn’t need to worry about being horny in public again, since he wouldn’t have a penis getting in the way. <br />
<br />
He then continued on his train of thought, of how women had nice long hair where it mattered, and were hairless elsewhere. A woman’s body took work to take care of, but it would be worth it.<br />
<br />
Then there was the fact of childbearing. During his sex ed class, Jeff had always been told that he was lucky to have been born a man. Since men don’t have periods, and a load of other crap. To Jeff, women had always been the lucky ones. To bear children, and carry them. Knowing that a period meant that their body was willing to hold a child for 9 months. Jeff had always been jealous of that, as men could never be the ones to birth children, or hold a legacy in their bodies.<br />
<br />
If this chronivac thing actually worked, then Jeff would know what that felt like in just a few minutes. To be a real woman, to have what was needed to be a mother.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but he always envied pregnant women in particular. To have beautiful round bellies. To have to waddle everywhere you walk. Even to giving birth. Everything about it seemed amazing to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s train of thought came to an end, and he realized the strained tent in his pants. Luckily, there was nobody looking his way. He calmed himself down and retrieved the emitter from his pocket. He then walked into the store named “Mother’s Maternity.”<br />
<br />
When he stepped inside, he scoped out the store. From what he could see, there were maternity dresses and other clothes hanging on racks. Throughout the store were many pregnant women, ranging from around 6-8 months pregnant. They waddled around, all looking at the various clothing.<br />
<br />
“Hello sir, can I help you?” A voice said from Jeff’s side. He was brought out of his daydream rather suddenly.<br />
<br />
“What?” Jeff said. He clearly hadn’t been paying attention. This was also where his heart started beating faster and faster. He was nervous, to be the only guy in a store meant for pregnant women.<br />
<br />
“Can I help you?” The voice said again, but this time, attached to an employee. Jeff looked at her, and read her name tag. It read “Veronica” in large letters. <br />
<br />
“Sir, do you need help finding something?” Veronica said again, with a more annoyed frown on her face. It was clear that she needed to help the customer, that being Jeff, but was slightly annoyed that he hadn’t said anything.<br />
<br />
“Uhh, yeah.” Jeff said, not exactly sure what to say. He had never been in a store like this, so he’s never had to talk with anyone.<br />
<br />
“You look young, are you buying something for a special someone?” Veronica asked him, a bit softer and less annoyed.<br />
<br />
“I guess you could say that.” Jeff said as he gripped the emitter tightly. His penis tented in his jeans, and it was clear that Veronica could see it.<br />
<br />
“Is it a girlfriend or wife?” Veronica asked. She seemed to be rather weirded out, but seeing the tent in Jeff’s jeans was enough to do that.<br />
<br />
“Well, actually, they’re for me.” Jeff said as he pushed the button on the device. It took about a second to scan the nearby area, which would be the store. When the device was done, it made a quiet chime. <br />
<br />
After the device finished, Jeff felt a small electric tingle coming from the device. He felt as it traveled through his hand and arms, into his torso and head, and finally through his lower body.<br />
<br />
“Well, we need to get you to a fitting room. You look to be about 6 months already!” Veronica said and started slowly walking. <br />
<br />
“Huh, oh yeah.” Jeff said as he followed Veronica. He felt rather sluggish all of a sudden, but he followed her nonetheless. <br />
<br />
As he walked, Jeff could feel something in his chest. He felt as his nipples stood erect, and the areolas grew out a bit. Then, almost without warning, Jeff felt his nipples start to push away from his chest. He looked down and saw that more skin was building further away from his chest, pushing outward. He reached a hand up, and it felt rather sensitive. He felt his erect nipples, which were also somewhat sore to the touch. <br />
<br />
“Wow, I have tits!” Jeff said suddenly. He was so enamored with the fact that the device worked, and now he had a pair of D size breasts of his own.<br />
<br />
“Well duh, you gotta feed your kid somehow.” Veronica said as they reached a fitting room. Jeff followed, his breasts bouncing rather vigorously.<br />
<br />
“Ok, now we have to make sure that this will be a perfect fit.” Veronica mentioned. “I’ll be right back to help you into a dress.” She said as she opened a door for Jeff. He stepped into the rather roomy fitting area.<br />
<br />
“Now this is gonna sound weird, but I need you to remove all of your clothes. It’s the best way for us to fit you properly.” Veronica said to Jeff in a sweet tone.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded as Veronica left. When the door clicked shut, Jeff went straight to removing his clothing. As he did, his arms started to feel a bit weird. He looked at them, and noticed as the hair withdrew on them. His hands also squeezed a bit tighter and became much more dainty.<br />
<br />
“So everything about me is going to be the average of the people around me...” Jeff muttered to himself. He observed his new hands, and then brought them up to his now exposed breasts. He played with them for a moment when he felt another change start.<br />
<br />
Jeff had noticed that his hair had grown out a bit. It used to be short, and a dull black color. He used his new hands to grab some of the hair, which now tickled his back, and brought it to his face. It was now a luscious light brown color with hints of blonde.<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled. The device was working, he was finally going to be what he had always dreamed of. His attention was brought back to his changes, however, as his face felt a bit strange.<br />
<br />
The change started with his nose, as it narrowed a fair amount. It then became much softer, and pushed back just a tiny bit. Then, Jeff felt a stinging in his eyes. He watched through a few simple tears as his eyes went from a dull brown, to a vibrant blue. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s face then narrowed a bit, and his skin became softer. His face actually looked a but like a female version of himself, but that would change since he was supposed to be the average of those around him.<br />
<br />
He then felt in his neck, as his Adam’s apple disappeared. He felt as his vocal chords shortened, and thinned. This would permanently change his voice to a much higher pitch.<br />
<br />
“Ok, I’m back.” A voice said behind Jeff. He was startled and almost fell over.<br />
<br />
“Oh, please don’t fall.” The voice said, as Veronica entered the fitting area. She seemed to be holding a variety of clothing, from maternity bras and dresses, and even a few pairs of panties.<br />
<br />
Jeff was then brought to the fact that his changes were only about half done. Although it would only be about two more minutes, he would have to strip in front of this employee.<br />
<br />
“Ok, so we’re gonna try you in a few different outfits. I’m here to help, since it will be a but difficult for you to reach around that belly of yours.” Veronica said as she sorted out some of the clothes.<br />
<br />
“Sounds fair to me.” Jeff said in his new voice. It sounded soft, but also womanly where it needed to be.<br />
<br />
“Ok, now can you sit down for me?” Veronica asked as she motioned to a small bench. Jeff did as she asked, his breasts bouncing around as he sat. He could still see the mirror, which was a plus.<br />
<br />
“Now I’ll help remove those pesky shoes of yours.” Veronica said as Jeff felt the next tingle in his feet. <br />
<br />
As his shoes and socks came off, Jeff saw large, ugly mens feet. Covered in hair, and rather callous. Then, his feet started to squeeze inward, much like his hands. He felt as his toes became a bit smaller, and his feet became about a women’s size 7. They were also much softer than his original feet, as they lost all the hair on them.<br />
<br />
Jeff wiggled his toes, absolutely giddy about some of the next changes. He couldn’t believe what was happening, but was excited. He was also incredibly horny, as his penis tented his jeans. It took everything he had not to jerk off, since he wouldn’t need to deal with it much longer.<br />
<br />
“Now we’re gonna remove your jeans and underwear,” Veronica said, “can you stand up and undo them for me?” Jeff nodded and stood up. He almost fell over to some unknown force, but he already knew what it would be.<br />
<br />
Jeff undid his pants, and Veronica pulled them down, leaving him stark naked. Jeff looked down at his legs and penis, the last things to need to change. His legs were up next though.<br />
<br />
The first change, was that his legs lost all their hair. Leaving just skin. Jeff then felt as his legs shortened a bit, but became a hit more curvy. His thighs expanded a fair amount as well. He now had a pair of fantastically female legs. <br />
<br />
“Ok, now we’re gonna start you out with some bras.” Veronica said. Jeff nodded, wanting to watch the last few changes. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s penis was already hard enough to leak out pre cum. It was the last part before he would be a she. Jeff grabbed it, and started rubbing. He wanted to experience his last male orgasm. Veronica seemed too busy with fitting Jeff’s sore breasts with bras anyway.<br />
<br />
As Jeff rubbed, he felt as his penis slowly started to shrink inward. This part excited him even more as he came. White liquid shooting onto the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that happens sometimes, let me grab something to clean it.” Veronica said as she left a bra on Jeff. She then left the room, and Jeff was out of breath. <br />
<br />
Jeff was feeling a rather arousing sensation as his dick kept shrinking inward. After a few more seconds, it had completely disappeared. Jeff watched as nothing happened, when he suddenly felt his testicles and scrotum start to squeeze. <br />
<br />
The feeling was mostly pleasurable, but was slightly painful at first. Jeff felt as his left testicle squeezed uncomfortably, and then popped up into his body. He doubled over in slight pain, as it still hurt like hell. Then, just as the left one did, the right one followed. After both were comfortably in his body, he felt the extra skin of his scrotum tighten to form smooth genitals.<br />
<br />
Jeff then felt the most pleasurable part of the transformation, as the slit of his new vagina formed. He could feel every moment of it. He felt as the lips formed at the sides, and a clit formed. He felt as the urethral opening formed, and he forced himself to clench it shut, since he didn’t want to pee all over himself.<br />
<br />
He then felt as the vaginal opening formed under the urethral opening. He could feel the cavity opening deeper inside of his body. <br />
<br />
Jeff then felt as his old testicles  were pulled into the shapes of ovaries. He could also feel as these new ovaries were filled with eggs. <br />
<br />
All of these new sensations were making Jeff rather wet, which was yet another new sensation. He reached his hand down to feel his new genital area, which felt rather breezy as well. Just seeing a vagina between his legs made Jeff blush. <br />
<br />
The door to the room opened as Veronica stepped in again. She had cleaning supplies, and a towel.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry ma’am, that kind of stuff happens often here.” Veronica said with a smile. She went and cleaned up the white liquid from the wall.<br />
<br />
“I’m just sorry about that.” Jeff said as he stared into the mirror at his mostly female body. It was absolutely a beautiful sight, and it was his!<br />
<br />
“No worries!” Veronica chimed happily, “sometimes a woman’s body does weird things when we’re expecting!” She said as she finished cleaning up.<br />
<br />
“I’ve just, never done this before.” Jeff said as he felt something in his nether regions.<br />
<br />
“Oh, your first one!” Veronica smiled at Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah.” Jeff said as he turned sideways and watched as his ass bubbled out. It became an almost perfectly round shape. <br />
<br />
“Do you hope it’s a boy or a girl?” Veronica asked. She was prepping one of the dresses for Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I hadn’t thought much of that,” Jeff said, “I guess a girl, both to have a like minded individual, and so that they can live the better life.” Jeff watched Veronica as she finished prepping a dress.<br />
<br />
“Oh? You bring up the best point! Being a woman is way better than being a man!” Veronica said.<br />
<br />
With that, Jeff felt the last physical change happen inside of him. He felt as his uterus started expanding at a rapid rate. He felt as a body formed inside of it.<br />
<br />
At that moment, Jeff’s belly started to stretch outward, almost as if it were going to try and burst out. Luckily, it stopped growing at a certain point to where he guessed that he was about 6 months along. Jeff smiled and rubbed his belly, knowing that he was creating life in his body.<br />
<br />
“Ok, now let’s try this one on.” Veronica said motioning to a dress. Jeff nodded and did a slow walk/waddle to the wall, clutching his belly the while time.<br />
<br />
Jeff then went through and tried on a variety of maternity dresses, and even lingerie. After a bit, he had found a few that he liked.<br />
<br />
“Well ma’am, I hope you like the dresses!” Veronica said as Jeff decided to wear one out. <br />
<br />
“Now will you be paying cash or credit?” Veronica asked Jeff, this took him by surprise, when he suddenly remembered his purse. It had just showed up, and was carrying everything he needed.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled out a small wallet and grabbed out a debit card. He realized he knew everything about it, and then paid for his items. <br />
<br />
“Have a nice day!” Veronica said as Jeff walked out of the store. He smiled as he walked to one of the benches, a few people glancing his way. Nobody seemed to notice that a boy walked in there, and a woman walked out.<br />
<br />
Jeff then pulled out his wallet again, and decided to take a closer look at something that was bothering him. It was his new ID card. He pulled it out and looked. He saw a beautiful image of his female self, and looked over the things such as height and weight.<br />
<br />
He then looked at the name, ‘Vixxie’ was the first name now. He then looked and the gender section, and saw that it said F on it.<br />
<br />
This was when a few memories started flooding in. Not too many at once, and not enough to take over Jeff, but to give him a sense of who he now was.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized that he was now a she, no ifs ands or buts about it. Ask anyone, and they would tell you that he had always been a woman, and if not for the baby growing inside her either.<br />
<br />
Jeff then decided to go by her new name, Vixxie, which she quite liked. It was a name based on foxes, but she found they were cute. <br />
<br />
Vixxie, having become pregnant and beautiful, now decided what to do next.</p>
