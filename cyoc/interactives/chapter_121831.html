<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You smirk at the man as he walks away, what a sexy thing he is. You&#39;d like to give him a piece of your meat, but you smell something. You inhale deeply, taking in the scent. You smell barbecued meats and hotdogs; you smell baked beans and corn. You smell them and your mouth waters. You haven&#39;t had anything to eat tonight, but you don&#39;t have any money. You feel around the pockets of your &quot;borrowed&quot; pants. You reach around to the back and feel something. You fumble around in the pocket and reveal a wallet! Some sucker forgot about it, but in a costume, he&#39;s probably enjoying himself. You open it and look at the driver&#39;s license. It&#39;s a big, bearded guy. He looks like a right and proper bear. If only he were here... you like the look of him.<br />
<br />
You close the wallet and put it back into your tight pocket. You take loud steps out of the shop and follow the scent. You keep sniffing and snorting down the path. Your mouth waters as you walk. You carry yourself along until you stand in front of a restaurant with a big cartoon pig on the front. You lick your lips and walk in. At the front is a female pig, shorter than you and cleaner. She wears jeans and a button-down shirt under a tightly tied apron. She isn&#39;t skinny, but she isn&#39;t fat. Her hips are wide and her midsection only slightly thins above it. &quot;Why, welcome in, sir. I&#39;ll be your server today,&quot; She greets you in a warm southern accent, not too thick, but kind and gentle. She leads you to a booth and slides the table away from the seat to make room for you. You take your seat, gut still pressibg against the edge of the table. She hands you a menu and tells you, &quot;Alright, now. Get comfy while I tell you tonight&#39;s special: now, we&#39;ve got the barbecue blow-out special. It&#39;s got two all beef burgers packed with lettuce, tomatoe, and onions. There are barbecue grilled chicken breasts. There&#39;s a corn on the cob. There&#39;s a big plate of fries and a large soda. That sound good?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, definitely,&quot; you happily agree in your low voice. &quot;Alright, now sit tight while we get your food,&quot; she walks off after jotting down your order on a notepad. You wait, licking your lips and rubbing your rumbling gut in anticipation. You take in the smells of the restaurant. You get hungrier with each breath, the comforting scents of sweet corn, tangy barbecue, juicy beef, and greasy fries filling your nose. You get so hungry that you begin to imagine what it will be like to finally eat all of that food. You look around at other people with their food, some in costume some not. You see them bite into the flavorful meats, juice dripping at the corner of their mouths. They&#39;re all smiling, delighted at all of this. Your stomach rumbles again, loudly; you don&#39;t think you can wait much longer. You pat your hands impatiently on the table. You anxiously hum random tunes to pass the time. You crane your neck to look at the people coming out of the kitchen. You yearn for your meal. At last, from the kitchen emerges that pleasant little woman. <br />
<br />
Your server walks to you, holding a large tray filled with plates. She places the tray on a stool, and you stare at the steaming foods on them. She lays out your chicken, burgers, fries, corn, and soda. &quot;Enjoy, hun,&quot; She smiles at you and walks back to the kitchen, tray and stool in hand. You look at her cute butt and curly little tail as she goes. Licking your lips, whether at her or the food, you don&#39;t know. You turn your face back to the table. You gaze at your feast. With this, you could feed three people completely, but it&#39;s all for you. You notice that she never gave you utensils, but what do you care? You&#39;d just like to eat. You lift a large burger and open your mouth wide. You place it between your jaws and bite down. You crunch through the vegetables and find the meat. The beef patty is giant and exploded with juice and flavor in your mouth. You feel frozen in that first bite. You close your lips and chew. Only more flavor comes out with each moment. You mash up the food, juices soaking into the bun. You chew until you begin to look strange. You finally swallow that first bite and exhale loudly, smiling. <br />
<br />
You look at the burger, and there is already a third of it gone. Is that one bite for you? Looks like you&#39;re built for eating big. You take another large bite, savoring the flavor. You swallow much more quickly, now. You shove the last bite of it into your mouth and chew. You swallow hard and lean back. &quot;Mmmmmm...&quot; you sit comfortable, but you&#39;re still hungry. You rub your gut and quietly wonder, &quot;Is it bigger?&quot; You don&#39;t think on it much, and take a bite of the second burger. By now, a normal man would be stuffed, but you could eat five more like it. You finish off the second burger and lean back again. Rubbing your belly, &quot;That&#39;s definitely bigger,&quot; You sit up, and your gut is visibly pushed into by the table, but you like it. You like the idea of putting on more weight. You push aside the burger plate and pull the chicken in front of you.<br />
<br />
You lift the whole thing in your boar hand, getting barbecue sauce all over it. You bite down on the chicken and rip off half of it, tearing in with your large tusks. You chew up the tender meat, the spicy and tangy sauce sliding off onto your tongue. The hot meat warms you up, and you feel the warmth in your belly as well. You swallow it down and push the other half into your waiting mouth. You eat it happily and swallow. You lick the sauce from your messy lips. You then shove your whole hand into your mouth, licking off the sauce and salty dirt. You wipe your saliva from your hand onto your pants and pick up the plate. You bring it to your face and lick up the sauce, snorting rudely. You lick it clean and put it atop the burger plate. Next is the corn on the cob.<br />
<br />
You lift the steaming corn in your hands. You get the melted butter and salt on both hands. You then go to town on it. You lean forth, pressing your gut into the table more. You bite into the corn and go into a frenzy. You bite off corn quickly, moving all along the cob. Much of the corn falls onto your gut, making a mess. You snort as your sloppily eat the corn, burning through it. By the time you&#39;ve eaten it all, a mess of butter and corn is dripping from your hands and sticking on your gut. You place the corn cob down and lick your hands clean of the sweet butter and corn. You then pick up the corn and butter on your gut and eat that. You wipe your hands on your pants and stack the plate on the others. You reach for the fries, struggling to reach past your gut. You break a sweat retrieving it, but pick up the plate. <br />
<br />
You see the plate and waste no time lifting it to your face. You open up your mouth and just pour the fries in. The greasy little things just slide down in. They fall into your mouth in a large pile and you shut your mouth. You chew up the fries, grease dripping out of your mouth and wetting your chin. You mash up the potatoes and swallow it all. It lands in your stomach, a big wad of fatty potato slices. You wipe your face and wipe your hand on your dirty pants. You reach your hand far over to your large glass of soda. You take it and chug the whole thing. The cool, bubbly liquid slides down your throat and rehydrates you after all that eating. You down the last few drops and put the glass back on the table. You lean back again and bring your hands to your engorged gut. Honestly, you aren&#39;t full. You could eat another round of the same thing before being full. Maybe you will... Maybe, maybe not. You massage your gut. You feel bubbling in your stomach. You knead your stomach, working the bubbles out. They all start to rise together. You keep rubbing, and they reach your throat. A little more, and they&#39;ve begun to come out. Your mouth is forced open as gas violently pushes itself out. Your cheeks ripple and your chins jiggle. A deep, guttural and loud burp escapes you. People begin to stare. Five seconds, and you still aren&#39;t finished. After seven seconds, the burps finally ends, and people giggle and snicker at you. You, however, couldn&#39;t care less. You smile, you feel much better after letting that out. Your waitress comes by again, &quot;I see you&#39;ve enjoyed yourself, anything else for tonight? Dessert? Round two? What&#39;ll it be, hun?&quot;</p>
