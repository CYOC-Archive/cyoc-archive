<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The archmage pulled a crystal down off of one of his shelves and passed it in front of the trio. It shined brightly as he did so and he stared at it with glee. &quot;Yes. As I thought. You three have a well-formed bond with each other, your souls have harmonized. I needed something like this for something I wanted to experiment on.&quot; Setting the crystal down, he shrugged out of his robe, like a man about to get to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, I need a good idea of my materials.&quot; He waved a hand in front of the cage and the clothes melted off all three frat brothers. &quot;Obviously, you&#39;ll be the physical base.&quot; He said as he stepped up in front of Mark, eyeing his muscled frame up and down. &quot;We&#39;ll need to use the others to improve on it, but it is the best starting place.&quot; His eyes dropped down between Mark&#39;s legs. He actually wasn&#39;t all that well-endowed and was actually a little below average. &quot;Mostly.&quot; He looked into Mark&#39;s angry expression. &quot;Something to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Mark found his voice again. &quot;We&#39;re not your play things, someone is going to notice us...&quot; And then at another gesture his ability to speak was gone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re in the faerie realm in the kingdom of the beastmen, none of your human friends or family are going to find you unless they&#39;re coming to join us.&quot; The archmage shook his head. &quot;But that spirit of yours is good, I&#39;ll need to make sure that stays front and center. But this one..&quot; He moved to step in front of James. &quot;You&#39;re the smart one, I&#39;ll need your brain to be the core.&quot; James shrinked back a little, thinking he was going to have his brain cut out by this madman.. madrabbitman.. whatever. &quot;Mm.. and the best cock of the bunch. At least one of you is impressive there, I&#39;d hate for my creation to displease the king. That raunchy old lion does love his guards to be well-endowed. It&#39;ll be less work to bring it up to par.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then on to Chris, who still sat on the ground where he had been dropped all tied up. The ropes were gone now, but the arrow still jutted out of his shoulder. A few words and a quick gesture from the archmage and the arrow vanished leaving not even a wound. &quot;So scared. But don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not unimportant. You&#39;re the glue that&#39;s going to hold these two together. You&#39;ll be the..&quot; He paused and considered. &quot;Well, the heart I guess is the best way to put it. Propped up by your friend&#39;s backbone here.&quot; He nodded towards Mark.<br />
<br />
The archmage stepped away from the cage and went over to a collection of vials on his workbench. &quot;First, we need to get the three of you primed and ready to go.&quot; He plucked one of the vials and tossed it over, smiling as it broke at the base of the cage, releasing a thick blue vapor. James couldn&#39;t place the smell but it made him feel excited. He felt weak in the knees and dropped back on the cot inside the cage. Chris was still seated on the floor, but James could tell Mark was trying to be defiant and gripped the bars of the cage to stay upright.<br />
<br />
James&#39; cock quickly went to full mast, all nine inches of his cock was hard and flushed full of arousal. Though something felt, and looked, wrong. His cock was way too red and getting darker. The mushroom tip of his cock slowly reformed as if some invisible hand were playing with a shaft of clay, soon turning into a pointed tip as the base became thicker, until it bulged out near the bottom. Skin was forming around the base of his cock, too, pulling it up against his stomach so it pointed up towards his face, though at the moment it was all bunched between that bulbous pair of lumps at the bottom. Blond hair, no, it looked more like fur sprouted from the newly grown sheath and also spread down over his balls which felt fuller and heavier than they ever did before. He had a dog cock, a huge dog cock.<br />
<br />
He looked over at his friends and saw them both looking down at themselves in horror. All three of them were sporting canine erections now, Mark&#39;s black furred, and Chris&#39; brown. Chris was leaning back as if trying to put as much space between himself and his cock as possible. Mark&#39;s scowl only deepened. James started moving his hand towards his own cock but a sharp command of, &quot;No touching!&quot; from the archmage had his hand fly away and not of his own will. &quot;We&#39;ll need all that pent up energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two first.&quot; The archmage pointed to Mark and Chris, &quot;You wait right there.&quot; With a glance to James. He flicked his hand and the door to the cage swung open. He pointed to two spots on the floor in front of him. &quot;Stand there.&quot; James watched as his two friends strode out of the cage, standing right where the mage told them. He knew they weren&#39;t acting entirely with their own wills, but still it was strange to see them walk so calmly. It&#39;s didn&#39;t match their faces though, one pure fear the other rage. He held up to vials, a red one towards Mark and a green one towards Chris, giving only the sharp command, &quot;Drink.&quot; James could see them trying to resist, but soon both had drunk their vials.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, fuck.&quot; The archmage sat down on a couch by the window. &quot;You top, take him from behind.&quot; He pointed to Mark. &quot;And don&#39;t break anything.&quot; The archmage met James&#39; eyes with a smile. &quot;Enjoy the show, you&#39;ll join in soon enough.&quot; But James was too shocked to really think more that a few stray thoughts, and much to his horror there was some excitement in there.<br />
<br />
Mark and Chris were kissing, not slow passionate kissing, but greedy and hungry, their cocks pressed up against each other. For the first time in hours Chris didn&#39;t look scared, he looked eager. He rubbed at Mark&#39;s pecs as Mark squeezed his plump ass, backing them both up towards a sturdy looking table stacked with books. Mark roughly turned Chris around and bent him over the table. Chris&#39; tongue lolled out of his mouth, and when Mark grinned he had an obvious set of fangs. Mark leaned down and started eating out Chris&#39; hole, lubing it up with his own saliva, as he did James noticed both of them subtly changing, their ears shifting to points, moving up the sides of their heads. James felt at his own still human ears with a flush of relief, relief he felt guilty about.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with his tongue work, Mark lined his cock up with Chris&#39; ass and plunged almost all the way into him in one thrust, leaving the bulging knot outside of him for now. Mark only had four inches to work with but he made the most of it. Chris looked to be in exstacy, gripping the edge of the table as he looked back over his shoulder at Mark. Mark kept having to adjust his stand as his legs, and only his legs were changing. His feet stretching out until he stood on tip toe, but those tip toes were quickly forming into full canine paws. In fact James had a hard time seeing Chris&#39; feet at all. Then he noticed with a shock, it was because they were missing, from the knee down Chris&#39; and Mark&#39;s legs were merged. And the melding was slowly moving up the legs, making Mark&#39;s legs thicker as they absorbed Chris&#39;. But as it moved up Mark found himself able to thrust less and less, but with a howl he drove his knot into Chris, causing an echo of a howl to come from him as they both orgasmed. Chris&#39; seed spilling on the floor under the table as Mark&#39;s filled Chris.<br />
<br />
Now their thighs were pulling together. It wasn&#39;t Chris&#39; chubbiness being added to Mark&#39;s muscles, in fact, pulling Chris into him only seemed to be making the muscles swell. But not so much as would account for Chris&#39; full weight. &quot;Energy.&quot; The word pulled James out of his thoughts and looked over to the mage who spoke the word. &quot;It takes a lot of energy to merge two beings, and most of his physical form his being used for that, the remainder it being used to bulk up your friend. I&#39;m glad he has a lot to work with, more of you will have to go to the merger you&#39;re so thin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark and Chris were now one being from the waist down, and neither seemed to notice, or else they didn&#39;t care. Chris still gripped the table and Mark laid on top of him, nibbling at his neck and ears playfully. Those legs of theirs though were fully canine, black fur from the knees down with brown fur on the thighs and their now shared cock, which had been Chris&#39;. It looked bigger though, both longer and thicker, but still not quite matching up to the rigid pillar that James&#39; was still showing off.  Though it looked like their balls added to each other.<br />
<br />
Chris finally let go of the table and Mark stood up straight, they both did. The fusion was now up to their stomachs, and Chris seemed to be sinking into Mark. At first it looked like they had Chris&#39; gut, then their stomach quickly hardened into rigid abs even more cut and defined than Mark&#39;s had been, though the hair from Chris&#39; belly was left covering those abs. James had been expecting fur, but it was human body hair. The same hair that covered their merged chest as Chris&#39; soft chest became a pair of hardened round pectorals.<br />
<br />
Oddly, their arms weren&#39;t fusing, nor were their heads. Both of their heads now sat side by side on their shoulders. Their upper set of shoulders, as their pectorals seemed to split from two to four, right down to another pair of nipples among the curly brown chest hair.  Chris and Mark started rubbing at their own chest, feeling the muscles and tweaking the new set of nipples, still lost in their own world as if they were feeling the most exhilarating post orgasm high of their lives.<br />
<br />
The two sets of arms they sported were now starting to change, growing similar. Mark&#39;s muscular arms only bulked up a little bit, but Chris&#39; lost the slight flab and swelled with newly cut muscle and definition. Soon, it was impossible to tell which pair had belonged to which head. Even Chris&#39; features were hardening a little, losing the rounded cherub look as extra chub melted away. Other than the pointed ears and fangs, their heads still looked mostly human. Slowly the ecstasy seemed to die away as they returned to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; The mage was now leaning forward in his seat, watching the merged pair.<br />
<br />
Mark said, &quot;Powerful,&quot; right as Chris said &quot;Incomplete,&quot; the two talking over each other.<br />
<br />
The mage simply nodded as if this was the answer he expected. He stood and motioned for James to come out of the cage. Almost as if his body were in control and not his mind, James stood up and stepped out of the cage, walking over to stand next to his friends.. friend? &quot;You can ask them.&quot; The mage said with a smile to James. &quot;I can hear the question in your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you both still in there?&quot; James looked his friends up and down, from their two heads right down to their single set of canine-like legs with their still throbbing erection.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both here but..&quot; The speaking went from the Mark head to the Chris one, &quot;We&#39;re not separate. We&#39;re closer than ever before and it feels wonderful. You shouldn&#39;t fight it, join us. We&#39;ll be closer than brothers, we&#39;ll be together.&quot; Mark/Chris kept switching which head was speaking, but it was obvious it was one line of thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I have much choice.&quot; James said, and he wasn&#39;t sure if he was sad about that, or eager.<br />
<br />
&quot;Their minds are about ninety percent merged.&quot; The mage said. &quot;As will yours be. Enough that you may still have some separate thoughts and personality quirks, but enough that your brains won&#39;t have a seizure from conflicting input or from fighting for control. That happened in one of my test runs.&quot; He tsked under his breath as he picked up a yellow vial and held it out to James, along with a purple one towards the merged Mark/Chris. Both drank without a word. Chris&#39; head drinking while Mark looked at James gleefully, expectantly.<br />
<br />
The mage just waved for them to proceed as he retook his seat. Their cock was already slick with pre from their previous fuck, and was drooling out even more now, so the merged Mark/Chris wasted no time in wrapping their arms around James. Jame was no longer taller than both his friends, they probably had a good six inches on him now, and skinny as he was, he found it no surprise to suddenly be manhandled by two sets of arms. One set gripping his thighs and the other his waist, lifting him into the air.  James felt the tip of that canine cock against his hole and braced himself as he was plunged down onto it. His own hands gripped tightly at his friends&#39; upper set of arms.<br />
<br />
There was some pain, but mostly it felt amazing. What he didn&#39;t expect was the almost immediate feeling of thought at the back of his mind. Not his thought, but someone else&#39;s. There was a slight echo to it, as if it wasn&#39;t completely one thought, but it filled him with a feeling of belonging. It felt almost as wonderful as the feeling of being filled, his anal virginity being taken by his two best friends at once. He lost himself in the feeling of being overpowered and taken, his cock twitching excitedly with each thrust into him, until the resistance started, as if the skin to skin contact between him and his friends was growing more permanent. He felt his ass part on his friends&#39; thick knot, the feeling causing him to throw back his head and let out a howl, thick ropes of cum spurting from his cock as he felt warmth flooding him, two howls joining his.<br />
<br />
Orgasm ebbing, James opened his eyes and looked down. From the waist down there was now nothing of him left other than the blond furred sheath holding his large canine cock. Though it had swelled from nine inches to near eleven, his heavy ball sack hanging a third of the way down his thighs which were now blond furred on the inside, brown on the outside, and darkening to black on his feet. He felt something whipping back and forth behind him, a tail that had grown suddenly during their orgasm. And he knew all three of them could feel it, just as he could now feel those shared legs, and could no longer feel a cock buried inside of him.<br />
<br />
James grimaced as he felt a sudden pain in his skull. His arm, still free and under his control moved towards his face. His mouth and nose were pushing outwards into a distinct muzzle. The pain was only momentary, as was the feeling of fur sprouting over his face. He turned his head, first one way than the other, seeing two distinctly canine faces behind him, erect ears coming to floppy points, muzzles filled with sharp teeth and long tongues. Identical except for color. The head that was once Mark was furred black, and Chris brown. James new almost instinctively he was sporting golden blond fur himself. Tri-colored mane grew down his back and in a small crest in the center of his top set of pectorals, their three canine heads still set on a mostly normal human torso, other than the four human arms and four pectorals.<br />
<br />
His torso continued to be pulled into his friends&#39;. Adding a little bit more muscle to their already heavily muscled body, but not as much as the merger between Chris and Mark had done. Nor did his arms remain free, instead as they sunk into their shared body he began to feel the other four arms, awareness of them coming to life in his head. The faint glimmer of thought in the back of his mind came roaring forward as he head took up position between the other two. He felt his friends in that rush, even as it swirled together with his own mind. Though instead of being overtaken by it, his mind took them in. He was the core of their shared thoughts now. He could pluck and pull at images and memories from all three of them, and knew what came from who, but he was chief. But he also wasn&#39;t alone, they were a part of him as much as his legs or arms were.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; The words came from the mage in his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Complete. Wonderful.&quot; Each head spoke one word, but the thoughts were indistinguishable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, the king will be impressed.&quot; The mage stepped forward, admiring his handiwork, circling the merged friends with a smile. &quot;Everything seems to have worked perfectly. Complete fusion of three beings into one, the perfect guard for the king. I got the idea from the old human myth of Cerberus. One head can sleep while the other two remain on watch. Three minds to process everything, your reaction times should be amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that our name now? Cerberus?&quot; The heads still swapped speech from one to the next, though not breaking the line of thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want it to be?&quot; The mage asked, the three heads looked at each other then all shook no in unison. It really was hard to tell if they were three entities or one. &quot;Well, I always thought I would like to have a son named Stone. Does that suit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we your son?&quot; The middle head asked with a curious tilt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you may be, I&#39;m not sure I will ever outdo myself, and I must admit I feel a certain sense of pride.&quot; The mage came to a stop in front of his creation.<br />
<br />
Somewhere, deep down was memory of anger and fear at this man, his placid rabbit face. But now they felt whole in a way they never would have without this mage. And in a three part thought, all of them were in a way thankful. &quot;Then we accept, we will be your son, Stone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, get some sleep.&quot; The archmage motioned to a large bed off to the side of the workroom, not the cot in the cage. Nor did Stone feel the compulsion to do so that they had felt before. But they were suddenly very exhausted, and sleep sounded like the perfect thing.</p>
