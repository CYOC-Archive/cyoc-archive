<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You follow Sarah down a dark hall and eventually through four doors. Once you're past the fourth door you see sunshine through another door at the top of some stairs. You hesitate upon seeing it, fearful of what will happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Sarah asks you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Won't we die if we're exposed to sunlight?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all&quot; Sarah says, &quot;sunlight doesn't kill us. All it does is rob us of our ability to transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we die?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is only one way for us to die&quot; Sarah says, &quot;and that is for us to starve. It takes three months for that to happen though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it painful?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I imagine that it is&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't sound like something I want to experience&quot; you say as you resume walking.<br />
<br />
You emerge into a sunlight filled hall and continue down another hall. After a sort bit you arrive in a huge hall filled with tables. There is a guy behind a counter and he looks up as you enter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Sal&quot; Sarah says to the guy as you come up to the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Sarah&quot; Sal says and then looks at you. &quot;Now who might you be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my daughter Violet&quot; Sarah said putting a hand on your shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard you had sired a new vampire&quot; Sal said. &quot;You must be feeling a strange hunger/thirst about now. Is that why you're here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is Sal&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, what will you have?&quot; Sal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll take an A negative and give Violet an O positive&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming right up&quot; Sal said. He put two glasses under a couple of spigots and filled them up with a red liquid that you guessed was blood. &quot;Here you are&quot; he said placing the glasses on the counter, &quot;one A negative and one O positive. Will there be anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now Sal&quot; Sarah said as she took the glasses.<br />
<br />
Sarah leads you to a table and sits down. She hands you one of the glasses and says &quot;This one is yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you tell?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you've had each blood type you'll be able to tell by the smell&quot; Sarah said. &quot;You should be able to smell the blood by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You notice that you can smell something that you haven't smelled before. &quot;I think that I can&quot; you say. &quot;So I have to drink the blood right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You drink it through your fangs&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Your fangs are hidden in special sheaths. You should be able to feel some new muscles above the roof of your mouth. Flex those and your fangs will slide out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the claws of a cat&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is like that&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
You find that you could easily flex those new muscles and you extend<br />
your fangs. You were about to ask Sarah a question but you think that your fangs might make it difficult to talk so you retract them.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I drink through my fangs?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that you retracted your fangs before speaking&quot; Sarah said. &quot;That's good as at first it is difficult to talk with your fangs out. Now to answer your question, just put your fangs in the glass and suck through them. It's a basic instinct and you'll be able to easily drink the blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
You extend your fangs again and put them in the glass like Sarah said. You then think about sucking the blood through your fangs and you feel a different set of muscles contract and relax drawing the blood up through your fangs. As you drink you feel that weird thirst slake. When you were about halfway done with it someone came and sat at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Blade&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Sarah&quot; Blade said, &quot;I need your help. There's been a rash of killings lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard about that&quot; Sarah said, &quot;but I'm unable to help you. I just sired a new vampire so I have my hands full for the next couple of days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This must be the vampire you sired&quot; Blade said. &quot;If I may ask, what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Violet&quot; you say after you retract your fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Violet&quot; Blade said extending his hand. &quot;My true name is Daniel but please call me Blade.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake Blade's hand and then Sarah says &quot;Blade is a vampire hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A vampire hunter!&quot; you say shocked and a bit afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry&quot; Blade said, &quot;I'm not here to hunt your clan. I know that your clan doesn't kill anyone when hunting. I was hoping that Sarah would be able to help me find out if these recent murders were committed by some other vampire in a different clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think these murders were committed by a vampire?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A contact I have in the police department has told me that the corpses were drained of blood&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't heard that from our contact&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that your contact has been kept out of the loop on this one&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Blade said. &quot;I suspect that they have their suspicions that she's leaking information to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we're not getting the info that we need&quot; Sarah said. &quot;This is disturbing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not the half of it&quot; Blade said. &quot;From what my contact said it looks like someone is trying to set your clan up for these murders. If enough vampire hunters believe that, you'll have a mess on your hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's why you wanted my help&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother is the best partner a vampire hunter could have&quot; Blade said. &quot;Is there any way you could help me Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry but I need to train Violet even more now&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I'll also have to put in a motion to temporarily stop members from siring any more vampires. This is going to be a long day.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment a woman came up to Sarah and said &quot;I'm sorry to disturb you Sarah but I have urgent news you need to hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Anna?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We just found Harry staked&quot; Anna said. &quot;There was a note pinned to his chest. It said 'We vampire hunters have ignored your clan long enough. These recent murders are proof that you are not the type of vampires you claim to be. You are in fact blood sucking fiends who care nothing about human life. This is to let you know that you will be destroyed. This is not a threat, this is a promise.' The note wasn't signed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is Harry doing?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's doing ok&quot; Anna said. &quot;He was only staked for a couple of hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Do the other council members know about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they do&quot; Anna said. &quot;They have requested that you join them to discuss a moratorium on siring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already thought about that&quot; Sarah said. &quot;I'll join the council in just a little bit. I have to take Violet back to her room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll inform the council&quot; Anna said. She bowed and left.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's only one that I can think of that would right that note&quot; Blade said. &quot;It had to be Alucard. He's always looking for an excuse to wipe out all vampires. Just because he claims to be descended from Vlad Dracul and thinks it's his destiny to rid the world of vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have proof yet that Alucard wrote that note&quot; Sarah said, &quot;though it probably was him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be a little confused seeing as you were just turned Violet&quot; Blade said. &quot;The vampire hunter Alucard claims that he is descended from Vlad Dracul who is better known as...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dracula&quot; you say interrupting Blade.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that?&quot; Blade asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was interested in vampires before I was turned&quot; you say. &quot;I had read up on the legend of Dracula and who he was suppose to be. Besides, Alucard is Dracula spelled backwards. A good name choice for someone claiming to be descended from Vlad Dracul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I guess you know the methods Alucard will use to try to kill you&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm aware of the various methods to dispose of a vampire&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Name them&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the most popular one is driving a wooden stake through the vampires heart&quot; you say. &quot;Then there is holy water, cutting off the head and stuffing garlic in it's mouth, staking a vampire with silver, setting the vampire on fire, exposing the vampire to sunlight, dismembering the vampire and burying it at a crossroads, and if it's a foreign vampire then destroying the dirt from it's native land will force it to either flee back to it's native land or die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you destroy the dirt from a foreign vampires native land?&quot; Blade asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are several ways&quot; you say. &quot;The most effective way is to scatter the dirt on the ground. Another way is to put a holy wafer in with the dirt or put silver on the dirt if it's in a coffin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do know they various ways to destroy a vampire&quot; Blade said. &quot;Most new vampires only know about the wooden stake through the heart, holy water, and sunlight. Thanks to the Blade movies people are beginning to realize about the silver and fire methods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That reminds me&quot; you say. &quot;Why did you take the name Blade?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I like to use a blades made from silver&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Violet&quot; Sarah says to you, &quot;enough talk. Finish your blood so I can take you back to your room. That's the safest place for you right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Sarah&quot; you say and you start drinking your blood again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What evidence is there that points to us?&quot; Sarah asked Blade.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like there was a survivor of one of the attacks&quot; Blade said. &quot;She played dead as the attacker bit her friend's neck and drained her blood. Her description of the attacker fits Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So Alucard picks Harry to stake because of the description of the attacker that was given by this supposed survivor&quot; you say forgetting to retract your fangs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems like it&quot; Sarah said. &quot;By the way, did you notice that you spoke with your fangs extended?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot to retract them&quot; you say with your fangs still extended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most new vampires in your clan take a month or two to learn how to speak with their fangs out&quot; Blade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've seen a few who were able to learn in a week or two but, you're the first that I've seen or heard of that learned to speak with their fangs out on the first day as a vampire&quot; Sarah said. &quot;It may not take two days to teach you how to mist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It may have something to do with the fact that I had dressed up as a vampire most Halloweens&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;There have been others that did that too and they weren't able speak with their fangs out on the first day&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She seems to be quite talented&quot; Blade said. &quot;You made a good choice for a daughter Sarah. With what I've seen so far, I'd be honored to have you at my side along with your mother Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be an honor for me&quot; you say. &quot;I just remembered another way to deal with a certain type of vampire. This vampire is exclusively female I believe and it has a hole in the back of the neck. It's said that if you cut the vampire's finger nails and stuff them in that hole, it would cure her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't heard of that one&quot; Blade said. &quot;It would be wonderful if we could cure all vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe but then you'd be out of a job&quot; Sarah said. Seeing that you had finished your blood she said &quot;I'm sorry Blade but we have to go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; Blade said. &quot;It was an honor meeting you Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here Blade&quot; you say shaking his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before you go I would like to know something if I may&quot; Blade said. &quot;What gender and age were you before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was male and 34&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Sarah leads you back to your room and takes you inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be back in a bit to teach you how to mist&quot; Sarah said. &quot;There is a bathroom through those curtains there and there is writing materials in the desk if you want to write. I must insist that you remain here. Don't go with anyone that might come in. Don't invite anyone in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to ask you something Sarah&quot; you say. &quot;You've told me before that you were 33. How old are you really and were you a male before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was turned on my 33rd birthday by my father two hundred years ago&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that make your actual age 233?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being turned is like being born so I'm two hundred years old&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand that now&quot; you say. &quot;Do you celebrate your birthday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now I need to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah hugged you and kissed your forehead then turned to mist and left.</p>
