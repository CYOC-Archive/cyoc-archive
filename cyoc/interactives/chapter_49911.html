<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaylee asked, &quot;These will be the last ones won't they? Besides Fran's immediate family, <br />
your school friends will be the last ones won't they? The old man we're turning into a pet <br />
and into a bodyguard for the pups, so your friends will be the last ones we'll be adding to <br />
the pack won't they?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen thought for a moment and nodded, &quot;Yes... Bart still has his Wolvesdale fantasy, but <br />
that's all it is, a fantasy.&quot; That was when finally a thought to the future hit Jensen. Being <br />
Jennifer she hadn't really though beyond high school or even what collage she'd be <br />
applying for. So thinking of the future wasn't something he was used to at all, but finally <br />
something did flicker in his big bad black furry head, &quot;If Bart wants to try and take over <br />
Glendale with the game and possibly destroy the pack in the process after I'm big, old and <br />
gray and on the way out that's his business. But for now, thirty-eight total with my friends <br />
and Fran's family will be more than enough.&quot; It was clearly uncomfortable for Jensen to <br />
even speak of himself being old, as Jennifer the idea had been just plain alien. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe since the Big Bad Wolf is fictional, a story, and you are now the Big Bad Wolf and <br />
we are your pack we will never age since stories are timeless?&quot; Kaylee suggested to better <br />
her Master's ever so slightly negative mood. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.&quot; <br />
<br />
As usually Kaylee was slightly torn in there being one less female wolf who would distract <br />
Jensen from her, but on the other she didn't want her Master's selection of females <br />
decreased by one iota, but her Master had said they would use this new male to nip Nick's <br />
idea of a power structure in the bud (in spite of it being perfectly wolf nature TO have a <br />
power structure), and so for the greater cause she would go along with as her master <br />
wanted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that we'll be adding to our numbers after that the old fashioned way?&quot; Kaylee <br />
looked happy about this part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Jensen nodded rubbing one of Kaylee's maternal material. <br />
<br />
The twins would make note of this later, that Bart's safety measure of having some males <br />
around to service the seventeen lesser females, and Jensen's new design to have one more <br />
to keep them in check: they had effectively insured that the pack would have a future even <br />
if Master was ever lost. The idea of Master's end was incomprehensible of course, but all <br />
the same was the new ratio within the pack had guaranteed for the short term at the very <br />
least the pack's genetic future. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me aunite,&quot; Alice turned around to faced the twins, &quot;But where is your old house?&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins echoed sighs. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the mirror a minute later, Alice wondered. <br />
<br />
Why didn't  auntie want Alice's cousins to join the pack as glass wolves like Alice was. Her <br />
mother and auntie were twins in all things, so Alice would logically at one point have to <br />
find herself a sister and her cousins would become glass wolves like Alice... <br />
Were mother and auntie ashamed of Alice? <br />
<br />
Alice shivered at the thought, the game had made her Darla and the Master's child, <br />
though she had only existed since that morning... While Alice couldn't deny what she felt <br />
for her new mother, she wondered for a moment if her mother felt the same. <br />
<br />
Still, her mother and auntie had said very much -not- to bring any of auntie's former <br />
family into the mirror world to become like her so Alice would obey her mother... she only <br />
hoped they changed their mind later.<br />
<br />
Alice took three steps in the empty world that she was the only resident of. &quot;One, two, <br />
three.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Here are the shipping boxes ya'all ordered.&quot; Said the man from the delivery service truck <br />
after one of the shadows had phoned in the request for some free shipping boxes (which <br />
shipping the company was actually rather eager to provide). <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Margot said the red-violet she-wolf as she signed for the empty flat <br />
packages the pack would be needing to sell off the junk they no longer had use or need <br />
for. She noticed him starring at her chest but said nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know miss I wouldn't all if ah got ta know dat body I mean you a bit better.&quot; <br />
<br />
Margot knew precisely how to give him a body like hers for him to know what to do with... <br />
however there was a chance he'd just chose transform and they'd be left with a truck <br />
outside the gate with no reason for being there. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I'm rather committed right now.&quot; Margot said handing the clipboard back to him as <br />
she lifted the two piles of massive cardboard boxes with minimal effort. The truck driver <br />
only left after she had gone inside the swinging of her tail having him effectively <br />
hypnotized until she entered the estate and the delivery man returned to his rout. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You there, Nicole.&quot; Kaylee said to a gray furred wolf carrying the last piece of humanish <br />
art the pack no longer found easy on the eyes. <br />
<br />
She stopped dead in her tracks, put down the bronze statue and bowed, &quot;Actually it's <br />
Alexandra Alpha Female.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Oh right, no ribbon,' Kaylee thought, 'All the wolves were supposed to be uniquely <br />
colored, Nick is dark gray, June is a gray silver pattern, but Nicole and this she-wolf are <br />
the same shade of gray like Roger and Megan are the same shade of green. Is Alexandra <br />
related to Nicole? I'll have to ask that later.'    &quot;Alexandra, do you still have your turn? <br />
Master's old school friends will be arriving this evening under the pretense of a sleep over <br />
to be the penultimate additions to the pack via the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I suggest Ulysses Alpha Female?&quot; Alexandra said not ceasing her bow, &quot;All the other <br />
males' turns were used to convert the other groups and he would be a good way to round <br />
things out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee thought about that making sense, however, &quot;The master said he desired a she-wolf <br />
that still had her turn at the game, do you still have your turn?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do Alpha Female, only Maxine has used her turn when she brought Millie into our pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Oh right the late comer.' &quot;As soon as you're done with your task you're to report to the <br />
Master's new bed room for instructions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; Alexandra finally ceased her bow and took the bronze statue and <br />
carried into the room where Lawrence and Ulysses were waiting. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we -have- to do this?&quot; Nick asked. The game had precisely said he would revel in any <br />
task given to him by the females of the pack, but he reveled in some tasks more than <br />
others.<br />
<br />
Nicole looked at him, &quot;There are NEVER EVER going to be equal or greater number of <br />
males to females in the pack, so a normal sized room is good enough for the pack male's <br />
den. But a common den for us and the Alphas will need to be larger. We asked Caroline <br />
remember that these two rooms would do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We converted three rooms onto the single den for the she-wolves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Master can use the she-wolves den if he ever wants all of us at once... now let's get <br />
started!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One two, one two, pow-pow-pow!&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
the blue green she wolf looked at the teal wolf as they carried out the smashed remains of <br />
the former walls, &quot;You hear that?&quot; Terri asked Sandi to the sounds of what could have <br />
been a series of sledge hammers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do! You know what that means!&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri nodded, &quot;Yes it means we have -another- pile of sheet rock, wood and insulation to <br />
take care off after this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least we're not going to have any trouble sleeping tonight...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Abbey and Samantha were long home from Kindergarten and the afternoon cartoons had <br />
ended (their parents didn't have cable, and it was doubtful that that Julie would have let <br />
them watch cartoon network since it's demographic shift).  Leaving two five year olds <br />
home alone was the last sane thing any mother would do, and Julie was on the phone still <br />
making futile calls to the FBI who kept giving her the run away, inspiring her to go to her <br />
computer to dig up references on FBI policy and calling them again.  The fraternal had <br />
figured out that they were NOT to bother their mother while she was like this. <br />
<br />
In their bed room the girls were engaged in a calm tea party with their stuffed animals. <br />
They were remotely curious to where their father was but figured he was doing something <br />
very important and everything was going to be alright. <br />
<br />
They offered some more tea to their brown and yellow rabbit who happily accepted it, but <br />
the blue and yellow frog would have none, which was very rude of it indeed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; The girls turned to their open closet door and saw in the door's mirror was a <br />
yellow colored wolf wearing a blue and white dress like in one of their picture books, she <br />
was standing on two legs and had long blond hair. The wolf curtsied and said, &quot;How are <br />
you?&quot; <br />
<br />
The girls never having seen a wolf in their mirror before inched a ways a bit, Samantha <br />
back (older by three minutes) and Abbey foreword (younger by three minutes).  &quot;I'm fine.&quot; <br />
Samantha replied.   <br />
<br />
&quot;We're having a tea party, who are you?&quot; Abbey asked curiously. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Alice,&quot; <br />
<br />
Samantha gasped, &quot;As in Alice in Wonderland?&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice tilted her head, &quot;Sort of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha asked, &quot;Is this like that Little Mermaid cartoon where the author goes <br />
underwater in a submarine and meets Ariel and is inspired to write a book about her?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I never saw that.&quot; Alice said, the blond wolf looked at them both, &quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Five.&quot; &quot;Five.&quot; The girls held up their hands for added impact. &quot;How old are you?&quot; Abbey <br />
asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am seven and a half.&quot; Alice said, there was a sound of slight disappointment at their <br />
differences in age. &quot;Are you Abbey and Samantha?&quot; Alice asked remembering the names <br />
Alice had been given when Auntie had given her directions. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Abbey Butler!&quot; Said the blond girl pointing at her chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Samantha Butler!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It is nice to meet you.&quot; Alice said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not gonna eat us up are you like the big bad wolf?&quot; Samantha asked. <br />
<br />
Alice shook her head, not saying anything on that subject, after all, her father's reputation <br />
was fully deserved, &quot;No I'm not, I'm just here to give you a message.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From the queen of hearts?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;From little red riding hood?&quot;  Samantha wondered out loud. <br />
<br />
Alice shook her head again, &quot;Nope!  The message is, 'that your daddy is safe and sound <br />
and looks foreword to see you again soon.' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't know daddy was in trouble.&quot; Samantha said. <br />
<br />
Alice said smiling, &quot;He isn't in the least, he's perfectly fine, that's what the message said <br />
right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; Samantha answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where is your mama? I have a message for her too.&quot;  Alice asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;She's busy,&quot; Abbey said. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is quite important you see.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She's REALLY busy,&quot; Samatha added, &quot;She sounds unhappy, and she said to not bother <br />
mama when she was really busy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see, then it would not simply be proper then would it.&quot; Alice said, &quot;But I did promise <br />
to give her the message.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you can give it to us and we can give it to her?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
Alice thought about it, they were her cousins, (for less than twelve hours) she was sure <br />
could trust them. &quot;That seems perfectly reasonable. The message is, that your daddy loves <br />
your mama very much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;I'll remember.&quot; Abbey and Samantha said. <br />
<br />
&quot;So would you like to join us for tea?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I can only have tea in here.&quot; Alice apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then can we come in there with you?&quot; Abbey asked curious as to what was on the other <br />
side of the mirror. <br />
<br />
Alice looked said,  &quot;I would most certainly and greatly like that, but sadly I promised I <br />
would not. Maybe next time I see you you'll get to come inside and then I take you to your <br />
daddy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's not fair.&quot; Samantha said, &quot;We should be able to come in with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded, &quot;I will ask auntie and mama if I can next time I see you... but mama said to <br />
come right back home after I told you that your daddy was safe and that he loved your <br />
mama so I really need to go, maybe we can have tea in here next time I visit.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna go inside now!&quot; Abbey said. <br />
<br />
Alice sadly shook head, &quot;I want you to to, but promise are important and you should never <br />
break them. It was nice meeting the both of you, I hope we do get to know each other <br />
better soon.&quot;  Alice curtsied with her dress and walked out of frame. <br />
<br />
Abbey tapped and knocked the glass but it was utterly solid much to Abbey's <br />
disappointment. <br />
<br />
The girls tried to pass along Alice's message twice and both times were shoed away both <br />
times telling their mother about Alice's visit (which she didn't have time for their <br />
pretending).  The girls finally decided they'd have to skip the part about Alice and just tell <br />
their mother the message. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy... daddy loves you very much.&quot; Abbey said putting on her best cute face.<br />
<br />
Julie stopped, looked at Abbey knelt down hugged her, &quot;I know sweetie, I know he loves <br />
me, and I know he loves you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls were very glade they got their message delivered for Alice. And waited eagerly <br />
for when she would appear again. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
The noise of construction was still going strong within the house as the sun set (as was <br />
the sound of panting tired wolves becoming more audible). Normally you don't let kids out <br />
after dark, but wolves had night vision which the cub managed to enjoy a little bit of night <br />
exploration, but Martha was quickly told to bring the children in and was able to do so <br />
with only a slight display of course. <br />
<br />
Isabelle was dropped off by her parents carry bags of junk food, two movies, and several <br />
board games.  Hope and Grace had walked together to the manor both only carrying duffle <br />
bags, while Zylphia had driven herself there with her suitcase in the back seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Need some help there 'Bell?&quot; Hope said with a smirk on her short trim sandy blond <br />
features. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've got it.&quot; Said the long haired full figured long haired platinum blond nearly tripping <br />
over herself and her junk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so.&quot; The black haired medium length Grace took one look at Isabelle and <br />
took off about half her burden. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Isabelle replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, like, this is, whao... check out these ugly characters.&quot; Zylphia pointed, the tallest girl <br />
in the group and single curly brunette. <br />
<br />
&quot;When did Jen's parents have -these- installed?&quot; Isabelle asked pointing at the nasty <br />
looking gargoyles surrounding the estate. <br />
<br />
&quot;When we weren't here obviously.&quot; Hope pointed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you guys hear something?&quot; Grace perky an ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like someone's building something... or tearing it down.&quot; Zylphia said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let's go see if Jennifer's been brainwashed by martians and is build them a space <br />
ship.&quot; Hope said without being the least bit serious in said theory. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, foreword troops.&quot; Zylphia led the way through the front gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonder what all the packages are for?&quot; Isabelle wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rich folks,&quot; Hope commented, &quot;They want something until they have it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zylphia took the lead, with Hope and Grace should to shoulder, and Isabelle bringing up <br />
the rear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you see something moving in the upstairs window?&quot; Grace asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; Hope asked wondering what the point was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looked like a furry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like Jennifer could EVER be into that!&quot; Hope pointed out, &quot;She thinks furries are the <br />
absolute most demented freaks in the cosmos! She doesn't even LIKE ANIMALS! Remember <br />
when you got her that pet cat and she tossed it back to the pet store without even taking <br />
the muzzle off? If it was a dog it would have broken a hip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace nodded and sighed, &quot;I remember.... She can be so closed minded at times. What's <br />
wrong with being a furry? It's not like they're out to mutate people or something.&quot;  They all <br />
looked at her.  &quot;Not that... I like that sort of thing of course...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not all bad.&quot; Isabelle defended, &quot;She's fun to have around as long as you don't <br />
mention animals, furries, mother nature, magic, mysticism or stuff like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Zyphia said, &quot;Let's just like find out if she's okay first okay? She made up that excuse <br />
about the phone so maybe she'll be willing to admit what's wrong face to face.&quot; <br />
<br />
The noise of construction seemed to die down as the four seniors got closer. They were <br />
curious about that. <br />
<br />
Finally, Zyphia opened the front door... <br />
<br />
Zyphia stared. Isabelle nearly fainted. Grace gasped. And Hope's mouth looked like a big <br />
round hole.<br />
<br />
The main foyer looked like it and the rest of the inside of the house was in the middle of <br />
being taken apart (or put back together again). Rolled down from the stairs was a red <br />
carpet that normally wasn't there with gold trim that you normally reserved for dignitaries. <br />
But that wasn't what got the girls attentions. <br />
<br />
Flanking either side of the red carpet. standing at attention with their feet together arms <br />
at their sides and their smiling faces facing the girls were wolf people. All of them were <br />
naked except one wearing a red ribbon around one ear. All of them were taller than even <br />
Zyphia. <br />
<br />
At the very beginning of the line on the right was a wolf woman creature thing that <br />
seemed to have two of almost everything with six eyes like a insect three on each head <br />
with it's tails flat on it's legs. Opposite the wolf-woman-creature-thing was a orange and <br />
white one with her tail raised slightly higher. <br />
<br />
These pairs continued on ten more times, all of them women except for one dark gray one <br />
near the very end who was clearly a guy opposite of a white furred strangely flat chested <br />
she-wolf.  Around eighty percent of them were colored colors that had no right to exist as <br />
a fur color but did reminds the girls of Isabelle and Zyphia's anime collections, as bright as <br />
ink and paint. There were also quite a few greens.  <br />
<br />
At the very end of the lines were two identical dirty blond ones that had chests that were <br />
relatively larger than any of the other she wolves there. But Grace thought at them, 'I've <br />
seen bigger.' <br />
<br />
On the stairs themselves were much small wolves, with the proportions of children. Two <br />
red-brown ones on the right and a a black and red-brown on the left. A glass sculpture of <br />
one sat down in the middle. At on the top of the stairs walked out, was the biggest and <br />
baddest wolf the girls had ever seen walking on two legs flanked on one side by shorter by <br />
two whole feel still impressive she wolf who only the twins surpassed in figure size. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome!&quot; Said the big wolf in a rough voice, &quot;Hope you guys had a pleasant trip over!&quot; <br />
<br />
Zylphia shouted,  &quot;WEREWOLVES!&quot; <br />
Isabelle screams, &quot;ALIENS!&quot;<br />
Hope said, &quot;WHAO!&quot;<br />
Grace stared in amazement, &quot;COOL!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Please... go ... inside...&quot; <br />
<br />
The girls slowly turned around to see the gargoyle from before (the only male one they had <br />
seen) now standing right behind them and pointing it talent towards the door way. <br />
<br />
Only Isabelle screamed this time. <br />
<br />
All of them inched inside. <br />
<br />
The orange one and creature-wolf closed the doors behind them 'for them.' <br />
<br />
As the girls stepped inside the wolf people hup to and switched so they were facing each <br />
other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zelph! Bell! Hope! Grace!&quot; The biggest beast wolf now with open arms as he slowly came <br />
down the steps on one side of the glass sculpture and the red-brown side wolf down the <br />
other. &quot;Great to see you could all make it!&quot; <br />
<br />
At an unseen signal eighties pop music began to play. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come along now... don't be shy...&quot; <br />
<br />
The girls took a step back, then remembered the stone monster outside and the other <br />
ones they had seen, began to step closer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Millie, Ulysses, take their bags.&quot; Said the red-brown she wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha female.&quot; Two of the wolf girls broke rank and took the girls' luggage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't sort and organization it until -after- they've gone through it themselves.&quot; The <br />
biggest one said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The two said together as the two wolves hurried off with the girls' property. <br />
<br />
Then the sculpture moved, -on it's own!- and spoke in a little girl's voice, &quot;Presenting! And <br />
display! And self-representing! Master Jensen, Alpha Male of the pack, and the one and <br />
only Big Bad Wolf! And his Alpha Female Kaylee!&quot; <br />
<br />
All the wolves except the twins and cubs clapped. <br />
<br />
Kaylee smiled as best as a wolf could, looking very pleased with herself and the reception <br />
the girls found themselves in. <br />
<br />
Jensen raised a hand and ended the clapping. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girls, sorry that the house is this way, we're in the middle of renovations... but I can <br />
promise we're gonna have the night of our lives!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Jenny!&quot;  Grace demanded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Which Jenny do you mean?&quot; Asked the sculpture, &quot;The Jenny you know, the Jenny who you <br />
spoke to, the Jenny you used to know, the 'Jenny' that is, or the Jenny that used to be?&quot; <br />
<br />
The twins look at it and the sculpture became quiet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, the Jenny whose our friend!&quot; Zylphia declared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right here.&quot; The Big Bad Wolf pointed at itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU ATE HER-?!&quot; Isabelle gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Jensen said in a flat tone, &quot;I did not, I am her... it's a very long story, and you all <br />
deserve to hear all of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm outta here!&quot; Hope turned to run and got back handed by a smiling pink wolf that <br />
floored her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! Sorry! You guys are stayin' and that's final!&quot; Jensen said putting his hands on his <br />
hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Jennifer.&quot; Grace sigh. <br />
<br />
Hope got up rubbing her face and a bit dizzy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now come along!&quot; Jensen said in a 'my way or the freeway' tone all the girls knew <br />
precisely well. <br />
<br />
As the girls got close all the wolves turned again so they were all looking at the girls' <br />
backs, and giving the girls a view of the she wolves tails. <br />
<br />
The girls took a few steps up the stairs, the pups moving to the sides for them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra, Darla, Fran, Pearl, with us,&quot; Kaylee said, &quot;The rest of you, back to work!&quot; <br />
<br />
Pearl followed thinking, 'I think she keeps picking me cause she remembers my name the <br />
easiest.'</p>
