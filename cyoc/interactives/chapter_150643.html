<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Surprisingly to her clients came quite early in the morning, Selicia stretched sitting up on her bed while Marina waited at the door. She stood up letting the blanket fall from her body revealing every inch to Marina. Marina blinked, blushed, and turned away as she realized what see was seeing. With a yawn, Selicia gave Marina her first order of the day. &quot;Marina, be a dear and bring my red dress from the closet would you? Oh, and if I didn&#39;t care for you to see, you wouldn&#39;t be standing there.&quot; Her dress was in her hand and slipped on quickly as Selicia reveled in Marina&#39;s embarrassment. &quot;Dear, you must get over that shyness around me, it won&#39;t serve you so well.&quot; She placed a hand on Marina&#39;s head as she walked by toward her bedroom door.<br />
<br />
When she arrived at the waiting room two woman dressed in leather, torn clothes, and tattoos than she&#39;d seen since her older days so long ago. Selicia was surprised by their civil names in comparison to their garb. They sat together on one couch to her right as she made to be seated in her chair. Belle had been first to introduce herself with Victoria being nudged into giving hers while she stared at the previous night&#39;s wishes. Victoria looked pleadingly at Belle afterward who shook her head and gestured to Selicia. After a second more pouting look, Belle sighed and looked to Selicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;She wants to know if she can touch it.&quot; Belle groaned as she waved her hand to her latest centerpiece.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead.&quot; Selicia responded in a mocking gesture of the wave Belle had used. While the Victoria hopped up from her seat and Belle watched her closely, Selicia took a good look at the pair.<br />
<br />
Belle had spiked pink tipped hair over its natural blonde color, her breasts looked as a modest B cup, she even sported a lip piercing. A black leather jacket over a black band shirt was complimented by black jeans and heavy leather boots. The girl wore enough black as if she were trying to wear the night...<br />
<br />
Victoria&#39;s hair looked like she hadn&#39;t bothered to tame the auburn locks this morning, though her chest stuck out further than her friends likely at least C cups, she had 5 ear pierces unevenly balanced four to one ear. The stark contrast was that she wore a crimson t-shirt, black shorts, torn black stockings, and old red sneakers. She sat as tall as Belle and the two were maybe a little too skinny...<br />
<br />
As Selicia observed the pair, Victoria immediately pinched the large onahole&#39;s nipples with a mischievous little chuckle. A few more pinches were applied as she discovered the softness of the material. Belle hadn&#39;t reached fast enough to stop her as Victoria rubbed the exposed clit. &quot;So where&#39;d you get these crazy thing anyway?&quot; Her question was posed to Selicia even though she hadn&#39;t looked to regard her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say their handmade, Dear.&quot; Selicia lifted a leg crossing it over her other legs. It seemed Belle hadn&#39;t caught a glimpse under her dress for she stared just a bit too long. With a grin, Selicia regarded Belle first as she had her attention at the moment. &quot;So why have you come to me, especially at such an early hour?&quot; Truth be told, she was rather irritated having been awoken so early but, work had to be done. Selicia clasped her hands together as she waited for Belle&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Oh, so you make wishes come true, yeah?&quot; Belle finally said as she came to and smiled in response to Selicia&#39;s nod. &quot;Awesome, so like I want to make really good art... Huh... I mean, I wish I could make really good art. Is that right?&quot; Selicia nodded again being patient with the girl. Catching the inclination of Selicia&#39;s stare, Belle half shoved Victoria jarring her from her play with the Onahole.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh-oh, yeah. I just want to save a lot of money so... Umm... I wish I had the sickest tat ever... I mean tattoo... Does that...&quot; She cut off seeing Selicia nod again. &quot;Awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Selicia was quickly garnering a headache dealing with the two of them so she decided sooner was better than later. If she finished this now, she could go back to sleep with minimal consequence. &quot;Alright then, in order to complete your wish, I need you to strip for me.&quot; She stared into Victoria&#39;s eyes before she could turn back to the centerpiece. Leaning her head on her hand, Selicia watched and the girl pulled off her red top. An appreciative look came to Selicia&#39;s face when she saw that the girl hadn&#39;t worn a bra and with the fall of the shorts, she hadn&#39;t worn panties either as she slid her tights to her ankles. There was a labia ring down in her vagina, was this girl just getting them anywhere?<br />
<br />
By the time the shirt came off, Belle had watched on in shock before turning to Selicia. &quot;Hey, what the hell are you making her do?!&quot; She stood taking a single step toward Selicia as Victoria stood still awaiting her next command.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too now.&quot; Selicia regarded Belle before she could take another step. Much like her friend, she immediately complied dropping off her jacket and pulling off her shirt. She HAD worn underwear as she unhooked the red bra and let it drop to the pile while she undid her belt. The jeans fell as soon as the belt pulled free and slipped free her red panties. The two of them stood still wearing nothing but, the footwear and Victoria&#39;s stockings. Motioning her hand toward them, Belle leaned back against Victoria and slowly melted into her. As she sank into Victoria, her now thinned feet slipped free from her boots. Neither of them struggled against what was happening as only Belles hands and feet remained outside of the other&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Once there was nothing left of Belle, an image started to bleed forth on Victoria&#39;s stomach. At first, it was merely a black outlining slowly etching a vaguely human shape on her body. As it progressed it became clear what had happened to Belle. Colors filled in the girl&#39;s tattoos, hair, lips and nipples as she neared completion of her new state. Belle was leaned back on one elbow, her open mouth represented by Victoria&#39;s belly button. The interesting details were that her lip ring now stuck out as her friend&#39;s new navel piercing and her hand reached down one finger left unfinished past the first knuckle as it plunged into their now shared vagina. Selicia stood up to inspect her handiwork more closely, pleased with the result on this side, she made Victoria turn around to reveal the backside of Belle. Belle&#39;s hair could be seen in full on Victoria&#39;s back, her eyes closed as she perpetually moaned in silence, there were angel wings tattooed to her back and a devil tail that hung down into a curl on their shared left ass cheek.<br />
<br />
Nodding in approval, Selicia once more made Victoria turn for her, this time to face her. All but Belle&#39;s jacket had vanished from the floor by the time Victoria came to. She looked around as if something was missing then looked down at her body, the smile was large and immediate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fucking sick, you really are magical!&quot; She rubbed the tattooed breasts of her once friend with a childish giggle. <br />
<br />
As Victoria reached down to collect her clothes Selicia got a devious idea.  &quot;Don&#39;t you want to show off your brand new &quot;tat&quot;?&quot; She cast another suggestion over Victoria implanting the strong desire to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell yeah, I&#39;ve got to show everybody!&quot; She turned in order to leave and fell flat on her face as her tights caught before tearing through. &quot;Shit, whoops...&quot; She pushed herself up putting her ass and vagina in full presentation to Selicia who sat quietly trying not to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget the jacket though, wouldn&#39;t want you to catch cold.&quot; Selicia watched as she blinked stupidly for a moment. Then as if to prove it, she took two steps back and bent over presenting it all once again picking up the jacket. Slipping the jacket on so it just barely covered her nipples, Victoria thanked her again running out the door. Marina stood just outside the now opened door way watching with surprise as the near nude woman rushed past her. Shrugging, Selicia shook her head and stood from her chair. &quot;Young people these days... They&#39;re just so free-spirited...&quot; There was a devious grin as she erased the clothing left behind by Victoria and yawned once again. &quot;Now, if anymore clients come, tell them to wait or come back later, Sweetheart.&quot; Another pat on the head like the one earlier and Selicia was off to her room to continue her rest.</p>
