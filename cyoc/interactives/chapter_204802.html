<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jaden returns his attention to the manual, &#39;let&#39;s see what else there is,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I have so many ideas for sprays. It would be cool if I could telepathically communicate with fellow reptiles, and order them to do my bidding.&#39; The tiny Lizard becomes more and more excited, the more he thinks about how awesome it would feel to rule the world. Jaden feels so powerful, being so intelligent simply feels amazing, he knows that he can do anything, his tiny brain already filling up with ideas. The Lizard senses that the new found power causes him to corrupt, becoming evil, but instead of being afraid, he embraces it. For Jaden, this is now his life and he wants to make sure that I will stay that way, which would mean to find a way to have the effects of the sprays and potions to be permanent. Flipping through the manual, Jaden soon finds out that, if a spray is fully used on one single subject, the effects will become permanent. Since Jake had emptied the whole spray bottle with the talk and intelligence potion on Jaden and the liquid completely absorbed into the Lizard&#39;s body, Jaden knows that his situation now will be permanent, &#39;perfect,&#39; he thinks to himself. Jaden decides to keep this information a secret from Jake, but then again, Jake is still so young that Jaden is sure that the boy&#39;s curiosity will win every time, causing Jake to give Jaden more and more of a spray until the effects are permanent. “What if I drink the potion directly,” he asks himself, the Lizard flips through the manual, “drinking a potion directly causes the effects to start instantly and the “risk” of it becoming permanent will increase! Good to know.”<br />
<br />
Just as Jaden finishes reading through the manual, the door to Jake&#39;s room opens, “hey Jaden,” Jake says, closing the door behind him, “I am back, sorry that it took so long,” he adds as he walks up to his desk.<br />
<br />
Jaden turns to look at Jake, “no worries, Jake,” he says, “I just got done with the manual, I know everything important.”<br />
<br />
Jake smiles, “cool,” he says, “thank god you are so smart. I&#39;d be frustrated trying to understand all of those weird words.”<br />
<br />
Jaden chuckles, “I admit, the manual is written like some science brochure,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jake continues to smile, “so, what have you found out?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, a lot of neat stuff,” Jaden replies, “for one, if you use a spray completely on me, the result will become permanent.”<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes widen, “and I used the whole intelligence and talk spray on you,” he says, “this means... .”<br />
<br />
Jaden nods, giving Jake his Lizard grin, “that my intelligence and ability to talk like a human is permanent.”<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes sparkle, “so cool,” he says, “so, have you thought of a spray which we should try out next?”<br />
<br />
The lizard nods, “I thought about creating multiple sprays at once,” he says, “and not just one, we&#39;d create more then one of every spray, that way we would have a vast amount of different kinds of sprays.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, “sounds good,” he says, “this would mean, we would not have to recreate a spray every time we&#39;d need a certain spray. If we need a certain kind of spray, we&#39;d simply grab it from our collection.”<br />
<br />
Jaden nods, “correct,” he says, “after we created the sprays, we&#39;ll use the ones I need on me.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, “and make sure that the effects will stay permanent,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jaden nods, “yup,” he says, “oh, by the way, you would not need to spray me, if I drink the liquid directly, not only will the effect be instantly but the chance of it becoming permanent will increase.”<br />
<br />
“Woah,” Jake says, “so, which spray should we start on first?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d prefer to call them “potions” instead,” Jaden says, “and I&#39;d like to first create a potion which would allow me to telepathically communicate with fellow reptiles.”<br />
<br />
Jake looks at the vials containing the chemicals, “I don&#39;t see any one of the chemicals labeled telepathy,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Leave that to me,” Jaden says, “I&#39;ll tell you which chemicals to use.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jake says, “what else?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like to be able to climb walls and walk along ceilings,” the Lizard says, “I&#39;d also like to have my body be more human-like, but I also want to be still able to walk on all fours.”<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes widen, “woah... okay,” he says, “your ideas sound similar to the abilities of “The Lizard” in the Spider Man comics.”<br />
<br />
Jaden tilts his head, “really,” he asks, “may I see a picture?”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, he walks over to a shelve where he keeps his comics and grabs one, he opens a page and walks back to Jaden. “Here, this is the Lizard,” the boy says, “his real name is Dr. Curt Connors, he accidentally transformed himself into a giant human-like Lizard.”<br />
<br />
Jaden looks at the picture, “man, he looks bad ass,” he says, he then looks up at Jake, “why did he do that to himself?”<br />
<br />
“He lost one of his arms in an accident... I think,” Jake explains, “he tried to create a potion which would regrow his arm... instead he transformed into a monster.”<br />
<br />
Jaden shakes his head, “humans are so dumb,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Some of them,” Jake says, nodding, “I am not one of those dummies though,” he adds.<br />
<br />
Jaden looks at the boy, &#39;sure you are,&#39; he thinks to himself, “of course not. You are one smart boy,” he then says.<br />
<br />
Jake beams, “thanks Jaden,” he says, feeling proud and happy, no one had ever called him smart before.<br />
<br />
Jaden “smiles” up at Jake, “I was thinking,” he says, “after we create the Anthro potion and use it on me, I&#39;d look like a grown up human.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, “I&#39;d assume that too,” he says, “what are you thinking?”<br />
<br />
“I am thinking about to create a de-aging potion, which would make me at least as old as you or a little older.”<br />
<br />
Jake thinks, “having you as young as me would be cool,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jaden nods, “so, I guess that would be all,” he says, “shall we begin?”<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t have to ask me twice,” Jake says with a smile, sitting down on his chair.<br />
<br />
While Jake follows Jaden&#39;s directions, what kind of chemicals to use to create the wanted potions, Jake is unaware of Jaden&#39;s sick plans. Jaden becomes more and more giddy, the closer the potions get to completion. After two hours they had already created growth, de-aging, Anthro, climbing, shrinking, intelligence, talk and telepathy potions and their duplicates.<br />
<br />
Jaden and Jake stare at all of the vials with finished potions, “phew,” Jake says, “we sure created a bunch of potions.”<br />
<br />
Jaden nods, “we sure did,” he says, “before we use them however, I want you to create a special potion for me.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, what kind of potion will it be,” Jake asks curiously.<br />
<br />
Jaden “grins”, “oh, that&#39;s a secret,” he says, “but you&#39;ll see soon enough, I promise.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Jake simply says, he trusts his friend, besides that, the 8-year-old boy is just to happy to have such a cool friend like Jaden, that he&#39;d do anything for him.<br />
<br />
Jaden tells Jake what chemicals to mix, with a “smile” the Lizard watches as the human boy starts mixing the “special” potion. Unaware to Jake, the potion he is creating for Jaden is a pheromone altering potion. This potion will cause Jaden&#39;s pheromones to have an interesting affect on humans: he&#39;d be able to send humans into a trance-like state, causing humans to do what ever he commands. Jaden smirks mentally to himself as he looks up at Jake, &#39;Jake will be the first human to obey me,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;soon the rest of the world will follow!&#39;<br />
<br />
Once the potions are finished, Jake looks down at Jaden and asks, &quot;so, Jaden. Which potion would you want to use first?&quot;</p>
