<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole’s hunger led the boy to the fridge, the half-fox perching on two digitigrade fox feet as he began rifling throw the crisper drawers. That lush covering of fox fur decorating his canine hips felt like the old pajamas he had just had on but better! That sleek canine coat kept him warm far better than those rags did, but he felt naked and free at the same time, his fox fuzz tickling the inside of his thighs and just making him more and more horny with every step he took. He needed more fur – but he’d also need a full stomach to change more!<br />
<br />
Cole was far too short to reach very far into the fridge and the boy’s hand-paws made it extra difficult to slide open the drawers where he knew the good food was. His plump paw pads just couldn’t grasp the handles as well as finger could, the contents of the meat drawer were cruelly held just out of reach by the thin plastic fridge-box. He knew his family kept breakfast sausage and cheeses in there, there also had to be an extra stock of salami and prosciutto from a left-over charcuterie board that his parents didn’t finish over the holidays. Cole didn’t even like that sort of food, but it didn’t even matter to him now. The picky-eater’s sense of taste was already dampened by the ravenous instincts of a fox. He needed food and as much of it as he could get! A full belly would help fuel his change into an animal, and later – more food meant more more energy, sex, and fox cum!<br />
<br />
Desperate, the fox-boy resorted to latching onto the handle with his teeth, grinding his front teeth against the plastic handle as he tried to tug it open. At first, his mouth kept slipping, his chompers clanging off the hard plastic until…<br />
<br />
His teeth suddenly sharpened to canine points, piercing the crude plastic handle giving him enough of a grip to tug backwards with all his might. The drawer violently flung open, the entire box of meats and cheeses ripped from the fridge and clattering on the floor, spilling out all its contents.<br />
<br />
Cole instantly clattered on his fox-legs across the linoleum tiling towards his prize, positively drooling at the selection of food. His mom must have just went shopping yesterday because the drawer’s spoils were rife with extra helpings of sausage and bacon, plus a whole pack of hot dogs to add to the boy’s foxy feast!<br />
<br />
Cole fetched the family pet cat’s water bowl from the other side of the kitchen, dumping out the liquid inside and quickly stuffing it with the food he’d just won. Foxes were like dogs, and he was already half-fox, so using a dog-bowl as a dish seemed fitting to Cole. He stuffed it with all the Canadian bacon and sausage we could, garnishing it with whatever cheese he could pick up as he used his sharp new canine fangs to slice open the package of hotdogs. Finally, Cole got on all fours, saliva dribbling from his mouth as he eyed the feast in front of him. The human part of his mind wretched at the sight of all that raw meat, but his growing fox-half had the opposite opinion.<br />
<br />
An instant injection of dopamine leaked from the vulpine part of his mind as Cole stuffed his face into the bowl. He ate just like a dog would, ravenously slurping up each and every piece of food his lips could reach. At first chewing all the rubbery uncooked meat was hard, but soon the rest of his teeth joined his canines as they changed into sharp piercing spikes, perfectly for ripping through raw flesh. Cole’s eyes widened in delight as he could feel himself transforming again, the foxy fluff tickling around his waist starting to grow even more, swallowing his bland human skin in an ocean of warm vulpine fur. As the changes from his bottom half crept up, Cole didn’t once stop scarfing down his food. In fact, his mouth got wider and longer, extruding into a distinctly fox-like muzzle as it allowed him to fill his maw with even more meat. Cole was so excited to fuel his transforming body that he almost choked on swallowing an ambitious mouth full of food. In response, he felt his neck start to extend and grow wider, enabling his new ravenous feeding pattern to continue as he tore through the food in front of him.<br />
<br />
As his nascent muzzle rifled through the bowl like an animal, it grew a leather black nose on the tip, filling Cole’s nostrils with a thrilling cacophony of scents. Everything from the harsh-tasting raw-meat to the intense scent of his own sex struck him all at once, unlocking a vivid world of taste and smells. Cole’s eyes widened at the revelation, turning into an animal’s as orange and creamy white fur sprouted all across his cheeks. His eyes became nothing more than that of a fox’s, leaving nothing but the light-blue color of his irises as a memento to his previous life. As his lush vulpine coat erupted over his head, his blonde hair changed into a fiery orangey red as sensitive vulpine eats sprouted up from his old human ones.<br />
<br />
Cole let out a muffled whimper past that mouthful of food as his throat began to change, vocal cords straining and shifting away from human speech to the simple yips of a common fox. His esophagus expanded just enough to allow that hefty load of food to sink into his belly. Cole’s human mind screamed to him that he was full, but the boy just couldn’t stop. His belly began to distend just a little as white, creamy fur covered it like a blanket. The rest of his orange-fox coat blazed across his torso, connecting his neck scruff to the rest of his fuzz, leaving him covered from head to paw in the natural outfit he’d be wearing for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
He was so close to being a real fox! To run and folic and play just like an animal would! Cole couldn’t express why he hated his parents and running away until now - he hated them because they were human! They would never let him be a fox – and he needed to be one so bad it hurt. Just a week ago he would have said he’d want to grow up to be something like an astronaut of a firefighter, but now… he didn’t want any of that. He just wanted to fuck and be fucked and make lots of kit batter! Nothing matter to him anymore… he just needed more-<br />
<br />
“Mrff-“ Cole coughed up his food a little, letting it slide into the food bowl as he felt his balls strain and tremble. His red rocket was on dull display, slapping heavily against his plump belly as gooey pre-jizz leaked from his swollen, sensitive cock tip. The changes themselves brought the young fox-boy to the peak of organism, his lush thighs shaking back and fourth in short thrusts as he humped the air, his loins begging for release. Cole didn’t know whether he did it unconsciously of whether he meant to, but he suddenly hopped forward, placing that erect foxhood of his just above the food bowl, yipping wildly as he let was about to let loose, but-<br />
<br />
“Shhsrrippp!”<br />
<br />
Cole’s mouth opened in a sudden flare of pain as the last thing he was missing was violently added to his body. A long, gangly tail exploded out of his tail bone, sending specks of blood flying this way and that as it shred through a layer of skin to sit in its rightful place above his butt. That gawky, extended tail bone suddenly puffed out with a fluffy floof of orange fuzz, leaving Cole with a tail almost the length of his body.<br />
<br />
It hurt… but it hurt just right. Cole just couldn’t contain his yowl of pleasure anymore as a powerful jet of virile fox seed gushed out. The load of jizz splashed into the bowl below him as wave after wave of mind-numbing bliss racked his little body. His cock controlled his entire being as it spurt out a hose worth of cum into the dog dish just underneath him, drenching the leftover sausage in in a gooey glaze of musky vulpine love. Cumming felt so much better now that his body was almost complete, his paws clenching against the floor in sheer adoration of his sexual prowess as he rode out that delicious bestial orgasm.<br />
<br />
Cole animal eyes were half-lidded as he felt the last few spurts of cum eek out from the tip of his penis. He looked back down towards the cum drenched meat, feeling all the more hungry as he peered at that bowl covered in his own kit batter. He spied a hotdog, smirking as the thought crossed his sex-addled mind that it looked almost like his own fox meat. He’d love to have another boy-fox to play with… he’d love to see what they taste like too.<br />
<br />
Cole’s muzzle dipped down as his lips grasped the sausage, pulling it into his maw without biting down. All the scarfing down food from before had absolutely destroyed his gag reflex, leaving the fox-boy calm and relaxed as he took the entire wiener into his mouth. Without chewing, he threw back his head and let that thick tube of cum-covered meat slide down his throat, the boy licking his chops as he felt is slowly make its way towards his plump vulpine stomach.<br />
<br />
It felt so good. Is that what playing with another boy fox would be like? Cole shivered in anticipation, huffing the air as he tried to sense another fox nearby. But then he realized, there was another fox! Foxy!<br />
<br />
The boy awkwardly picked himself back up on two legs, realizing he wasn’t quite a quadruped yet despite looking entirely like a fox. The boy lustily waddled towards his stuffed animal, sitting on top of the big fox plushie’s lap as he rubbed his rear against it.<br />
<br />
“F-foxshie… you haff wan of these tuuu, righ?” Cole panted with his tongue out as he tried to speak English to little avail, pointing to the plump, cream covered sheath on his belly that now held his spent canine cock. “Yuu been hidin’ ii from meh?”<br />
<br />
The boy’s hand-paws searched the toy’s groin for a sheath but couldn’t find it. Cole whimpered in desperation, wanting to see another fox’s cock so bad that he unconsciously began rubbing his rear against his toy. His anus felt warm a swollen, the rim of his ring puffing out as Cole rubbed that hot, sensitive foxhole against his plush best friend.<br />
<br />
“Ahn-… Foxshieeee, pleeeeaaassse…” Cole groaned, collapsing on top of his stuff toy as he slowly drifted to sleep.</p>
