<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up round 2, his arm draped over Anita and felt her supple breast. slowly an erection formed and he moved closer to Anita. He was the big spoon. A satisfied smile crossed Jeff&#39;s face. In some fundamental way he felt fulfilled.<br />
<br />
Dawn was breaking and though it was only 6:05, morning had come. Anita had begun reverting physically but the mental changes to their relationship, like last night, are the last to change. Jeff gently caressed his girlfriends boobs and the settings to alter reality were in full swing. Jeff felt his girlfriend&#39;s sparse chest hair and was careful not to pull it knowing she was sensitive about it and it was a very sensitive place for her.. He lay there for several moments listening to her breathe and he realized he needs to get ready for school and beating Anita to the bathroom would be wise.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized he wasn&#39;t going back to bed so he meandered to the main bathroom quietly, avoiding the master bathroom to avoid waking his girlfriend. He wondered what to do with the extra time he had as he thought jealously of how Anita&#39;s first college class doesn&#39;t start till noon and she doesn&#39;t have to work a shift today. As Jeff completed his morning business, Anita&#39;s changes continued and her masculine traits became more obvious and embarrassing for a woman given today&#39;s beauty standards. <br />
<br />
Jeff was still half asleep and had a vague sense that his dad would be there within an hour, but was still separating the identity of his dad from his girlfriend to keep things from being awkward. Jeff realized that he could use the Chronivac to fix Anita&#39;s masculinity concerns! Why didn&#39;t he think of this sooner? Jeff remembered doing something so he and Anita had the night alone but for some reason he didn&#39;t use the Chronivac on her last night to make her as radiant on the outside as she is on the inside. With a smile Jeff went to the spare office which was reverting back to his bedroom and pulled up the program...<br />
<br />
Jeff spent a few minutes looking through the array of packages before finding just the thing he was looking for. A gradual change package that is triggered by an event. Basically he just needed to define the end result, set a trigger, and tell it how many times or how long the triggering event has to happen. Jeff was surprised to see a 16 year old version of Anita loaded in the program, he didn&#39;t recall building a more feminine version of her but he had to admit, he did a damn good job.<br />
<br />
Now 6:25, the only problem was this version of her was 16 and it wouldn&#39;t be fair to remove almost half of her life from her and send her back into the throws of puberty. After all, her maturity was something Jeff really liked about her but their age difference was illegal and taboo. Anita was nearly twice Jeff&#39;s age, which was why he had to send his dad away for them to spend time together. With just a few click&#39;s Jeff sent the 16 year old profile of Anita through an age algorithm and dropped the resulting 23 year old version of the profile in as the end result without needing to tinker with thousands of individual variables. The program said it would remove any existing triggering events from the profile and Jeff said okay, still not piecing together what was happening. <br />
<br />
He set the triggering event to be any time they touched and set a duration of an hour. Reality will change to match and nobody will be aware of the changes. There is no point in remembering all the pain she went through as her body betrayed her, right? Now all they need to do is cuddle for an hour and her new feminine appearance will be complete.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to do a similar change to himself. He hated that he was still below the age of consent and realized he could fix that as Anita changed. Jeff saved a copy of his profile and dropped the file into the age algorithm but paused as a wave of disorientation washed over him... he blinked several times and looked at the clock, 6:30. <br />
<br />
In the master bedroom Jeff&#39;s very effeminate, secret boyfriend was sleeping soundly, Jeff had been typing away on the computer stored in the guest bedroom as Anita became John again. Because the nature of their relationship didn&#39;t change back to Father/Son yet, the dynamics of the relationship needed to, and did, change drastically.<br />
<br />
Jeff loved how feminine John was and as reality warped to ensure Jeff stayed in a strong relationship with John, Jeff found himself wanting to become the masculine, jack of all trades, white knight to counter balance John&#39;s effeminate persona. Jeff bit his lower lip, unsure how to use the program to ensure he had the skills they would need as a couple living together. Jeff found a masculation package, adding muscle mass, grilling skills, a taste for beer, a morning coffee habit, and interest in sports, among countless other details. Within a few more minutes he found a &quot;skills by osmosis&quot; package. Basically it sets up childhood memories of a neighbor a few houses down who you visited and questioned relentlessly, watching them work on things and learning the basics. You just select the topics and you will have a basic understanding and the confidence to start the project. Maintaining/fixing cars, plumbing, installing overhead lighting and ceiling fans, building things in the garage, laying carpet, gardening, and so on.<br />
<br />
Jeff ran the saved profile through the three packages selecting a gambit of skills. Though moments ago he loved how his significant other was older and more mature than him, Jeff now wanted to be older and wiser than John, to be his papa bear protector and shelter. Jeff remembered setting John up to become 23 and was originally going to become 18 but now was considering if he really wanted to make himself anything under 30. <br />
<br />
Jeff settled on 27 and reasoned he could always become older if he was less than satisfied, he set the same settings for his profile as he did the John/Anita profile and saved it. Now all he had to do was spend time touching his love and everything will work itself out...</p>
