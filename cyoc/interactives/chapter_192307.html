<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Molly had never seen her son so excited or intrigued by something in all her life, which wasn&#39;t to be unexpected. To realize that supernatural powers exist, and that you are a recipient of them, would overwhelm most people. Molly sure knew how shocked she was when her mother told her about her magical background at the age of twelve. <br />
<br />
Miles grabbed the spellbook and ran outside, not realizing that he was now wearing a black dress. <br />
<br />
Miles sprinted down the street and looked for the home of John and Margie Winston, a late middle-aged couple who lived with their dog, Rover. John worked nights, so while Miles was walking to school, he often passed by their house shortly after John had gotten home, and more often than not he heard screaming matches and verbal abuse by the older man against his wife. Despite being a juvenile delinquent himself, the abuse bothered Miles, and he often wondered if worse happened behind closed doors. Today he saw John outside mowing the front lawn.<br />
<br />
Molly ran after her son, not bothering with shutting the front door, much less locking it, before catching up with the goth witch to be. <br />
<br />
“Miles, what are you doing?” she asked, perplexed. <br />
<br />
“Watch!” said Miles with a huge grin on his face. He turned to a certain chapter of the spellbook, and once he found what he was looking for, he began to chant a spell:<br />
<br />
Miles then spoke in a magical language, imploring various gods well known and obscure to transform the couple, to alter their essences and to swap their genders. Molly recognized the spell, she had used it herself a few times when she was younger. <br />
<br />
“Miles, I think that&#39;s a bit too advanced for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
“No it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s like I instinctively just know how to do this stuff now! After I levitated that pencil, like a ton of information just poured inside my head!”<br />
<br />
As Miles concentrated on the spell, Molly noticed that Miles was acquiring more accessories adorning his person. His nails were turning a very dark black and were growing quite long, almost claw like. Each fingernail came with a purple design in the middle, Molly noticing that they were ancient Nordic runes(Molly was never very good at harnessing runic magic), but that wasn&#39;t all. Punk inspired spiked bracelets appeared on Miles&#39;s wrists. An elaborate and very pretty looking black choker with a red pendent in the middle appeared around his neck. His bare legs were now encased in black stockings, and his shoes were growing into a pair of gothic looking lace up boots. Finally, a streak of red and purple made its way into his midnight colored hair, now framing his face in a short but growing style. It was then when Molly noticed that Miles was now wearing some pretty black eye-shadow as well. <br />
<br />
“...Klatuu. That should do it” said Miles proudly, completing the spell. <br />
<br />
John continued to mow the lawn, not noticing either of the Johnson&#39;s watching him from across the street. Within thirty seconds, both Molly and Miles noticed that long brunette hair began to sprout from the top of a bald patch that John had on his scalp, and the rest of his hair followed suit, crawling down his face to his now more diminutive shoulder blades. He wiped the hair away from his face, not noticing the discrepancy, nor his shirt transforming into a lightweight female top.<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t believe this!” exclaimed Miles with a wide grin to his mother, grabbing her shoulders in affection. “It&#39;s actually working!” <br />
<br />
As the spell continued to work its magic, John the fifty-eight year old with a dad bod had rapidly turned into a charmingly cute girl next door in her late twenties. She was finally finished mowing the lawn, so she turned the motor off and wheeled it back into the backyard shed. She then walked to their front porch and sat on a big, comfortable wicker chair to take a breather.<br />
<br />
About a minute later, Molly and Miles witnessed a young man about the same age exiting from the Winston&#39;s front door. <br />
<br />
“Jane, honey? I made my favorite girl some lemonade for being such a hard worker” said the young man said with a grin, laying a pitcher and a glass on a porch table next to the cute woman. <br />
<br />
“Thank you Marcus” grinned Jane as she bit her lip. “What would I ever do without the best husband the world can ask for?” <br />
<br />
Jane gave Marcus a cute peck on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Miles began to dance and giggle a little bit. He was excited as he imagined a whole new world that he had just discovered through his mom, who obviously had more going on beneath the surface than he had given her credit for. Molly meanwhile simply had a coy smile on her face. Miles may be magical now, but he still didn&#39;t suspect a thing. <br />
<br />
Option 1: Molly convinces Miles to return to the house where she can show him some more advanced magic tricks in private, which Miles agrees to. In the middle of their session, he begins to age into his twenties. <br />
<br />
Option 2: Miles, now cocky, wants to transform more people and engage in karmic justice. Molly reluctantly agrees to allow Miles to transform just one more neighbor, but that&#39;s it. Meanwhile, Miles becomes taller and skinnier.</p>
