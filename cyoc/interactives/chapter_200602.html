<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joanna found the wine bottle sitting near the back of the kitchen counter, against the wall. She used her stepstool to get up to it, heaving her breasts onto the counter so she could grab it. She was ready. She could do this. This would be the last obstacle before some semblance of freedom.<br />
<br />
But something about the sight of the wine bottle made her feel... odd. It seemed almost as tall as she was, and she wasn&#39;t sure if her dainty hands could even wrap around its base. The shape of it, the thick glass bottle full of red liquid, tapering into the thinner neck, with the wooden cork plugging it at the tip...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was hard for her to ignore the phallic shape of it. As calm as she tried to remain, it just seemed to remind her of...<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad...&quot; She cooed.<br />
<br />
She ran a hand up and down its side. She wanted to pleasure it, rub it until it burst, spewing its seed all over her.<br />
<br />
She took a few deep breaths, licking her lips, then shook her head. She needed to focus. She had a job to do.<br />
<br />
She found the corkscrew and the wine glasses. She decided that the safest method would be to make multiple trips: carry the glasses in first and set the table, then bring the wine bottle in. She knew she&#39;d need two free hands to carry that monster.<br />
<br />
She grabbed a pair of glasses with each hand. Even if they were empty, her weak arms felt the strain. She walked toward the open door to the dining room, holding the glasses out to her side as she thrust her breasts out. She turned sideways, squeezing her ass and belly through the door. She got a bit stuck.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not now...&quot; She muttered. &quot;Goddammit, not now...&quot;<br />
<br />
With a flick of her hips, she managed to push through. As she walked toward the table, she felt herself lose her balance, sending one of her high-heeled shoe-wearing feet into the air behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; She cried.<br />
<br />
She tried her best to balance herself, and hopped a few times on her other foot. Her breasts and ass shook wildly, until she eventually came to a stop. She let out a deep sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; she said out loud. The dinner guests were mostly ignoring her, having their own conversation, although she could swear she saw her mother glance at her a couple of times.<br />
<br />
Joanna quietly set the four glasses in their places with little trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Chad,&quot; Gloria said. &quot;What are you studying at college?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Business,&quot; Chad said. &quot;Going for an MBA.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How nice,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do great. What do you plan on doing after?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Real estate, maybe. Renting property out. I think I&#39;d like to start a company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, our JW app has been doing very well recently. I&#39;m sure with your vision, you could take it in some even more profitable directions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve been thinking about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna let out a sigh as she turned back to the kitchen. She probably wouldn&#39;t see any of those profits either. She thought about what it would take for her to run away from here. If it would even be possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer here is planning to go into Biology,&quot; Gloria said. &quot;She just got back from studying abroad at a prestigious university in Paris.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; Chad said, smiling politely at Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; Joanna asked.<br />
<br />
The room fell dead silent as the three looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you, dear?&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t I going to college?&quot; She felt so stupid. She genuinely didn&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
Jennifer giggled knowingly. Gloria just looked annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you barely graduated high school,&quot; she started. &quot;Then you couldn&#39;t even get into the public colleges, your test scores were so bad. You didn&#39;t even want to go to community college. You had no idea what you wanted to study.&quot;<br />
<br />
She waved her phone in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you had me use your college fund to start the Joanna&#39;s World app instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Joanna said, her heart sinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea was ridiculous,&quot; Gloria continued. &quot;And, honestly, incredibly embarrassing for our family. What do I tell my friends? &#39;Oh, my youngest is going to find the cure for cancer. My older girl? She sexually humiliates herself in front of cameras, for strangers online.&#39; Just pitiful. At least it&#39;s going to let me retire early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna clenched her fists, as she started to feel choked up. This whole thing was her own idea? Her college fund, used up entirely to fund the source of her humiliation? She couldn&#39;t believe it, but she didn&#39;t know any different. For all she knew, what her mother was saying was completely true.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go get the wine,&quot; she said. She needed a drink. The sooner she finished this, the sooner she could go to her bed and pass out for the night.<br />
<br />
Gloria waved her away, not even looking at her.<br />
<br />
She stumbled back into the kitchen, wiping some tears from her eyes. She grabbed the corkscrew and walked back to the wine bottle. She stepped back up onto the stool. First one tit hefted onto the counter again, then another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost done...&quot; She muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
She realized she wasn&#39;t sure how she would uncork the bottle. With how weak she was, she felt like she needed it to be on the floor. She set the corkscrew aside on the counter, then grabbed the bottle with both hands. Dragging it backwards, she pulled it between her breasts. She stepped off the stool, as she carefully slid the bottle and her heavy tits off the edge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...&quot; She grunted. The bottle dropped like a rock. She held it from the base with both hands, with the neck falling between her tits. She looked down at it. The shape of it was turning her on. It made her want, &quot;Chad!&quot; She wanted him to lay his massive cock in between her breasts, so he could titfuck her. She wanted him to shove his tip into her eager mouth, running her tongue up and down its-<br />
<br />
Joanna came to her senses, realizing she had started fellating the wine bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; she said, releasing the cork-tipped neck from her mouth. It was covered in her saliva. &quot;I can&#39;t control myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
She rubbed it against her tits, trying to clean it off, but this only served to turn her on more. Thinking quickly, she turned back to the corkscrew on the counter. She bit down on its wooden handle with her mouth, giving it something to occupy itself with. She breathed through her nose and sighed. At least she wouldn&#39;t need to make another trip.<br />
<br />
Turning toward the door, she began to crouch-waddle her way out of the room. She felt the dildo&#39;s testicles drag along the floor. She felt like she&#39;d probably need to clean the floors when this whole thing was done, with how much she was leaking.<br />
<br />
As she returned to the dining room, she set the bottle on the floor slowly. She quickly impaled the cork with the screw. She held the bottle between her flabby legs as she pulled up on the corkscrew handle like it was a sword in a stone. After some loud grunting, she heard a satisfying *pop*. The cork was out. She put the corkscrew handle back in her mouth so she could focus.<br />
<br />
Now, she needed to pour the damn thing. She managed to get her hands back underneath the base of the bottle. As she lifted it up, she found it a nigh impossible task to bring it up high enough to pour it into her mother&#39;s glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrass?&quot; Joanna mumbled with her mouth full, hoping that her mother would meet her halfway and bring her glass down to her level.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Gloria glanced down at her. &quot;What are you waiting for? A good waitress can pour wine for her guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna groaned quietly. She carefully moved a hand up to the neck. Letting out a loud grunt, she lifted the base with one hand as she struggled to bring it up to the table. Her legs were shaking, and her back felt sore.<br />
<br />
A splash of red liquid fell onto Joanna&#39;s face and chest. She quickly stopped herself, returning to her earlier two-handed hold on the bottle&#39;s base.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, hurry up, already,&quot; Jennifer said. &quot;I&#39;ll just do it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer reached down, grabbing the neck of the bottle with one of her large hands. She effortlessly lifted it, pouring wine into each glass completely one-handed, then set it down on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Jennifer,&quot; Gloria said. &quot;What terrible service.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joanna spat out the corkscrew and hung her head as she walked to her chair. She licked her chest clean of the fairly light splash of red wine. It tasted pretty good to her. Not that she knew anything about wine.<br />
<br />
&quot;A toast!&quot; Gloria announced. &quot;To Chad&#39;s new acquisition!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To Chad!&quot; Jennifer said, holding up her wine glass.<br />
<br />
Chad nodded, holding up his glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;To...&quot; Joanna began, reaching for her glass. She realized that it was still empty. &quot;Chad...&quot; She moaned.<br />
<br />
Gloria, Jennifer, and Chad clinked their glasses together, then each drank from them.<br />
<br />
Joanna was frustrated. She deserved a drink as much as anyone else at the table, maybe even more so. She reached out for the bottle, pulling it toward her with both hands. She managed to tilt it enough to pour the wine, but not without spilling it on her arm and chest as well. Most of it ended up on her, rather than in the glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;What on Earth are you doing?&quot; Gloria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pouring myself a glass of wine,&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you forget? You&#39;re underage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But-but-but... Jenny, and Chad!&quot; She moaned loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re mature enough to have some. I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ve proved that you are. Besides, with your weak and tiny body, you probably can&#39;t even hold your liquor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; Joanna said, licking herself clean.<br />
<br />
Jennifer giggled as she finished downing her own glass.<br />
<br />
Joanna grabbed her half-empty wine glass with both hands, lifting it up to her mouth carefully. Of course, she ended up spilling some of it onto her, but she managed to swallow most of it.<br />
<br />
But as she was cleaning herself off again, she began to feel a bit strange. Dizzy, drowsy, woozy. She clutched her head, then sat back in her chair. She let out a hiccup, followed by a loud belch. She felt like she was losing consciousness.<br />
<br />
The last thing she saw was her mother staring at her with a smug grin on her face. Her voice echoed as Joanna slowly blacked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you so...&quot;<br />
<br />
The next morning, Joanna woke up, hungover.</p>
