<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I have the perfect idea.&quot; Astarael suddenly said, standing up out of his chair and sitting on the side of the bed. &quot;What was it you told me? Go find a fag bar and stick to my own kind?&quot; The demon reached out and pressed a clawed fingertip to Charlie&#39;s chest, just over his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; A slight burning in his forehead made him quickly add, &quot;sir. Please, just, let me go.&quot; Charlie gave another tug on his restraints, his earlier bravado evaporating as everything suddenly came crashing down around him, but his new master wasn&#39;t listening. Instead the demon began to chant something as his claw pressed through Charlie&#39;s chest. It hurt like he was being cut open and scoured raw, but no blood welled up from the wound. The chanting only stopped as the claw tip tapped against his heart.<br />
<br />
The skin around where the finger stabbed him started to darken slightly, at first Charlie thought it was burning but as it spread out he realized it was his skin tone changing from his pale skinned complexion to a light bronze. Astarael pulled his finger free from Charlie&#39;s chest, leaving not even a mark behind except for the darker tone spreading across his chest and now down his stomach. His nipples took on an even darker tone as it passed over them.<br />
<br />
As the wave his hair, the first being one of the blond bushes in his armpits, the hair turned completely black, first one pit, then the other. Even the very faint treasure trail that started around his navel suddenly was more noticeable as the hair darkened. The wave of darkening skin passed over his face altering more than just skin color. His lips plumped slightly, his nose becoming more broad as his blue eyes swirled to a deep brown. His brows looked thicker as they darkened and his cheekbones seemed more prominent. Creeping towards his hairline, the blond hair on his head turned the same deep black and gained a natural wavy curl.<br />
<br />
Below the waist his cock darkened to the same deeper color as his nipples sticking up from a burly black bush, though skin pushed up from the shaft and engulfed the head of his cock as his foreskin regrew in a matter of seconds. Down his arms and legs the previous hard to see peach like fuzz of his arm and leg hair suddenly could be seen as black on tan. &quot;What.. what are..&quot; Charlie was gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on, Charlie. I know how you see Latinos, your family is rich and white, you&#39;ve always seen them as hired help, welfare leeches, less than other people. I couldn&#39;t let that pass. This is part of your punishment, seeing how those you wronged live. But be quiet, I need to concentrate, we&#39;re far from done.&quot; The demon smiled as he reached over and wrapped his hand around Charlie&#39;s cock. It instantly sprang to attention.<br />
<br />
He wanted to scream for him to let go, but another growing part of him wanted to be jacked off by this demon. His eyes ran over the barely hidden muscles under the fabric of that shirt, the discernable bulge between the demon&#39;s legs he had barely noticed before, that stubble, the smile.. all of it was turning him on. Then Astarael began to slowly stroke him, the feeling was electric, the new sensation of a foreskin running between the hand and his shaft and the strong grip of that rough hand on his cock. &quot;See. I told you. If you let yourself learn the lesson you might find some pleasure in this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The electric buzz running through him turned to fire. And as he let his head roll back to the pillows he saw why. His body was going through even more changes. It was like he was going through another puberty. His body was getting bigger, his 5&#39;9&quot; frame gaining a couple more inches, but it was more than that. His shoulders were growing broader, his jaw more square, and even his hands and feet were getting bigger. Though the restraints on him still remained perfectly sized to keep him in place.<br />
<br />
His muscles were growing, too. From a lean frame with barely any definition, seeing the sudden pop and swell of muscle growth was.. well.. it was erotic. It seemed with each breath his chest pushed out a little more, his abs tightened up as he strained against his cuff. Each tug of his arms and legs came with more power behind it as the muscles in his limbs grew. He was no muscle monster, but he was fit and toned. Ever second traces of his boyishness vanished under manliness.<br />
<br />
The shadows between his pecs and abs darkened. No.. it wasn&#39;t shadows. It was hair growing in. His chin and upper lip darkened with stubble as well that slowly grew up his cheeks and met with descending sideburns. Hair and his arms and legs filled out more. The surprise was the amount of covering on his chest and abs, it was short but the coverage was almost complete across his firm pecs, a neat line down the middle of his abs. But not a lick of hair on his shoulders or probably even his back. It was like he was being designed as some sort of.. sex fantasy. His eyes flicked over to Michelle. Just like she was.<br />
<br />
He realized with a moment of despair that her body just didn&#39;t do anything for him. Even naked and pressed up against the door frame, watching him with keen interest. He could tell she was beautiful but just not what he wanted anymore. It was that strong firm grip on his cock bringing him closer and closer to climax. And just on the edge of coming, the hand came off his cock. He practically whimpered as he looked to the demon. &quot;No, sir, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
The demon brought his hand to his mouth, sucking on two fingers for a moment before positioning them at the entrance to Charlie&#39;s ass. &quot;You want this don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie shut his eyes, feeling shame flood him but he nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say it.&quot; The demon said, his voice commanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want it, sir.&quot; And then he felt those fingers push inside him, pressing against something deep inside him he didn&#39;t know was there, and that was all it took to push him over the edge. He felt his cock explode, he felt hot cum splash across his new pecs and chest hair, then everything went black.<br />
<br />
Charlie woke up in a completely different room. There was still a mirror on the ceiling but the apartment wasn&#39;t the slightly upscale one Michelle had but a lower-end studio apartment Charlie one would never have been caught dead in. It was clean and tidy, but obviously not luxury. He pulled back the sheets, expecting them to stick to his dried cum, but he was clean and still completely naked. It hadn&#39;t been a dream though, he was in the body of some mid-twenties Latino stud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning.&quot; Charlie shot up out of bed and turned to face the voice. Astarael sat in a chair by a window, back to his human shape though wearing a black tank top and jeans rather than the nice business wear of last night. He was looking through a file folder, a newspaper neatly folded up beside him.<br />
<br />
Charlie wanted to scream at him, to shout, but every time those thoughts passed through his head his forehead burned more and he couldn&#39;t get his mouth to work until he uttered a, &quot;Good morning, sir.&quot; And the pain subsided. Strangely he noticed a bit of an accent to his words.<br />
<br />
The demon nodding approvingly. &quot;You&#39;ll find I implanted a few new memories in your head to help you with your new life. Names, places, the entire Spanish language, things like that. You are now Carlos Diaz, born in San Juan, you moved to this city as a teenager when your family disowned you for being gay. A few years working manual labor jobs.. Now you work at a gay bar called the Naughty Imp. You bartend, sometimes bounce, and sometimes dance, sometimes do other things if the pay is right.&quot; He tossed the file on the bed. &quot;I&#39;ll leave that for you to look over if you want.&quot; Then he tapped the newspaper. &quot;And a little article you might find amusing. Your first shift starts at five tonight. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astarael stood up and walked over to Carlos until he was just inches away. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to think of himself as anything other than Carlos, not anymore. He felt a hand gripping his his ass, pulling him in close until he was pressed up against the demon. Big as Carlos was now, Astarael still had quite a bit more muscle, a body builder&#39;s physique. Their lips met, and he felt the demon&#39;s tongue sliding between his lips. He wanted to both pull away and melt into the embrace at the same time. Breaking the kiss, the demon laughed. &quot;A little taste of how I treat those who make me proud. If not..&quot; There was a flash of pain through Carlos&#39; skull, blurring his vision and making him nearly fall over. But when his vision cleared, the demon was gone.<br />
<br />
So why did he feel like he was still being watched?<br />
<br />
He walked over to the newspaper left behind and noticed it was folded open to a specific article. &#39;Trust Fund Teen Found Dead - Early yesterday morning Charlie Westworth was found dead of alcohol poisoning..&#39; Carlos dropped the paper unwilling to read any more and sat on the edge of his bed. What was he going to do now?</p>
