<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had already been two days. Two days, and Dan wasn´t any wiser what exactly happened to him.<br />
<br />
From the feeling alone, his thumbs should be just blobs of formless flesh by now. He felt they were sucked the whole time, remaining in a wet feeling even when not sucked on for about ten minutes every few hours. And of course, sometimes the sucking on one stopped shortly, only for it to feel like being hit with a hammer or something else heavy suddenly. Mostly followed by something resembling boiling hot water being poured over them. As if the squished thumb needed cleaning.<br />
<br />
The ten-minute break periods, in which his thumbs weren´t sucked on, it was his big toes that felt like that instead. Adding to the sucking was an unnatural warmth passing through them. Followed by first the same boiling hot feeling his thumbs got after being hit hard, and then being rubbed with a cloth or something similar. Just, there was nothing even near them at the time to emit that feeling.<br />
<br />
His mouth hadn´t gotten any better over the two days, either. Nearly the whole day it was dry and crusty, only maybe an hour after school it was suddenly pushed open, filled by something invisible, and rubbed around whatever it was. When that procedure ended, his mouth felt warm, wet and sticky for about half an hour, as if again drying out from whatever had been inside. Dan was still without any taste, everything just a bland mass of nothing, maybe a little salt in it. And he also had no idea why his mouth was forced shut in the night, an invisible pressure keeping it closed for hours. No way for him to drink, speak or even scream for that time. And if something left his mouth in that time, it was light moaning.<br />
<br />
Then there was his cock. It still hadn´t gone down, always staying at full mast, tenting his pants tightly. He had heard more than a few people snickering by now, and was red a lot of time for it, making the whispering and pointing even worse. But no amount of working on his cock helped. He pumped it, tried to masturbate it down, even took an ice-cold shower and holding ice cubes to it, but nothing. Oh, the cold had been bordering painful to him, but his cock stayed as it was.<br />
<br />
Lastly, there had been the hard beating his ass would get at night, around the time he went to bed or was just starting to doze off. It felt like someone was fucking him hard, not that he had that experience to call it like that. It was brutal to him, but even then, his cock remained unyielding. Meaning he was rolling around, too hurt by the beating to get up, but laying on his pole was just as painful. And when the beating was done, his ass felt sore and wet. There was nothing in it, he had even fingered himself each time to search for the wetness, but again, nothing. And as if the beatings weren´t enough, it was always followed by a similar hot feeling than his thumbs and big toes got, as if cleaned out by boiling water before being rubbed dry with a rough cloth. It always left Dan sobbing for some time.  But as it was paired with the closed mouth part, Dan at least didn´t wake his family with screams of pain or anything like that.<br />
<br />
And he couldn´t talk about it, always maneuvering around the topic if he tried to explain it to anyone. He had trouble walking in the morning, and sitting down made him want to scream as well, but he could suppress it mostly. But maybe that was part of whatever made him unable to talk about it, as well.<br />
<br />
Kat, meanwhile, was confused. She saw her brother was affected by her spell, and was sure his ass was connected to her boyfriend´s fleshlight, which he had used every night this week, but she hadn´t heard Dan scream even once. She knew her boyfriend wasn´t doing light with it, so how was Dan not screaming in pain each night? Was he that unaffected by pain?<br />
She could see him limping in the morning, and hear him moan in pain when he sat down, but that was it. And she didn´t dare to go to her brother´s room to view him at night, knowing he would be awake when it started, and her looking in would make him aware that she knew something. Sadly, she hadn´t found any spell to look through the wall or closed door.<br />
In her frustration that evening, Kat decided to test out her birthday present, as Max hadn´t been able to come over today. Maybe tonight Dan would scream when Max used his fleshlight, but for now, Kat needed her new toy. With little ceremony she opened her hidden drawer under her bed, pulling out the dildo she had got from Max. “Time to test this thing out” went through her, as she quickly had closed her door before and locked it, making sure no one would disturb her.<br />
<br />
Dan was playing something on his computer when he felt something new. It felt as if someone had just grabbed his cock hard, making him yelp. Looking down, there was nothing to see but his still tented shorts. “What´s happening?” he asked himself, wondering if his cock was to experience anything now. And then, about a minute after he felt it being grabbed, he felt something press down on the tip, and quickly engulfing his length, making him moan. His door was closed, luckily, but even if not, his parents were out this evening. But it would be embarrassing if Kat came in now.<br />
Over the next couple of minutes, Dan moaned as his cock was being squeezed from all sides, pushed in and out of whatever invisible force was there. If he hadn´t been alone right now, he would think he was fucking a girl with a tight little pussy. Adding to the squeezing and pushing was a light vibration going through his cock, as if he was using a vibrator with it. But what really got to him was the stimulation it brought to him. All his tries to masturbate these last days hadn´t helped his pent-up cock, and now whatever was happening did. He cummed into his underwear and shorts within two minutes of the whole thing, and it didn´t stop there.<br />
By the time the whole thing stopped, Dan had creamed himself three times, making his cock and balls now throb in a little pain from overuse. Not that Dan noticed that right now, still simmering in the afterglow. But it was short-lived, as all of the sudden his cock was burned in a similar way his ass would be, making him scream lightly, his voice a bit rough from moaning the whole time. It was only a few seconds, making him now whimper in pain, as it added to the overuse-pain he now could feel. And like with his ass, some cloth was rubbed over his sensitive parts, and he gave a mix between a whimper and a moan for it.<br />
After a light hit to the tip of his cock, everything was over, and Dan sat there, his game ended by his inability to play, with him still not understanding what had happened. It had been somewhat the best orgasm he had in his life, but he didn´t understand what had started this. And what was weird, his cock was still at full mast, even with everything out it didn´t go down like he had hoped.<br />
<br />
Kat had used her little toy for some time, enjoying the vibrations and her pushing it in and out of her pussy. She had no idea that she had just ridden her brother´s cock, forcing him to orgasm three times. As she cleaned the dildo, she thought she heard a light scream coming from Dan´s room, but to her it didn´t sound hurt. Most likely he had just lost in a game or something like that. After cleaning the dildo with hot water and drying it with a towel, she placed it back into its little hiding place tip first, and went back to do something else.<br />
But as she had enjoyed her toy in a way, she hadn´t felt with Max before, she was sure to use the dildo now daily, only to pause when Max was over for her.<br />
<br />
Dan had no idea about his sister´s thoughts. His days went on like the last did, only now he would also get these uses of his cock every night, and to make it even more bad for him, Kat used his cock around the same time as Max used his ass, while Harry pressed down on his mouth, making Dan experience this all without any loud sound leaving him. He was a moaning mess for hours even after everything was over, making him have sleeping troubles to add to his other problems.</p>
