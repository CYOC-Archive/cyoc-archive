<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So... THIS is where you&#39;re hiding,&quot; came a female voice that echoed through a barn on Jason Quill&#39;s ranch.<br />
<br />
Daniel Parker turned and around and found the source of the voice that was fairly easy. The Parker and Erickson had come up to the Quill ranch for the summer, on what he surmised was something more of a vacation for his mom, his mom&#39;s friend, and the girl he&#39;d had something of a crush on for the longest time ever. Much of which being a break from some of the pressures that came with them becoming Lion Animalians on Mother&#39;s Day as a result of some mail mishaps that Daniel wasn&#39;t quite sure on how that actually came about. Some of the pressures that had been there for them in Wall made some of that reasoning obvious.<br />
<br />
The state was pretty solidly anti-Animalian in various regards. There were no laws that Daniel knew of that forbade being an Animalian or even what species to become if one were to be an Animalian, but that didn&#39;t mean that prejudice wasn&#39;t there. And despite knowing his mother, his neighbor and her daughter for years, many of their neighbors had seemed to act with suspicion when three new Lioness Animalians did anything. There had been some other pressures that had been put on Amelia back in the school year after Mother&#39;s day, and from what Daniel heard, it wasn&#39;t particularly polite. The trip up to this rural ranch that technically wasn&#39;t grouped in with any town in McPherson County for the summer seemed to be set up their escape. They&#39;d paid for some local lawn care guys to take care of the lawns and make sure neither house burned down or anything and came up.<br />
<br />
Jason Quill had seemed like a polite enough man to give his mom and her friend that sort of access for freedom from many of those pressures, and Daniel sort of got a quasi feeling of guilt from the Human rancher. He could accept that, and in some ways, while ranch work wasn&#39;t something he was familiar with, there were some elements of it that he didn&#39;t mind. At times it left him alone where he could avoid some of the protective growls that his mother couldn&#39;t resist giving when Amy or especially when Felicia seemed to show interest in him. And while the barn didn&#39;t exactly smell the best, it was a spot that he could be alone to think on things, even if it also meant being out in the heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not hiding,&quot; Daniel answered, &quot;I&#39;m just not staying out in the open.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;d get sunburned,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;and last thing I want is my future mate being all red.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel looked down to see Amy flash a toothy grin before approaching the ladder that he&#39;d climbed to get to this second level. Once she reached it, she reached around the dusty level to test the strength of the wood boards. They didn&#39;t grown too much and they didn&#39;t look so old that they&#39;d splinter to Daniel. Once Amy was satisfied in thinking that the level would hold her weight, she hoped onto it took a quadrupedal stance, noting that some of the spaces on the ranch weren&#39;t built for a Lioness Animalian. She rubbed the side of her left shoulder and side against Daniel&#39;s back and nuzzled Daniel with her head, eventually pushing his chest back to where he was reclined against her. Daniel hoped she didn&#39;t see him blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what were you thinking about?&quot; Amy asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just on how some things have changed,&quot; Daniel commented on how things had changed for both of them, and some things going back to when their parents first came up to the Quill ranch to scout it...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The pair of them arrived at the Parker home fairly late on a Friday afternoon. Daniel had some track and field practice after school and couldn&#39;t go home right after school ended, and Amy had largely been quite content to wait for Daniel to finish practice. Thus while he ran laps, stretched, and practiced throwing the shock-put and discuss as part of the practice, he&#39;d noted Amy sitting in the stands. She had her backpack with her with a books and papers in her lap and he guessed at times she was working on her homework. Though, at other times, she seemed to be following him closely with her eyes. Thankfully, things remained quiet and no one on the track team gave Amy trouble, at least nothing beyond some of the cold and semi-nervous shoulders that she&#39;d been getting, particularly from some of the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;At last... the weekend,&quot; Amy said as they took a few steps in, &quot;no more school pressure... and it&#39;s just you and me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel nodded a bit. He knew that their respective parents, Meredith and Felicia had gone out looking for a face to face meeting with Jason Quill, the man who had actually ordered the cream that was carrying the African Lion strain of the Animalia Virus, and that would likely be an all day drive just to get there, given that they&#39;d have to cross the Missouri River and then go north toward the border with North Dakota to get to McPherson county. It was a place that Daniel had never been before, but he was fairly sure that no interstate like I-90 ran north to that county, and given that the street address had no city attached, he was also fairly sure that Mr. Quill lived in a fairly rural part of that county to not be attached to a town or city. Though, Meredith and Felicia were expected back some time over the weekend, and the coming track meet was a home one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want anything? I&#39;m going to get a soda,&quot; Daniel spoke as he went ahead toward the kitchen while he heard his girlfriend shut the door behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than a cuddle and a quickie, I&#39;m fine,&quot; came Amy&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
Daniel ignored some of that and made his way into the kitchen after tossing his backpack onto the floor in the living room. Granted he&#39;d have most of the weekend for homework, as his events in the track meet the next day wouldn&#39;t take up all of the day things would be expected to be over by around three in the afternoon, but he also knew he couldn&#39;t just toss everything to the last minute. He didn&#39;t have the greatest grades and wasn&#39;t entirely sure on what he wanted to do. The only long term plan he had was to be with Amy, and that still all came with the surprises that had come from her unexpected transformation into an Animalian. He&#39;d always had a bit of a crush on her, and that had in part been why he&#39;d always been open to letting her hang out with him and his friends over the years. But he also never expected her to have a crush on him in return. But that would likely require conversion and he knew that becoming an Animalian wasn&#39;t entirely cheap, even when the delivery services got the addresses right. That kept him thinking on doing his best to get the best grades he could, for if his mom let him convert over the summer to be with Amelia, he&#39;d likely lose out on any football, basketball, or track scholarships that he might have hoped for.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a coke from the refrigerator and then moved to head back to the living room where he’d left Amy. He found her standing in the middle of the room and with the curtains drawn so that no one could see in from the outside, though he also could quickly see why the blinds were drawn and that very nearly made him drop the can of Coca-Cola in his hand. For she was also there in little more than her bra and panties, with the rest of her clothes left laying on the floor. The open eyes and playful licking of her muzzle also gave Daniel a hint that some of what was on Amy&#39;s mind wasn&#39;t homework. It served as a reminder on just how much things had changed between them.<br />
<br />
Before Mother&#39;s Day, the pair of them had been friends. He&#39;d had something of a crush on her, but was too afraid to act on it for fear that the attraction wasn&#39;t returned and thus didn&#39;t want to lose their friendship by going for more. Finding out when Amy moved to kiss and lick at his face with her transformation completed that she&#39;d actually had a bit of a crush on him was a surprise, as he didn&#39;t think they&#39;d both have that interest and then hide it for the same reasons. A part of him was very happy to have Amy&#39;s attention, and the teenage male part of him wasn&#39;t opposed to a woman with wide hips and a large bust being into him. But there was also the fact that Amy had become an Animalian, and specifically on based off of Africa&#39;s most dominant predator. It had done wonders for Amy&#39;s confidence, but Daniel also knew that he did anything that broke her heart, he&#39;d risk a world of hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I... uh...&quot; was all Daniel could stammer out as Amy looked to him. <br />
<br />
It left him wondering if this was Amy dealing more with Animalian instincts. As it was well known that Animalians had a higher libido than most Humans. And in finding out about each other&#39;s crushes, he wondered if Amy as leaving herself a bit open to her new libido to try and get him to act on it. Though, it also seemed to inspire more protective instincts in his mother, particularly when Felicia gave him looks like the one that Amy was giving him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do I look?&quot; Amy asked as she twirled and doing her best to make sure her tail didn&#39;t knock over anything as she spun in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very curvy,&quot; Daniel managed as he watched his girlfriend&#39;s large fur covered boobs sway with her movement and only just being restrained by the bra she was still wearing. He could feel his pants tightening as other parts of him also responded to the show that Amy was giving.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is, isn&#39;t it,&quot; Amy nodded, &quot;and we&#39;re all alone... we have all afternoon. And all night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We still have homework to work on,&quot; Daniel pointed out nervously. The teenager in him was not entirely opposed to sex, particularly with how sexy Amy had become as an Animalian, but that also had its own problems.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... not ALL afternoon,&quot; Amy gave a sigh, &quot;but... we&#39;d have some time for SOME fun, right? As boyfriend and girlfriend... after finding out that we&#39;d both been crushing on the other?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A part of me would really like to,&quot; Daniel said slowly.<br />
<br />
The response was to be pulled into a tight hug and then lifted a bit into the air. Amy&#39;s nose nuzzled against his cheek and soon followed that up with a very sensual lick in the same area. It wasn&#39;t predatory or aggressive, but like all cats, lions had barbed tongues, and thus the lick felt a bit rougher than what Amy probably hoped it would feel. Though, when she noted Daniel&#39;s raised eyebrows she paused and frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Amy asked, sounding a little frustrated with what she was beginning to sense the answer to what her desires fully was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... for one thing, I&#39;d think my mom would know when she and your mom get back,&quot; Daniel pointed out, &quot;I mean... lions aren&#39;t exactly bloodhounds, but it isn&#39;t as though they have a bad sense of smell. Males often use their noses to see if a female is receptive to mating and all that. So, they&#39;d know if we did something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they approve of us dating,&quot; Amy pointed out, &quot;Mom and I... well... we&#39;ve also begun to bond a bit more like sisters since all this happened. I think she knew and hoped that we&#39;d find each other. So, she wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mom, might,&quot; Daniel reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more her being upset that her cub is growing up,&quot; Amy countered, &quot;and even there... I think she&#39;d also accept us as mates. And as my mom, your mom, and I form a pride... we&#39;ll need a big pride male, which you&#39;d fit quite nicely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that,&quot; Daniel said as he looked down, &quot;but... Amy... with my crush and all... it... it was only with you. I mean, we&#39;ve had so much fun as friends. You&#39;ve hung out with me and my friends. We&#39;ve done all sorts of other stuff... and... I... I may have been afraid to tell you I had a crush on you... but it was only on you. But lions are polygamous... a great many animals are, actually, and, well... the state has laws against polygamy, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the wedding would only be between you and me,&quot; Amy reasoned, &quot;my mom would just be a friend with benefits for you. And it wouldn&#39;t be something super common. Just to keep her proverbial engine from exploding. And my mom... well... if all things go super well with this Quill guy, he may still become a Lion Animalian and you and he could be in coalition. And my mom and your mom could share him... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m NOT sharing you with another man,&quot; Daniel blurted, far louder and far more forceful than he wanted to. He covered his moth when he realized he&#39;d said it and wasn&#39;t sure on where all that came from. Amy only smiled back at him and let out a low rumble, almost as if she were trying to purr, which big cats, like lions, couldn&#39;t do.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;ll make a big strong Lion Animalian,&quot; Amy said with a smile, and then licked her lips, &quot;and if you turn out as I imagine you&#39;ll turn out... I won&#39;t need another male. So... why not get in practice now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you and I both know that would get you in trouble,&quot; Daniel told her, &quot;remember that a double dosed Animalian is treated as an an ADULT regardless of their age. Thus... if we do anything... YOU could be charged with statutory rape in this state until I&#39;m already a double dosed Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel moved to wrap his arms around Amy, and while it ended up with his head resting on the top of her bra covered bosom, he was doing all he could to make sure the interaction wasn&#39;t sexual. It was hard, as the teenager in him certainly wanted to, particularly when with a girl his own age who had the body of a very sexy adult and as both of them were finding real love blooming between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t want you to get in trouble,&quot; Daniel said to her.<br />
<br />
That got Amy to hug him back and some of the &quot;playfulness&quot; fell out of her voice when she answered, &quot;okay... we can focus on homework. But I&#39;m staying like this. It may not be warm enough yet to put the AC on... but I&#39;d like to avoid being overheated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Daniel managed to answer.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And things have changed even more from there,&quot; Daniel then commented as he looked over into Amy&#39;s eyes, &quot;we up hear... helping a guy run his ranch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s not super bad work and isn&#39;t quite as heavy as I would have thought,&quot; Amy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because we arrived after calving season and when they&#39;re trying to get animals vaccinated,&quot; Daniel shrugged, and watched Amy shrug as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while there aren&#39;t an awful lot of trees here, there&#39;s also seemed to be plenty of deer,&quot; Amy commented, &quot;mom and I stumbled onto a fawn that was laying in some bushes by a creek. I had all I could do to keep from chasing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s more our moms that are struggling with things,&quot; Daniel commented, &quot;I think Mr. Quill made quite the impression on them when they first visited that weekend after Mother&#39;s Day. My mom won&#39;t openly show it... but I think she likes him. I can see it when your mom flirts with him my mom tries to hide looking jealous...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Quill looks kinda cute when he blushes when they get into it,&quot; Amy chuckled, &quot;might make our parents to look into something more permanent up here. Register for school and either stay as guests or see if we could buy a plot to build some trailers... Though, that&#39;s all anyone&#39;s guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the biggest change will be when... and if... the latest attempt at the Horizon order goes correctly,&quot; Daniel commented, &quot;as I think Mr. Quill still wants to be a Lion Animalian... which may be part of what&#39;s got our moms so interested in him. And... I&#39;d kind of need it to be with you... and try to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel looked down toward his knees while a blush grew in his cheeks. It didn&#39;t dissipate as Amy nuzzled her muzzle into the right side of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m most looking forward to that,&quot; Amy smiled, &quot;you&#39;ll be double dosed... We&#39;ll become bond mates, get married, and make lots of babies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all at once...&quot; Daniel blinked, &quot;I&#39;d like to graduate high school first and know what I&#39;m going to do for the future... You know... be able to keen you and all those babies in a stable environment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After high school, sure,&quot; Amy agreed, &quot;but don&#39;t get too worried. So long as we&#39;re together... every change will be great.&quot;</p>
