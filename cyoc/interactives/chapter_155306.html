<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eli woke up feeling better then he had in a while. The main source of enjoyment was the college girl whom he thought was half his age. Pushing back the covers on the bad, Eli could only smile seeing that he was still buried in her pussy with her legs wrapped around his waist. Ever so gently, Eli moved her legs and slowly slid out of her vagina, causing her to moan with pleasure.<br />
	<br />
Getting up and stretching, Eli loved the way that after just waking up, his muscles looked pumped. Walking into the bathroom, Eli examined his reflection. Wide shoulders, tapered down to threaded eight pack abs and an eight inch cock with large balls. Because of the width of his back and the fact that his arms were now getting close to eighteen inches, Eli was forced to hold his arms at an angle. His legs were also now massive. Though not as massive as Gary, Eli had recently noticed that he was having to strut a little in order that his thighs did not get in the way of each other. <br />
	<br />
When soft hands appeared around his sides and reached down to his hardening cock, Eli almost blew his load then and there from the fact that his body now could complete hide his conquest from the mirror.<br />
	<br />
“Hey babe. Come back to bed.” The girl said in a sultry voice standing on her toes to look over his shoulder.<br />
	<br />
“No can do, love. I’ve got to be at work in just over an hour, but if you want to join me for a shower, I will make sure you are clean and ready for the day.”<br />
	<br />
As she headed over to the shower, Eli could not resist giving her a light smack on her ass and she swayed her hips. Giggling, she grabbed his hand and pulled him under the water.<br />
	<br />
As Eli walked down the halls to his office, he could not help but smile hearing all the comments that were whispered about him. But once in his office, Eli changed out of his button down shirt and pants, to put on some clothes he could work out in.<br />
	<br />
Stepping into the weight room, Eli went through a quick warm up, but just enough to to break a sweat, then he went over to the scale to check his weight. When he saw that he had gone up two pounds, his smile rivaled the sun. When he had hit 264 pounds, Eli had plateaued. But seeing that he had broken through, he made the rest of his first period work out that much more intensive. And he continued that trend at the football practice that afternoon. While he did not participate in all of the drills, Eli looked and acted more like a team captain that afternoon then the team’s coach. <br />
	<br />
The next day, after waking up with a twink he had picked up at a bar the previous night, Eli was sure that was glad to sign the divorce papers Ellenore had sent over a few days ago. <br />
	<br />
Fuck her. Eli thought. If she can’t see the amazing catch he was and didn’t like the changes he was going through, he was going to find a few other people who would. It did not matter if they were male or female. Since he was free, Eli figured he might as well experiment.<br />
	<br />
So when he checked his weight again the next morning to find that he had gone up to 268 pounds, Eli was more thrilled then shocked. Throughout the week, as Eli continued to gain two pounds of muscle a day, Eli also noticed that some more of his players were going through growth spurts of their own.<br />
	<br />
Kevin was bulking up, and like Tyler, Pete, and Gary, his added muscle was improving his game. With larger arms, Kevin was throwing harder, and the few times when Eli had Kevin practice being tackled by some of the smaller boys on the team, Kevin could not even be brought to the ground. Plus, with his increased leg strength, he was able to make some formerly difficult running plays work easily.<br />
	<br />
Then there was John and Luther. The first day of the week, Eli had seen them in the cafeteria with food trays piled high and seeming to be trying to eat everything in sight. While he had worried at first, Eli shrugged it off because after Pete’s transformation, he had seemed to cut down on his food intake, if only a little. At that Friday’s practice, Eli asked both boys how much they had gained and getting a response of about 35 pounds each, made sure to asked if it was fat or muscle. While Luther did have a little more padding then what Eli would have liked, he was still performing. John though, was developing a six pack that like Gary&#39;s bowed out, but was solid muscle. A large portion of the defensive line was a coach’s dream.<br />
	<br />
This was obvious not just from the major improvements they were making on the field, but also in the way that their clothes were clinging tighter to their bodies. Eli also noticed that both boys had grown taller. Before they had been about his own hight, but now they looked to be getting close to the six and a half feet mark.<br />
	<br />
However, the situation that both delighted and terrified Eli was Gary. Gary was growing again. On Thursday when Eli had everyone weighed and measured, to make sure that they did not need to gear, Gary had not only almost gained an additional twenty pounds, of which none was fat from the sight of his abs, but Gary had also grown over an inch. Eli knew that Gary would need new gear for the coming game. But the only football outfits that he could think of that would now fit the colossal kid was stuff made for those in the major leagues. Either way, Eli was going to make sure that Gary was out on that field.<br />
	<br />
The Monday of the second week, Eli found that he had gained four more pounds over the weekend. He realized that it was from all of the food that he was now craving, but looking at his eight pack abs, Eli knew that the weight was all muscle. His increased appetite was not just for food though. Every other night, Eli was bringing home either a boy or girl who were barely old enough to drink. Now at 27, Eli’s sex drive had returned, and then some.<br />
	<br />
This behavior continued until Wednesday after practice. Eli had been ordered by the administration to give the entire team a drug test, and being curious, Eli had also gotten himself tested, just to see if it really was something chemical.<br />
	<br />
When the test all came back clean, including his own, Eli made sure to place John, Luther, Gary, Tyler and Pete at the front of the line entering the football field. The looks on the faces of not only the opposing players, but also the coach of the opposing team was priceless. Gary, at the front, was now walking onto the field at almost 450 pounds of solid muscle while towering at seven feet of height. Right behind Gary, Luther and John strutted onto the field. With John at 357 pounds and standing at six feet and eight inches and Luther at 363 pounds and standing at six feet and five inches, John, Luther and Gary formed a wall that mowed over the offensive line. <br />
	<br />
After the three defenders, Kevin, Tyler and Pete walked out. Kevin had reach 231 pounds by that Friday night and had grown to a height of six feet and three inches from his former 5 feet and ten inches. While Pete and Tyler had not had the gains that the other four had undergone in the past two week, their own growth still left them closer to the size and weight of professionals then the high schoolers they truly were. <br />
	<br />
With all of the growth that the team was undergoing, Eli was a little jealous of the players sudden increase in height, but with his own muscle gains, Eli was able to console himself with the fact that he was at least twenty years too late to grow taller (at least as far as he knew, in fact is was only now less then ten years older then some of his players).<br />
	<br />
The game was even more of a blow out then the previous one, and when Gary got out of the locker room that night, Lucy was waiting for him. It was only about an hour later that Gary was emptying another load into her waiting hole. Having lost count of the number of times that he had filled her to the prim, even causing her pussy to overflow on a few occasions, Lucy was just basking in the after glow of filling herself with her man.<br />
	<br />
Running her hands through his chest hair or the thick beard that covered Gary’s face, Lucy jokingly said, “If you did not have brown hair, I would mistake you for some Norse god.”</p>
