<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Regina Talbot was mad. After arriving at home after her husband snapped and snarled at her; she was about the lash back at him for daring to speak his mind with her. But since her husband was Leon Talbot, the were-lion king, she had to bite her tongue; his brothers were there and he was speaking to them as a king and not as an older brother. But that still didn’t mean she wasn’t going to give him holy hell once he got home from the hospital; if he gets home.<br />
<br />
Leon’s son, Peter is currently recovering in the hospital after nearly dying from a gunshot wound to the abdomen. Being shot for his ‘66 mustang by a hoodlum that later turned out to be the son of a notorious mobster from San-Francisco; Leon was naturally feeling threatened what with someone in his territory and actively harming members of his family and pride. While his son the were-lion prince will pull through, Leon was taking no chances with the arrival of Frederick Parker.<br />
<br />
Freddie “the shark” as he know as in certain circles; the man arrived in town with the sole intention of getting his son out of jail. A normal person with the means to make most people suffer; the man has no clue that the residents of Moon Lake are were-beasts. Stronger, faster and more agile then a regular human; a few of Freddie’s men found that out the hard way when they broke into Benton Knight’s Estate. Those men are dead. Yet it was Regina who was currently feeling angry.<br />
<br />
Sitting in an empty house; her husband with their son at the hospital and her daughter Jean with her werewolf mate Nate Anderson. With only the television to keep her company, she turns it on flicking through the channels to see a small “W” flashing in the lower left hand corner. Everybody in Moon Lake knew what that “W” meant; they were under a were-alert. No is allowed to be in their fursona outside after dark; not just in the day.<br />
“No thanks to that mobster,” Regina growling as she tunes the television to the news.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
It was a few hours later when Regina wakes up. Having a small cat nap as she hears people entering her house; Regina was about to attack when her ears pick up that it was Jean and Nate. Calming down some as she leaves the living room to see them arriving; Regina gives her daughter a look that implies that her father is still at the hospital and is not likely to return for some time.<br />
“So are you two heading out again soon,” Regina looking at her daughter and fiancé/husband.<br />
“No mom,” Jean sitting down in a nearby chair; “Nate and I had enough excitement, what with what happened at the Knight Estate recently.<br />
“What happened,” Regina looking somewhat curious.”<br />
“Some of the men that this Parker fellow has,” Nate shaking his head; “decided to break into the Knight Estate. My brother Eric was over there with Spencer and Frieda, baby sitting some were-tiger cubs.”<br />
“Oh my,” Regina looking aghast; “what happened?”<br />
“From what we could overhear after arriving there,” Jean speaking; “three of the four men are dead.”<br />
“Eric had to kill one of them,” Nate shaking his head.<br />
“I’m sure Benton must be livid,” Regina shaking her head; “but why did he leave one alive and why did Eric kill one of them?”<br />
“Benton wasn’t home mom,” Jean responding; “Eric killed one of the men, because that man entered the room the were-tiger cubs were hiding in, and was armed with a crowbar.”<br />
“Well,” Regina shaking her head; “I wouldn’t want to be Freddie Parker right about now. Having to deal with Leon and now Benton? Dead man walking is all I have to say.”<br />
“I’m sure my father,” Nate looking grim; “will want a piece of the Parker’s as well.”<br />
“We are going to get a quick bite to eat before heading off to bed mom,” Jean speaking; leading Nate off to what will be a loud evening of howling and roaring.<br />
<br />
Regina smiles as she watches Jean drag Nate off; sighing for a moment, Regina picks up the house phone to call Leon. Getting his voicemail as she tries to contact his cellphone; Regina, half growling relays what Jean just told her and for her husband to get home right away. Hanging up, Regina is about to get up when the sounds of a bed creaking and a were-lioness and werewolf rutting could be heard.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
When Jean mentioned a bite to eat; she wasn’t referring to food. Dragging Nate all the way to her bedroom; removing her clothes and shifting into her were-lioness form. The tawny furred were-lion effortlessly tosses and already shifting brown furred werewolf onto her bed and pounces on him soon after. Like her mother, Jean couldn’t help herself in being aggressive when it comes to rutting. Wrestling to be on top; Jean was soon struggling with a werewolf with a raging hard on as he was determined to claim his mate like a wild animal would when mating.<br />
<br />
Even though it felt like it went on forever; Jean soon found herself pinned down on all fours as Nate was one top. The victor of the match, Nate give off a growl of victory as the tip of his lupine member kisses Jean’s sopping wet snatch. Inhaling her heady scent of arousal as he nips her ear; Nate parts Jean’s slit with his rocket and starts to rhythmically thrust in and out of her.<br />
<br />
For Jean, the feeling of being penetrated and probed as she was mounted was intense. Unable to move out from under her mate as he ruts her; she instinctively moves her hips, gyrating them in tune to Nate’s pounding. Determined to have his knot enveloped within her, she growls and yowls as her body lights up in pleasure. His touch, his presence, hell even Nate’s hot breath was putting Jean in a state of ecstasy; her eyes glazed over as her vision blurs, the sensation of sex too much for her as she closes her eyes. Preferring to enjoy through touch and smell.<br />
<br />
For Nate, the feeling of Jean’s slick tunnel clamping and eagerly milking his rod as he rapidly pushes it in and out was electric; his furry balls slapping Jean’s crotch as the sound of wet flesh rubbing against each other could be heard. Feeling his knot getting past the entrance and then being swallowed; Nate growled as he bites down on the nape of Jean’s neck. The urge to thrust even faster came upon him as he can feel his climax approaching rapidly; the pressure within him and Jean’s vaginal muscles clamping on him hard was too much for Nate to bear. With one final and powerful thrust; he lets go of Jean’s neck and howls in joy as he releases his seed into Jean’s eager womb.<br />
<br />
For Jean; the feeling of Nate’s knot stretching her, drove the were-lioness to the brink of unbridled passion. Filled and feeling complete; locked with her mate. Feeling Nate picking up the pace with his thrusting; Jean could feel that the moment was near as her own body started to tense and shudder. Feeling Nate’s member spasm and twitch inside her; caused Jean to explode in orgasmic joy. Releasing a deafening roar as Nate howls; feeling his seed shooting through her like a runaway freight train. Jean was glad she took her were-birth control pill earlier. With Nate still in high school and she attending Moon Lake College to become a lawyer; neither were ready to become parents right at the moment. Yet that didn’t stop them from making wild passionate love with each other.<br />
<br />
The two lovers still; enjoying the afterglow of their recent coupling, Nate shifts to allow Jean to lie down. Still knotted with in her; Nate spoons his were-lioness lover as Jean purrs. She can still feel Nate cumming in her; each twitch of his lupine rod causing her to gasp and sigh as he fills her to beyond capacity.<br />
“That’s it my husband,” Jean sighing; “give me every drop of your cream. I want it all.”<br />
“The way you are milking me,” Nate growling; “you’re going to get your wish.”<br />
“Oooooh,” Jean purring; “you make me feel full. Don’t you dare pull out of me. I want you still in me as I fall asleep;” Jean cooing as she takes Nate’s paws and places them on her abdomen.<br />
<br />
Nate just growls happily as he feels the last of his seed filling his mate’s eager womb. Rubbing her fur with his paws; he pleasantly strokes Jean’s belly as he slowly works his way up to her fur covered breasts. Cupping them and giving them a playful squeeze before readjusting to wrap his arms around her. Determined to keep her secured as they both drift off to sleep; each hope that Sunday will be a peaceful day.</p>
