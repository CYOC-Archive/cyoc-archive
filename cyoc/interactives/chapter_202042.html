<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doors to the hanger open and Jeff sees a man wearing a blue jumpsuit, ‘don’t tell me that that guy is about to give me a check-up,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I hope he won’t mess with my “computer”, I don’t want to lose myself.’<br />
<br />
The technician stop a few feet away and stares up at the plane, he scratches his head, “so, this is the plane that my boss discovered on the abandoned airfield,” he asks himself, “why would anyone dump a brand new plane? This is so weird, but maybe it has some issues, which the manufacturer did not want to repair, maybe it has some kind of non repairable issue. I guess I need to check it&#39;s system thoroughly, this is going to be a long and stressful day... maybe even week.”<br />
<br />
The computer guy, who’s name is Vincent, walks towards a mobile stair and drives it up to the “plane”, lining the top of the stairs to one of the doors. Jeff starts to panic, &#39;nononono... if he checks my computer... he&#39;ll find “human data”,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;he&#39;ll see it as a virus or something... b-but maybe he&#39;ll realize I am not a real plane,&#39; Jeff tries to think positive, he can still break character when he realizes if the computer-wiz starts to mess with his “computer” to much.<br />
<br />
Vincent walks up the stairs and opens the door, he steps inside and makes his way to the cockpit. He puts his equipment on the co-pilot’s seat and sits down on the pilot’s seat, he then opens a hatch right underneath the on-board-computer of the “plane”, “now, let’s see what we can find,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt weird as Vinni opened his door and stepped into his body, ‘having a human inside of me feels so weird,’ he thinks to himself, ‘it feels on one hand wrong, but on the other it feels right. A part of me knows that I am a human, the other part, the “plane” part, knows that it was made for humans. I feel so conflicted,’ the former human continues to think. When he feels Vincent opening the hatch below his computer, where the outlets to the “plane’s” blackbox and computer mainframe are located, Jeff again starts to panic, ‘please don’t…,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Vincent opens his bag and takes out his laptop and some cables, the man powers his laptop up and inserts the USB-ends of the cables into the slots on his laptop. Jeff then feels a stinging sensation in his mind as Vinni connect the other ends to his blackbox and mainframe.<br />
<br />
Feeling the connection to the programmer’s laptop, Jeff decides to break character, the on board speaker, which is connected to the on board communication system, gives of a white noise sound as it turns on. “Please, sir,” Jeff says, startling Vinni, “y-you are making a huge mistake, I am n-not a plane… I… I am a 16-year-old human called Jeff.”<br />
<br />
“What the freak,” Vinni says, “why did the radio turn on and why is this kid coming through? I think I now know the issue, better start the download and diagnostics, I hope I’ll find the malicious file,” the man the moves his mouse on to the “start download” button.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s fear grows, “NO DON’T,” he shouts over the speakers, “PLEASE, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME! I AM NOT A PLANE! I AM A HUMAN, I TRANSFORMED MYSELF INTO A PLANE,” he continues to shout, the tone in his voice sounding extremely desperate.<br />
<br />
Vinni grimaces, “yeah, right,” he says in disbelief, “as if something like that is possible, there is no way a human is able to transform into an object, let alone a plane. I really got to fix this issue, fast,” so he confirms the download.<br />
<br />
“NO… PL-PLEASE… Y-YOU MIGHT… HURT MEEEeeeee…,” was the last what Jeff is able to say before he feels his mind become blank.<br />
<br />
“Seems that downloading the plane’s data has disconnected the hacker’s interference,” Vincent says, “now I can find that malware and get rid of it, I now understand why the plane was dumped, I guess other computer guys were unable to find the source of the hack… but I will find it.”<br />
<br />
After the download is completed, Vincent opens the diagnostic program on his laptop and starts the process. A window with a message pops up, the message reads that the process would take two days, Vinni’s eyes widen when he reads this, “dang, that is a lot of data,” he says, “I better call Josh and ask for his input,” he takes out his phone and calls the CEO. Vinni explains the situation to his boss, Josh informs him to do it, that there is no rush, he’d rather have a thorough diagnostic than a half one. “Okay boss,” Vinni says, “but… I would be unable to continue my work, I have other projects running,” he says.<br />
<br />
“I understand Vinni,” Josh says on the other side of the call, “you have worked hard the last few days, so why don’t you take the rest of the day off and enjoy two full days with your family?”<br />
<br />
“Are you serious,” Vinni asks in disbelief, “I… I don’t know what to say… thanks.”<br />
<br />
Josh chuckles, “you deserved it, Vinni,” he says, “now, just leave your stuff in the plane, I’ll see to it that no one enters or works on the plane while you are still running the diagnosis.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good, thanks again,” Vinni replies, he then ends the call and after starting the diagnosis process leaves for home.<br />
<br />
Two days later, Vinni returns to the “plane” and checks on the diagnosis proceeding, he smiles when he sees that it’ll be completed in ten minutes. Once the process is completed, Vinni opens the downloaded file and does a first scroll through the sub-files, “man… there really is a lot,” he mutters to himself. He opens files, which include important data about the plane, like it’s make, when it has been manufactured, which company manufactured it, and other standard informations any plane should have. These informations of a standard plane were added by the Chronivac to Jeff’s human “data”, this of course is unknown to Vinni and anyone who is not involved in the transformation of Jeff, and since Jeff has not told anyone, no one in the world knows about his predicament. “Everything looks in order so far,” Vinni says, “I have not found any malicious program installed yet, but I won’t give up, it has to be here somewhere,” he continues to scroll through the files. After a while two files catch his attention, one is labeled “Chronivac” and the other is labeled “Jeff Backup”. Vinni had heard about the Chronivac, but he never believed the stories, now seeing the program installed on a plane brings up red flags in his mind, “I knew it… I knew that it was a hacking program,” he says to himself. Vinni opens the file and reads through the manual, “hm… it does say that it is able to transform people and objects, so what is it doing on a plane? Maybe someone reprogrammed it to be also a hacking program, I better get rid of it,” he says. The man does not hesitate to delete the Chronivac from the plane’s collection of files, unaware that he has just sealed Jeff’s fate: without being connected to the Chronivac, the former human will be unable to transform back into his normal self.<br />
<br />
Once the Chronivac is deleted, Jeff’s phone, which is now in the airport’s lost and found, gives of a chime and a message appears, which reads, “WARNING: Lost connection with subject! Unable to restore target to it’s original state!”<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Vinni had opened the file labeled “Jeff Backup”, his eyes narrow as he reads through the data. There is a name, address, age, information about some school, gender, sexuality and more. Vinni scratches his head, “what on earth? Maybe this is the information of the person who hacked the plane,” he asks himself, “better also delete it, I hope that solves the problem… and… done! Now, to upload the plane’s data back into it’s system.”<br />
<br />
Jeff feels himself slowly returning to his senses, but he feels that something is off, he feel confused and he can’t remember his old life. The former teen only knows that he is a plane, but he also feels that he shouldn’t be a plane, that he should be a… human? He feels so confused and decides to just relax, maybe he’ll find some answers soon.</p>
