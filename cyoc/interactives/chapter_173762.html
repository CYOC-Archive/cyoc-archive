<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen felt around at the ridge of her brow with one hand as she tried to line up where to press her eye into with the other.  Once she felt like she had the right spot more or less lined up, she touched the “back” of her eye to the featureless skin in the rough area that it should go.  She wasn’t sure what to expect, but nothing seemed to happen.<br />
<br />
<i>Do I have the right spot?</i> she wondered to herself.  Then again, she didn’t really think that this would work in the first place, so she didn’t really expect it to matter.  Just to say she tried before moving on to search for other solutions, she pressed her inanimate eye against her face a bit harder.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, she felt something give.  Her eye seemed to sink into place slightly and she felt a strange suction sensation underneath her eye.  She would have gasped if she was able. <br />
<br />
That feeling came from the eye she pressed into place, not the skin underneath it!  And now she was feeling the force of her hand still firmly pressing into her eyeball just to the point where it began to hurt.  Jen quickly moved her hand out of the way and opened her eye.<br />
<br />
She could see!  Something about her eye felt a little odd, but she couldn’t quite put her finger on what it was.  She chalked it up to the strange detachment and reattachment that it just went through and didn’t think much more on it, as there were more pressing matters.<br />
<br />
<i>This can be fixed!  It’s all going to be okay!</i> Jen thought to herself in relief.  She looked down at the other pieces of herself that she’d collected.  To her surprise, she quickly noticed that a couple eyebrows sat on the ground near her feet that she’d missed.  Luckily they landed close by or she might have missed them. She quickly added them to the collection she held.<br />
<br />
She took her other eye from the pile and examined it. It was much as she had surmised by touch.  The eye was closed and unmoving but still warm as if alive.  It only seemed to be a few millimeters thick, though she supposed she was thankful that it didn’t resemble a full eyeball.  It was a bit stranger to process like this, but less gross at least.<br />
<br />
She tried to pull the eyelid open, but it was held closed with at least some force.  Not wanting to risk pressing it too hard into her hand just in case it was possible to attach there, Jen didn’t try further.  That concern did bring up some interesting potential questions, but she wanted to make sure that she could fix herself fully before she even began considering experimenting further with anything weird.<br />
<br />
<i>I might as well get on with it then,</i> Jen thought, flipping the eye around and preparing to push it into place on the other side of her face.  It pressed into place just as easily as the first, calming her further.<br />
<br />
However, this time when she opened her eyes, the whole world lurched in front of her.  She immediately felt her stomach heave and squeezed her eyes shut, holding her free hand to her head.<br />
<br />
 <i>What the hell was that?!</i> she thought as she waited for the swimming in her head to subside.<br />
<br />
Carefully, she slowly tried to open her eyes again, but the moment things began to come into focus, her vision shifted and doubled again, bringing on a new wave of nausea.  Jen groaned and began thinking through what might be going on as she waited for the sick feeling to subside.  Suddenly, she realized something.<br />
<br />
Without opening her eyes, Jen put a hand over her right eye, then opened it.  She was greeted with the sight of kitchen tile.  She rubbed at the eye that she was covering, but she had the sensation that she was touching her left eye.  She began to suspect what might have gone wrong.<br />
<br />
With one eye still closed, Jen carefully stood up and placed her other still-dormant facial features on the counter and went to the bathroom to look in the mirror.  She mentally braced herself to expect something odd in the mirror, but the reflection that looked back at her was still unnerving.<br />
<br />
Aside from her face, everything was still the same.  Jen still had her comfy pajamas on, and her hair was a bit of a mess, but other than her eyes, her face was covered with completely smooth, unblemished skin.  She could have sworn she had a zit or two coming up on her chin before, but even those were gone.<br />
<br />
Her eyes were a bit of a pitiful sight, however.  She already knew that she’d accidentally reversed their orientation, but looking in the mirror, they weren’t even lined up well.  Both were obviously slightly out of place, and the left eye that she’s mistakenly put in the right socket seemed like it was at a slight angle.  It was no wonder that they didn’t seem to be working together right.<br />
<br />
Jen examined herself for a couple minutes in frustration trying to think of her next plan of action.  She may be able to adjust to this with time, but she didn’t really want to spend her Friday night dealing with nausea from her eyes adjusting to their new positions, and even if she got the other pieces perfectly in place, her eyes would still look a bit off.  One thing was obvious: she would probably need to re-use the transformation spray.  This time, she would be ready and keep track of which eye was which, and the second one would be done in front of the mirror.  That should solve most of the issues she was currently experiencing.<br />
<br />
With a plan of action in mind, Jen went back to the kitchen and found where she left the Salve of Transformation spray.  Once again, she spritzed her face, then she carefully held her head low over the counter while she waited for it to take effect...</p>
