<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke and Mark were the last ones to enter the class room, which made it easier for them to pick out a seat near the back away from everyone else.  They dropped their bag, pulled out their books, and sat down.  Luke's half of their body was leaning back in the seat with his leg stretched out, but Mark was trying to sit up with his foot under their chair.  It was really uncomfortable for both of them, and they tried to force the other one to move, hoping they weren't drawing attention.  Finally Mark gave in, and sat back with Luke.<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones, the math teacher, walked in and clapped his hands together, &quot;Good news everyone! I have a surprise test for you all today!&quot;  The whole class groaned, except for Mark, who smiled, and cheered to himself.  <br />
<br />
Luke however was close enough to hear, and looked at him, &quot;I forgot how much of you like this stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe if you studied a little more, you'd like it to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you? Spending and hour a night?&quot; Luke rolled his eyes and put his arm across their chest.  Luke suddenly turned to Mark with a smile. &quot;Wait, this means I can just copy you.&quot;  Mark looked back, unamused at the idea.  <br />
<br />
Mr. Jones was handing out the test as he walked up and down the rows.  &quot;Remember, no speaking, cell phones, ipods, or anything like that.&quot;  He sat down at his desk, and looked over to where Luke and Mark were sitting.  His eyes seemed to narrow in on Luke, &quot;And no cheating.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone was now writing the test, except for Luke.  When he glanced at Mark, he could see that Mark was already on the second page.  When Mark noticed Luke looking, he pulled his test father to the side.  Luke grumbled and whispered to Mark, &quot;How am I suppose to do this? I'm right handed for fuck sake!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just use your left hand.&quot; Mark hissed without looking over.  He felt Luke shove him, but let it slide.  Luke looked down at his test and was starting to get mad.  He didn't study like Mark, but that didn't mean he didn't know the answers, and without a hand to write with, he didn't see the difference.  Luke finally gave in and took one of the other pencils, and did his best to write.  He had gotten through the first page, and started the second when his pencil broke.  He gave Mark another nudge. Mark turned and whispered, &quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke held up the pencil, making Mark sigh.  Mark reached into their bag and pulled out a sharpener, and put it on the desk before going back to writing.  Luke sat for a moment.  He looked at the sharpener, then to Mark, then back down again.  He gave Mark another shove as he tried to sharpen his pencil with one hand.  Mark mumbled something to himself with an angry tone.  He had no choice but to help Luke.  &quot;Ya... this sucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!&quot; Mr. Jones was looking at them, &quot;No talking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to sharpen a pencil here Mr. Jones.&quot; Luke talked back, and Mark gave him a shove for it.  They each went back to their tests.  Luke looked at his scribbled numbers, then over at Mark's, who was pretty much already done.  He was staring at back and forth between the tests, and feeling like he should just give up.  That's when his glanced up and was Mr.Jones standing a foot away.  Luke sighed and rolled his eyes.  Mr.Jones took Luke's test away, and told them to wait outside after Mark had finished.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once Mark had finished, they got up and handed it in, then walked out into the hall.  Luke took over, and leaned against some lockers, letting themselves slide to the floor.  &quot;This isn't fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got caught cheating...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't cheating!&quot; Luke threw his arm in the air.  He found that tears were building up in his eyes, &quot;I was just really frustrated with how far ahead you were, and how shitty it seemed I was doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok Luke.&quot; Mark put his right arm around them to try and comfort his friend, &quot;I know you know how to do that stuff.  And you're right, it's not fair.  You get screwed over, just because you're on the left side?&quot;  Mark did his best to hug Luke, &quot;It's stupid anyways.  In this world, we're stuck together forever.  As long as one of us understands, isn't that good enough?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Jones had come out in time to here that last sentence, &quot;I can see why you think that way.  But you guys have always wanted to be treated as two different people.  So... that's how I've been treating you.  I wouldn't let any other two students cheat so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn't cheating!&quot; Luke repeated, and went a little red faced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. I believe you, just calm down.&quot;  Mr.Jones crouched down on one knee.  &quot;I can tell by looking at your paper that somethings... off.  I've never seen you write like that before.&quot;  He looked from one boy to the other, &quot;Is everything ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, we're ok.&quot; They said together.  Luke kept his head down, but Mark raised his, &quot;You're not gonna tell our parents are you?&quot;  Mr.Jones thought for a moment then shook his head.  &quot;Cool, thanks.&quot;  Mark and Luke lifted themselves off the floor, and dusted themselves off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll let it go.&quot;  Mr.Jones smiled, &quot;But I expect better next time ok?&quot;  Luke and Mark both nodded just as the bell rang.   They went back into the class and gathered up their things before heading off for their break between classes.</p>
