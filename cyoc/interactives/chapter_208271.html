<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To Paul Scott it seemed like all the lights in the mall went out the very moment the flipping coin landed. Darkness and an eerie silence embraced him with open arms.<br />
<br />
He suddenly shivered, his body fat shaking like jello. He felt very chilly, which he thought was strange considering the AC of the mall was always set too hot for his tastes. On the bright side he wasn’t sweating like a pig anymore.<br />
<br />
A lone lightbulb turned on above his balding head, and the fat man realized he wasn’t in the food court anymore. He was in a room devoid of any furniture, the walls decorated with tiles that used to be white. A strong scent filled the room that made Paul immediately think of a restroom. But what would the point of a restroom without toilets be, he thought.<br />
<br />
Paul looked at his left and was shocked at what he saw. He saw a man who had to be in his thirties, with a muscular and tanned body. He was standing with his hands down to his sides, his eyes looking at the wall in front of him with no sign of emotion at all.<br />
<br />
The man was completely naked.<br />
<br />
It was a very surprising sight for Paul and, blushing, he tried his best to avoid looking at the hunk’s impressively-endowed groin. But the surprises didn’t end there. There was a younger man to the left of this naked man. He seemed to be younger, in his early twenties. He wasn’t nearly as fit as the tanned hunk but his green eyes and youthful figure made him seem like taken straight out of a work of art.<br />
<br />
And like the youthful men featured in a lot of pieces of art, this man was also completely naked.<br />
<br />
Something was very perplexing about Paul’s situation. He had found himself teleported into this bare room in the company of these two men in the buff who did nothing but stand still. The lack of any sort of expression in the handsome faces of these exhibitionists made them look very imposing.<br />
<br />
He could’ve asked these two men if they knew what was going on. But Paul couldn’t quite come up with the right words. These perfectly manscaped men were nude. And they were eagerly showing off their impressive equipment without even flinching. For Paul and his sweaty beergut to approach these prime examples of what true athletes should look like would be... awkward.<br />
<br />
That’s why Paul always avoided gyms and locker rooms in general. The comparisons he made in his head never turned out in his favor.<br />
<br />
An inconspicuous door on the left side of the room suddenly opened with a loud bang. Paul froze up, fearing people would find him next to the naked men and get the wrong idea.<br />
<br />
“...And in this room we keep the display models.” A salesman said to his prospective buyer. “They are brand new of course. They’ve just been exhibited for a long time so you can get them at preowned prices! They’re a steal!”<br />
<br />
The customer was dressed with a leather jacket and boots. His name was Jack and despite his biker-like looks he was actually more of a jogger kind of guy.  “It’s true that I’m on a budget. But I really need a large one, one that can take anything I throw at it.”<br />
<br />
The salesman, a man dressed in a very sharp suit and with a very unremarkable face named Francis, smiled. “Yes, of course. ” However when the salesman saw the three men standing in the room he suddenly looked a bit pissed. “Crap, the intern once again left the display models in their bipedal setting. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.”<br />
<br />
Jack approached the youngest naked man in the room. “You don’t have to apologize, this way I can admire the design of their bipedal forms as well.” He caressed the smooth curves on the ass of the youthful-looking nudist as he said this.<br />
<br />
To Paul’s surprise, the green-eyed nude man didn’t even flinch at the touch. He just let himself be shamelessly touched by the customer as much as he wanted. The spectacle became even more obscene when Jack grabbed the young man’s cock, squeezed it hard and moved it swiftly in precise directions not unlike he was inputting some kind of code.<br />
<br />
“You sure know the way to handle their thingies.” Francis the salesman complimented.<br />
<br />
“Believe me, I’m an expert at using the handles on these things.” Jack laughed. “Let’s see what display model number 1 looks like in its real form.”<br />
<br />
For the first time, the naked man with green eyes seemed to react. He silently laid down on his knees. He opened his mouth and his jaw impossibly increased in size until it looked like a big round bowl made of human flesh. His lower lips became the toilet seat and his upper lips became the lid. And this bowl seemed as heavy if not more than the one on a porcelain toilet. The young man instinctively held the heavy bowl that was now part of his head with his arms and his whole body hardened with the only finality of supporting his big bowl-mouth. As if to add more humiliation to the toilet man&#39;s surreal appearance his buttcheeks were permanently spread open, his anus in plain sight slightly pulsing as if pleading to be plugged out of its misery.<br />
<br />
Paul had thought that this green-eyed man had looked like a fine piece of art, but right now he looked like a disproportionate sculpture of himself fused with a toilet bowl. A strange mishmash made up of male human flesh and the shape of a toilet was now sitting where the man was. It was a horrifying sight for Paul, but Jack acted like it was an everyday sight.<br />
<br />
Jack observed the grotesque figure in front of him from all angles and after evaluating it he shook his head with disapproval. “No, this one is too small and puny for my taste. I want a toilet that can be used all night with no need to empty its tank every five minutes. The parties I make with my friends can get really nasty and this weakling won’t cut it.” He kicked the young man’s nuts spitefully and the weretoilet once again reverted to its human appearance as a result.<br />
<br />
“So display model number 1 is a no, then.” The salesman said. “That’s alright, I’m sure you’ll like the next one.”<br />
<br />
Paul was in shock. Not only had the man been momentarily turned into a toilet, he had been treated with as much respect as one. Paul thought he had to be in some kind of nightmare, everything that was unfolding seemed all so unreal to him.<br />
<br />
As Paul tried to find an explanation Jack and the toilet salesman had already walked to the next naked man, the one with tanned skin and a muscular frame.<br />
<br />
“Looks promising enough.” Jack said as he once again grabbed another guy’s cock without any warning or permission. He began jerking the tanned man’s anaconda with expertise.<br />
<br />
The muscular tanned man didn’t seem to welcome the touch but stayed silent. He seemed like he could easily take down Jack in a one-to-one brawl if he tried, but he didn&#39;t protest at all as he was unceremoniously manhandled.<br />
“(Why? Why doesn’t he break free?)” Paul wondered. Were these naked men some sort of robots without free will? But they look like flesh and blood, he thought.<br />
<br />
As Jack finished inputting the direction on the tanned man’s cock, he went through a similarly nightmarish transformation like display model number 1’s but the end result was a much heavier and bulkier toilet-man. Not only did the fit and heavyweight model 2 look much more sturdy and resistant than model 1, the darker finish on its body gave it a much more professional look.<br />
<br />
“Just look at its six-pack! It’ll be able to hold a lot of waste in that hard gut of its!” The salesman said in an excited tone. &quot;And have you checked out how wide open its buttcheeks are? Easy access to his drain hole!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Can I test its performance?” Jack asked and the salesman nodded.<br />
<br />
“Of course you can, it&#39;s a display model for a reason!”<br />
<br />
Jack unzipped his fly, took out his big veiny cock and inserted it between the human toilet’s meaty “lips”. He let the toilet savor his cock for a greatly generous amount of time until he relaxed and let his bladder go, the warm piss going down the toilet’s throat.<br />
<br />
The big toilet bowl certainly looked heavy and hard for the tanned man to hold but in the end he was still a toilet made of soft human flesh and his warm lips got to work diligently on Jack’s cock in order to squeeze the last few drops of urine out.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re free to cum inside too.” The salesman suggested, always overly eager to watch.<br />
<br />
“That would be great, but I have to leave something for display model number 3...” Jack looked at Paul with a grin.<br />
<br />
That’s when Paul woke up from his reverie. He had been detached from reality all this time, watching the impossibly strange show in front of him in complete silence with his mouth agape as if he was merely an spectator that didn’t belong there. Oh, how wrong he was.<br />
<br />
“Huh... Number 3...? But there’s no more naked guys in here.” He murmured to himself. Then Paul finally looked down and realized it. He was stark bullock naked...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul Scott was ready to receive all sorts of waste and bodily fluids now that he stood as display model number 3 in a line of toilets that resembled men. His wish of being able to get free stuff from people had been generously granted, whether he wanted it or not.</p>
