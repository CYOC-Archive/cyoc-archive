<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I’ve had this idea lingering in the back of my mind for a while now, and I’m super excited to turn it into a story! I’ll be creating a “main story”, but I’m really excited to see what others will to contribute </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">OFF LIMITS! STAY OUT!<br />
<br />
You look at the sign that hung on the chainlink fence that barred people from entering the forest. The fence was put up many years ago in order to prevent hunters and trappers from going too deep into the woods and hunting game out of season...or at least, that’s what the town council had said when they built it. <br />
<br />
Many people in your town believed that the fence was built because something more sinister was happening in the woods. Since the town’s founding in the late 1850s, there have been numerous disappearances of people who had wandered a little too far into the woods, which led to many theories and rumors as to what is actually happening. Some people say that a coven of witches perform their rituals, while others believe that there’s a secret government testing facility. But there’s one thing that everyone in town knows: if you go into the forest, you’ll never be seen again. <br />
<br />
You scoff and roll your eyes at the thought of something supernatural occurring in the forest. There was no such thing as ghosts, witches, or anything of that sort, and the rumors about going into the forest and never being seen again was just the older generation’s way of making sure that the kids in town didn’t wander too far from home. And if you did somehow manage to get lost, you can always use the GPS on your phone. Besides, the town’s butcher pays you quite well for every deer your bring in to him. With your hunting rifle strapped to your back, you begin to climb up the fence, hoisting yourself over the top and dropping on the other side before making your way into the vast sea of trees. <br />
<br />
Within a few minutes of entering the forest, you notice how quiet it is compared to the other areas you’ve gone hunting in. You expected to at least hear one or two birds chirping, but it was dead silent. You’re starting to feel rather unnerved when suddenly, you hear a rustling sound somewhere around you. You feel your heartbeat begin to quicken as you reach for your rifle and hold it close. Then, the sound of a large stick breaking echos through the forest, causing you to fearfully begin looking around for the source of the noise. You begin to debate whether or not you should turn around and go home when you are suddenly hit forcefully on the back of your head, causing you to fall to the ground. The last thing you see before losing consciousness is a rather large figure walking towards you. <br />
<br />
~     ~     ~<br />
<br />
When you come to, you slowly open your eyes and clutch the back of your head with your hand, gently rubbing it in an attempt to soothe the pain. As you do, you begin to look around. <br />
<br />
You are in a dimly lit room that appears to be made out of stone bricks. The only source of light is a small window that has iron bars in front of it. It becomes obvious that you are in a dungeon cell of some kind. You look down at yourself and see that you have been stripped of all your clothes, save for a rather dirty looking loincloth that is now covering your genitalia. A tight feeling around your neck brings your attention to what you quickly realize is a collar. Just what exactly have you gotten yourself into?<br />
<br />
Before you can ask any more questions, a loud creaking noise gets your attention. Turning your head, you notice that the door to the cell has been opened! A wave of relief washed over you as you get up off the ground, ready to run out of the cell when a large figure appears in the doorway and blocks your path, making you stop dead in your tracks. <br />
<br />
Standing in the doorway was a large, muscular, anthropomorphic lion. It wore an iron helmet on its head, as well as an iron breastplate that covered his upper chest, leaving his extremely well-defined core exposed for all to see. <br />
<br />
“Hey you, you’re finally awake,” the lion says in a rather masculine voice. “Good to see that the hunters didn’t hit you too hard and accidentally kill you. It would’ve been a shame if we had lost a potential profit. He proceeds to let out a rather hearty laugh, causing you to shrink back slightly in fear. <br />
<br />
“H-Hunters?!” You stammer, finally finding your voice. “P-Profit?! What the hell are you talking about?! Where am I?!” The lion sighs in frustration, shutting the cell door behind him before beginning to approach you.<br />
<br />
“God, you humans always have so many questions,” he says, shaking his head. “You’re in the Hidden City of Pedda, a city of animals who have evolved over centuries to walk, talk, act, and think like humans. We’ve stayed hidden from your kind for thousands of years thanks to the protective barrier that masks our city from prying eyes. Of course, we do get the occasional person who wanders into the forest surrounding our city and get a little too close for our liking. That’s why the city’s hunters patrol the borders and capture anyone who enters the forest.”<br />
<br />
“B-But...what about the profit part?” you ask. <br />
<br />
“Well, if you must know,” the lion begins, “Our evolutionary gift comes with the benefit of a greatly enhanced sex drive. Because of this, many of us animals desire something, or someone, to help satisfy these desires.” The lion grabs what looks to be a coil of chains from his waist and unwinds it, revealing it to be a leash. As terrified as you are, you don’t move a muscle as the lion clips the leash to the collar around your neck. <br />
<br />
“So as a way to benefit everyone in the city,” the lion continues, “We sell off any humans that we capture as sex slaves. And lucky for you, you don’t have to wait long to go on auction.” <br />
<br />
Your eyes widen in horror as the lion begins to lead you out of your cell. You don’t even think about resisting, as the lion would be able to swiftly overpower you. The only thing to do is to follow the lion.<br />
<br />
The lion leads you out of your cell and down a long, stone hallway that is illuminated by torches that are mounted on the wall. As you walk past numerous other cells, you notice that each one has an occupant. There’s no way that all of those people are from your hometown, so you begin to wonder if these animals are somehow taking people from all over the world. <br />
<br />
The lion stops in front of a door at the end of the hallway. From the other side, you can hear what sounds like a large crowd of people. Looking through the iron bars on the door, you can see another male human like you being held on a leash by an anthropomorphic bear. To his right was an anthropomorphic fox standing at a podium with a small gavel in his furry hand. In front of the stage, you can make out part of what looks to be the large crowd you heard. <br />
<br />
“500 Gold pieces going once….twice….sold to the snow leopard in the front!” the fox exclaimed. “Come up here and take your new slave home!” You watch as an anthropomorphic snow leopard walks onto the stage and hands a small sack of money to the fox before taking the human’s leash from the bear. With a sly grin, the snow leopard gropes the human’s ass, causing the young male to moan in embarrassment before he is led off the stage. <br />
<br />
As the snow leopard leaves with his prize, the bear walks towards the door and opens it for the lion, who nods to the bear before leading you onto the stage. <br />
<br />
“Ah, we’ve got another young one folks!” the auctioneer fox says as he sees you walk onto the stage. “Male, 18-24 years old, and rather well built! And how is he equipped?” The lion reaches to lift up your loincloth, but you quickly put your hands in front of it. <br />
<br />
“Oh ho ho! A shy one!” the fox says enthusiastically. “Looks like whoever buys this one will have a lot of fun breaking him! Now let the bidding...BEGIN!”</p>
