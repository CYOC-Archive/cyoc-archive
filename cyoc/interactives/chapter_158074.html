<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It only took a few more seconds for the change to become obvious - the boy was getting older!  A growth spurt shot him up as he went from 11 to 12, then 13.  The sound of his unration got louder as the stream got harder.  The now tween frowned at Carter.  &quot;Look, I know we&#39;re supposed to be digging latrines in the woods.  It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a bunch of kids waiting in line here.&quot; He was 14 now, thin and gangly, with a scattering of acne and a first dusting of a mustache.  <br />
<br />
The purple light was bright on top of the kid&#39;s head, but he was oblivious to it.  Carter couldn&#39;t find words to speak, unable to do more than stare as the teenager continued to age.  A faint soul patch emerged from the boy&#39;s chin as he became 15, then 16.  Carter blinked, realizing that the kid&#39;s uniform was changing to match his age.  It was now a Boy Scout uniform fitted to his changing body.  His frown changed to a scowl as the volume of piss increased from what be a much larger penis, but his displeasure was obviously with Carter.  &quot;Look, kid.  I just had to take a whiz.&quot;  He finished and zipped up, the aging apparently stopped at about 17.  &quot;I&#39;m going back to camp.  Keep your trap shut, OK?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;But..&quot;  Carter finally found his tongue, only to jump at an odd sensation around his bottom.  The Underoos he had been wearing were suddenly training pants - obviously used training pants.  The teenager grinned.  &quot;You don&#39;t tell, I won&#39;t tell.&quot;  Then he left.<br />
<br />
Carter started down at the soggy trainers, and then up at the purple glow that had remained behind.  It was not an insect - he could clearly make out a tiny human figure, like a boy with wings but just inches tall. [I&#39;m surprised you know what tell.  Last night&#39;s sloppy work. I bet.]<br />
<br />
&quot;What..  what are you?&quot;  Carter was terrified, unable to move.  &quot;Please, I won&#39;t say anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
[Should I make you forget how to talk?]  The training pants changed to an equally wet diaper, and Carter sat down suddenly as his body shrank to a toddler&#39;s.  [Or maybe that diaper should just be really full.]  Carter&#39;s legs lost feeling as they darkened into what looked and smelled like crap.  He cried out in horror as his arms dropped and the pudgy baby body sagged into the diaper as even more poop, the numbness rapidly moving up toward his head. There was a taste of shit in his mouth, and then his nose sank into the massive pile.  And then he was the 5 year-old boy again. Carter lay on the floor, panting in fear. <br />
<br />
[Just remember that is a possibility, human.] The glowing figure drifted down to hover in front of Carter.  [Or maybe this?]  Carter&#39;s toes detached themselves as they turned into large roaches that scurried across the floor. [I think you might produce several thousand insects.]  New digits appeared, but Carter still trembled in terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;P..p..please.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The floating figure moved closer, his features now showing puzzlement.  [You can still remember, can&#39;t you?  Oberon&#39;s Beard! The interruption last night.  All reality is changed, but you are still the man inside, at least partly.]<br />
<br />
Too frightened to speak again, Carter simply nodded his head.  <br />
<br />
[A complication.  But this could be interesting.]<br />
<br />
Carter felt a strange pressure in his head and then had a curious vision of something like merry-go-round made of living animals, and candy. There was a sensation of happiness.  It was not something from the glowing figure, somewhat shadowy and confused.  More like a...  dream?  That was it -  he was in a dream..  and then he knew.  It was Lucas&#39; dream.  <br />
<br />
[Yes.  I have connected you even more deeply to your new brother.  I cannot remove your adult memories, but the child will be so dominant that you will not be able to think or act any different than your twin.]  <br />
<br />
Carter&#39;s thumb drifted up to his mouth, and he had to resist the urge to suck it.  The dream faded, but now the other boy&#39;s thoughts and memories floated though his mind.  <br />
<br />
He heard other voices - a couple of the adult leaders were coming into the latrine!  <br />
<br />
[Tell them if you want to.  Of course, no telling what they will end up turned into.  More little boys?  A mated pair of skunks?] The figure flitted back up to the ceiling as the two men entered.  Carter recognized Sam Doscher and Eric Fee, two of the Webelos leaders.   They stopped as soon as they saw Carter still sitting on the floor.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You OK, little guy?&quot;  Doscher squatted down, looking concerned.  <br />
<br />
Carter glanced up, still unsure of what to do.  &quot;I&#39;m not...  I mean, I was bigger..&quot;  The glow near the ceiling brightened, and Doscher&#39;s two-day beard vanished and his uniform changed from that of an adult leader to a scout.  Now an older teenager, Doscher&#39;s expression never changed, and the man behind him said &quot;Maybe you take him back to his cabin, Sam.&quot;  The teen grinned and picked Carter up, hefting him easily.  &quot;OK, Dad.  meet you back at the camp.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time Carter just nodded.  He let the new teen carry him back, only pointing to indicate which cabin was his.  He mumbled a thank you and slipped back inside.  As soon as he saw Lucas, the memories and thoughts got stronger.  He went back to his sleeping back and got in, aware that he was almost touching his twin, Carter.  No!  He was Carter!<br />
<br />
Fatigue was catching up, and he was falling asleep despite his best efforts.  His left hand moved of its own accord to take his brother&#39;s free hand, and the right slid over his chest until the thumb was in his mouth.  Carter was aware of the actions, but could not counteract them.  Contact strengthened the link between them, and Lucas&#39; thoughts and dreams settled deeper.  He could fight sleep no longer and finally gave in.</p>
