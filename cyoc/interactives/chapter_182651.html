<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg jolted in surprise when Ethan&#39;s hand landed on his crotch. Ethan was surprised himself, he hadn&#39;t meant to do it. He just sort of reached out automatically. It was like a reflex in his horny brain that he couldn&#39;t stop. Maybe it was female hormones or something, he didn&#39;t know for sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what are you doing?&quot; Greg whispered. He was staring at Ethan in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t help it!&quot; Ethan whispered back furiously. &quot;Haylee&#39;s pussy is overheating. It&#39;s making me super horny!&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg just kept staring, but he didn&#39;t move the hand away, so Ethan pulled down Greg&#39;s swim shorts and then his own too. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unless you&#39;re objecting ... &quot; Ethan said.<br />
<br />
His friend only stopped him for a second with a hand on the arm, then Greg let go and sat back. Ethan stared at his brother&#39;s stiff little cock between Greg&#39;s thighs. Even though it was short and thin and youthful, it was still making him wet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just do it. &quot; He told Greg, determined. &quot;You&#39;ve hit this before anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, when it was on a girl!&quot; Greg protested, but he didn&#39;t sound convinced by his own weak denial. &quot;We&#39;re friends ... but you aren&#39;t a chick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, come on!&quot; Ethan was aggressively persuasive. &quot;Are you scared it means you&#39;re gay or something? Pussy is pussy! Besides, it&#39;s ME that&#39;s like this, because YOU begged to get a dick back! No one will know but us! I need to make this thing calm down!&quot;<br />
<br />
He stroked his hand up and down the tiny penis, and Ethan saw Greg&#39;s resistance crumble. His hand on the sensitive little organ was enough to change his friend&#39;s mind. Greg gave in, and Ethan climbed awkwardly onto him, straddling Greg&#39;s thighs. Lining himself up, he pushed forward and felt the small head press against his lips and then the shaft slid into his wet vagina with ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck,&quot; Ethan groaned.<br />
<br />
Greg grunted back, and grabbed Ethan&#39;s ass, pulling them close together. On instinct, Ethan began to move his hips, and the muscles of his vagina gripped and squeezed Greg&#39;s little member. The size wasn&#39;t a help, but Greg remembered enough of his time with Haylee to use that experience to make up for being a lot smaller, and he started to match Ethan&#39;s movements. His arms went around his friend&#39;s shoulders for balance, while Greg kept a hold of their hips, and before long, they were slowly fucking away. The rhythm felt great, and the repetitive sliding of a hard little cock into his pussy was starting to hit all the right spots on the way.<br />
<br />
It was feeling very very nice.<br />
<br />
Ethan was so horny that he began to forget that he was fucking his younger brother&#39;s dick, and that more importantly, he was having sex as a girl. He was beginning to moan out loud, a heat building up in his crotch, when Greg gasped out: &quot;It&#39;s so sensitive! I can&#39;t do this- ... not much more!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little longer! A little!&quot; Ethan called, and then in a couple more thrusts he was groaning, flooded with pleasure, as he got off. His vagina squeezed around the little cock and Greg was gasping as it spasmed, his tiny balls producing a couple of squirts of cum. Ethan shuddered and sighed, experiencing a female orgasm for the first time, and after a few seconds he slid off his friend&#39;s lap.<br />
<br />
As soon as he caught his breath, Greg was fetching a towel so they could wipe down.<br />
<br />
Ethan was calming down too, the lust dying away, but he didn&#39;t feel as embarrassed as he expected to.<br />
<br />
It was weird, but the spontaneous sex had actually been ... kinda fun?<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, dude,&quot; Greg stated, sitting back down and wiping his boyish crotch and pulling up his shorts, before he handed the towel to Ethan. &quot;That was kinda wild. Didn&#39;t think I would see her pussy again when I have a cock so ... undeveloped. No offence to your bro or anything, I know he&#39;s a lot younger than us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Sorry, it was just like this itch that wouldn&#39;t go away.&quot; Ethan cleaned himself up too and pulled up his own shorts. &quot;Let&#39;s not tell him about this though, it would probably weird him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg gave a snort. &quot;Why would I tell anyone? It&#39;s really freaky that we just had sex, though ... like ... guy-girl sex, as two guys. It was fucking weird, but ... &quot; he paused, like he was about to make a confession, &quot; ... actually kinda fun. Truthfully, I think you&#39;re dealing with having a pussy far better than me. I can&#39;t wait to get my junk back from Haylee on Monday.&quot; He patted Ethan on the shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, man. We&#39;re cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Ethan smiled. Greg was a bit of a dork, but overall still a cool guy. The post-sex atmosphere wasn&#39;t as awkward as it might have been.<br />
<br />
Now, he was still kinda looking forward to getting his original penis back, but there was fresh doubt. As embarrassing as it was, having a little dick had been enjoyable in a very strange way. Did he want to throw away those new experiences yet? And having a vagina had been more educational than he expected -- he didn&#39;t want to BE a girl, but the sex?<br />
<br />
Unexpectedly interesting.<br />
<br />
Maybe it could be interesting to play around with it some more?</p>
