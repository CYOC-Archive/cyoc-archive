<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His lips felt so soft and warm. As he slowly parted them he pushed mine apart too. Placing his hands just above my hips I felt him take control, even bent down from his height to reach my lips. I melted into him, into his powerful physique, as I felt his strength lead me. Slowly I felt the soft velvet touch of his tongue inside my lips, then he played with the tip of my own, much smaller tongue. His hands wandered lower and he gripped my wide hips, pulling me closer. My own hands wondered onto his hard stomach, gripping the folds in his shirt and caressing his taught muscles beneath. My hands felt so small, almost dainty im comparison to his size. <br />
<br />
His kiss became more passionate as our tongues entertwined. Pulling my waist close into him I raised my hands to his chest, and massaged his firm pecs. Finally, I had my hands on them, and they didn't disappoint, being as toned and as firm as steel. My body slowly flopped and I felt that tingling again between my legs. As he pulled me into him, I felt movement around his waist. Something was bulging into me around my midriff - I could guess what it was that was pressing into my soft flesh through my dress. We began to grind our groins together and I moved my arms around his own bulky frame to behind his back to pull him closer. I felt void within myself and wanted to be so close to him to feel whole. I caressed his firm arse and hooked my fingers into the belt of his trousers.<br />
<br />
Then what felt like an electric pulse coursed through me. Sean had placed his hand on my breast and I let out an involuntary moan as he massaged it through my school dress and my bra. How far was this from Mark's room?<br />
<br />
Pulling away from me, he said &quot;Are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
How sweet, I thought. &quot;Wow&quot; was all I could manage to say. &quot;I sure am.&quot; <br />
<br />
He pulled back further, against my much weaker arms as they tried to pull his waist back towards my small frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I think you're so cool. Please, don't stop.&quot; I sounded like such a whiny love-sick school girl!<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, doll,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm just thinking of better ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the same time, I realised I could see the lust clearly in his eyes. He wanted me. Bad. Thinking about my frame, my pert ass and those tits between us I couldn't really blame him.<br />
<br />
Gently tugging on my arm, he pulled me into an empty classroom just up from the locker room. I loved the feeling of having my thin arm fully enveloped by his large tanned grip. My eyes widened as he locked the door and smiled that winning grin at me again. His lips were so gorgeous. I didn't know what I was doing but I was just overcome by how excited he made me feel, how much I wanted him to hold me close and how much I wanted him.  <br />
<br />
He whispered seductively as he strode closer to me, already undoing his shirt as he said so, &quot;I thought that you might like to try this out as well.&quot; He cupped the now massive package in his trousers.<br />
<br />
I just stared at him, thrilled and fascinated by the hungry look in those sparkling deep eyes. &quot;I must be imagining things.&quot; He said quietly. &quot;I can't believe I'm getting so turned on by a new girl. But you're just so...gorgeous.&quot; He ran his hands over the curves of my hips and kissed me again, firmly, deeply and passionately as those strong arms embraced me. I loved the feeling of his bulging arm muscles clamp around me and pull me into that rock hard chest. I loved the hint of his smooth, tanned skin through his open shirt. I loved the way it felt so warm and inviting as I ran my small hands over it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're wonderful,&quot; was all I could manage.<br />
<br />
He pulled back and just smiled at that, slowly stripping and dropping his uniform to the floor.  &quot;Relax and enjoy it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then I don't know what came over me. As he stood there, only wearing clinging gray Abercrombie boxer-briefs. I slowly and sensually performed a striptease before his eyes, slipping my dress over my shoulders, letting it slip to the floor, revealing the full length of those great legs which I now felt were mine. Then I slipped out of my issue bra and knickers, giving a little shuffle of my hips. As I finished off, grinning to myself at the look of absolute lust which had ridden over his face I stood in front of him in as sexy a pose as I could muster, having been Roger just a few hours before.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me...you will,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
After this, Sean didn't say anything more. Within minutes of kissing and massaging each others toned bodies as we clung tight to each other we were on the teachers desk. <br />
<br />
Once I was completely naked, I was nearly in heaven.  &quot;God I'm sexy.&quot; I whispered to myself, posing even more and getting even more turned on. My nipples were so hard that they poked right out, feeling so intense when Sean, I or his great pecs rubbed against or touched them. And my crotch....  My new slit was so wet that it was dripping down my thigh.  &quot;Holy shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn't take me long before Sean was licking, sucking and rubbing at my nipples. I absolutely loved the sensations that they provided.  They were so much like what I normally had when turned on, but completely different as well. It was like my whole body was wired up to my cock. Every touch or caress from Sean sent a buzz throughout my body and brain. Absent-mindedly my hand dropped down to my crotch to play with myself as we writhed tightly together on the desk. We were like animals. I felt even better and better. Then Sean's hand joined mine in my crotch and he, forcing my own little hand in his own larger one, started working at my clitoris even harder and with a rythmn which sent me crazy. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes his legs forced mine wide and I let out a yelp as I felt his own manhood press between them. Glancing down I saw he had as massive a cock as I'd guessed in the pool. I ran my hands over and around his powerful thighs, massaging them and teasing him by holding him back from my sex. Then I raised my hands up to his balls and finally his erection. It felt so odd to be handling a man's parts on another body which was not my own, even with Enrique, he'd been doing all the leading and the body I was in had done all the running. This really felt like my body, and it was gripping his cock. It also felt...how can I put it...liberating. His erection was massive, and my small hands made it seem even bigger. I could barely get my hand around its girth and I began to worry it would be too big for me. Sean kissed me hard and guided himself into me. It was as if someone had fired a starting pistol. We went at it like animals. The feeling of Sean inside me pushed me to the brink. As he entered and re-rentered me it was as if he was pushing me towards some heavenly fire. I just lay back and ran my hands over his beautiful body. It was as if having him inside me made me whole.<br />
<br />
This was better than even Enrique inside me. I felt far too good to even seriously consider stopping. The feel of the muscles all around Sean's body, gripping his firm butt, fondling his powerful arm muscles and running my hands through his sandly locks of hair just added to the sensation of him dominating me. Enrique had been lust, but the connection, desire and need I felt for Sean was something deeper, and it touched me so much more. Our tongues sent each other into bliss as he penetrated deep inside me again and again. I wanted to be possessed and he took me, filling me with his manhood and making me long for him more and more. He found time to gently lick my nipples with his tongue, caressing my breasts and fondling them. Sometimes he gripped my waist, his large strong hands guiding me and controlling my wide hips. Still they felt too wide, still they felt slightly odd, but his touch felt so right. I held his body tight to mine, and honoured his athletic tight curves with my small, soft hands. I longed for him to be in me and dominate me - we gave each other such pleasure, I could see it deep within his dreamy brown eyes when I ran my small fingers over his firm jaw and cheekbones.<br />
<br />
It was so good that I moaned aloud as we writhed on the teachers' desk, finally coming in a massive orgasm . It seemed to explode throughout my entire body rather than just from my crotch. And even better, I was able to keep at it, grinding into his increasingly more flaccid member, forcing the hulk and muscle of his body inside and against me until I came again.<br />
<br />
Sean just grinned back.  &quot;Awesome.&quot; he told me.  &quot;But really different.&quot;  I nodded, knowing exactly what he meant. I giggled slightly and rubbed my nipples for a minute before going back to getting dressed. &quot;Damn.&quot; Sean whispered almost to himself.  I just continued to grin as I finished getting dressed and then strolled out of the classroom as sexily as I could.</p>
