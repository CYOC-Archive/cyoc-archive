<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty mused.  &quot;Go Fish could get pretty interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so,&quot; said Dustin.  &quot;I really don't know what a pack of cards has to do with my weird-ass growth spurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What growth spurt?&quot; Ty said, wishing that all of Dustin's growth would go back into June's solitaire deck, even the spurt over the next few years.  At once, Dustin shrank down to his underdeveloped thirteen-year-old self, even though he was still a year older than the fifteen-year-old Ty.  His clothes were still shredded, however.<br />
<br />
Ty thought more.  Go Fish wouldn't be as interesting as poker.  &quot;Here's the deal.  We're going to play three hands of five-card stud.  Winner of each hand gains the values of his cards like before.  Loser doesn't get anything.  And that's what we get for puberty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin rubbed his chin.  &quot;One of us is likely to get more than the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;Yep, but that's what makes it interesting.  And jokers will be wild, counting as anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And aces are now fourteens, with the face cards eleven through thirteen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; said Ty.  &quot;But you might want to lose a hand if you've got clubs, unless you want to be a hairball.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Dustin said.  &quot;Better than looking like a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty dealt, then picked up his cards.  King of Hearts, King of Spades, and a two, a seven, and a nine, all hearts.  That was a lot of muscle for him, but nothing in height, and not a great hand to win.  Close to a flush if he wanted nothing but muscle though.<br />
<br />
He thought.  This was more interesting, certainly.  Definitely keep the Kings, and though he usually wouldn't with poker, the nine as well.  He set aside the two and the seven, face down, while Dustin looked at his cards and set aside two as well.<br />
<br />
Ty dealt two to him and two to himself.  Ty looked.  He'd gotten the two of spades and the three of clubs--a couple inches more dick and little bit more hair.  This wasn't bad, even though he wouldn't get any taller.  Ty put down his hand.  &quot;Pair of Kings.  What you got?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin sighed.  &quot;Good cards, but nothing to win poker.&quot;  He laid down his hand.  Eight of hearts, nine of spades, jack of hearts, king of diamonds and ace of hearts.  &quot;Those would have been nice cards to kept.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty felt himself swelling up, gaining 190 pounds of muscle and fifteen inches of dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin looked at him jealously.  &quot;If we'd actually have been betting anything, I could have bluffed you and won those cards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty mused.  &quot;Fair enough.  We should be betting stuff too, so fair enough.  You can have the value of your cards for your betting stakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
At once, Dustin's dick sprang longer, he sprouted thirteen inches taller and he swelled up with an impossible 320 pounds of muscle.  He was now 6'4&quot; and built like the most impossibly huge body builder.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;I think we're both going to be betting muscle this next hand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Dustin.<br />
<br />
Ty dealt his cards and couldn't believe his luck: ten of spades, ace of diamonds, queen of hearts, and both jokers!  He could make anything with this--three aces or a royal straight.<br />
<br />
Betting, however, also became a thing to think about.  His former four-inch dick was now nineteen inches long, and he was set to get another ten inches if he won--and the winner got his own bet back.<br />
<br />
Best strategy was to win, but not bet much, since otherwise Dustin would offload extra muscle.  This was all kind of crazy, but made some sense.<br />
<br />
Dusting set aside one card and Ty dealt him a new one.  He looked satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet,&quot; Ty said, &quot;oh, fifty pounds of muscle and five inches of dick.&quot;  As he said that, he felt both shrink down and a set of glowing chips appeared on the coffee table.<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded.  &quot;I'll match you with a hundred pounds of muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrank down as well, the chips appearing on the table.<br />
<br />
Ty didn't want to siphon any more muscle than that, so he said.  &quot;Okay, let's call.&quot; He revealed his hand.  &quot;The Jokers are both the Ace of Diamonds as well.&quot;  As he said it, he began to grow, going from 5'3&quot; to 9'9&quot; as he grew the full three and a half feet, gaining two hundred and fifty pounds of muscle and another fifteen inches of cock as the chips disappeared.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned down at Dustin.  &quot;You lost the hand, but I'll still let you gain the value of your cards.&quot;  Dustin sprouted another foot taller, going to 7'4, had his cock grow 26 inches, gained back the hundred pounds of muscle he'd bet away, and also became ten times as hairy as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last hand,&quot; Ty said.  &quot;And like before, you gain the value of your cards, but you lose whatever it is you bet if you lose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded.  &quot;I'm definitely betting cock now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty dealt the cards out.  He had a four of spades and diamonds, a king of clubs, an eight of diamonds and a six of spades.<br />
<br />
Dustin set aside three cards and Ty dealt him three new ones, musing over what he wanted to do himself.  He didn't want to get any hairier, so he set aside the king, then decided that whatever he didn't like, he could just change anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet two feet of height,&quot; Ty said, shrinking down to 7'9&quot; as the chips appeared on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see that with two feet of dick and add one hundred pounds of muscle.&quot;  Dustin shrank amazingly, especially in the crotch.<br />
<br />
Ty assumed this meant he had some more spades in his hand to gain it back, but Ty said, I'll see that with another ten inches of height, and raise you two inches of height.&quot;  He shrank another foot to 6'9&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see that with 120 pounds of muscle and raise you another foot of height,&quot; Dustin said, shrinking back down to 6'4&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ty shrugged.  &quot;I fold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  &quot;You win the pot and your cards.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin immediately sprouted up to 10'4&quot; as the chips disappeared and his dick returned to his former enormous lenghth, and then continued as he dropped his cards: the three, eight and jack of diamonds, along with the ten and six of clubs, for another sixteen inches of height, making him 11'8&quot; at the end.<br />
<br />
Ty meanwhile grew a foot taller from the four and eight of diamonds, got ten inches more to his penis from the four and six of spades, and got a lot hairier from the eight of clubs.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Ty said.  &quot;That's what we get for our puberty.&quot;</p>
