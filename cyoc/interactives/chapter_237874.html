<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chablis did a good job to keep a relatively tight ship at Belle&#39;s Bêtes. Much of it came from some of the complications from the establishment of France&#39;s Animalian colony. For while the area that had been selected had the geographic room to build a new town, it was still part of Juliet Renard-Argente&#39;s chateau and vineyard grounds. And while Madame Renard-Argente was more focused on the private school for mentally disabled children that she ran, vineyard grounds around the chateau were still active and actually produced most of the money that came to the colony. That latter fact was something that would heavily influence how everything else worked at the colony.<br />
<br />
For the active vineyard had meant that a new structure couldn&#39;t be built for Belle&#39;s Bêtes. They&#39;d had to adapt one of the existing buildings that was associated with the vineyard for its purposes. The association with the school and living within the chateau in order to be close to Belle&#39;s Bêtes meant that Chablis and the others had to have a dressing room purposely set for Belle&#39;s Bêtes and would NOT be operating during the day.  Juliet had also put in place rules that when returning from their respective shifts, they would need to remain respectful so that they didn&#39;t disturb any of the children&#39;s sleep. Chablis knew she had some legal backing for things, but Juliet also had made sure that she would retain as much private authority as possible.<br />
<br />
However, Chablis had no real problem with this. And over time, Abella, Dezirae, and Vere came to accept the arrangement as it was. As Belle&#39;s Bêtes drew enough attention that the club&#39;s shows increased some local and even out of the way tourism and made Belle&#39;s Bêtes profitable. The only thing that had really had to be altered was a parking lot that was put in along the side of one of the old storage barns that had been part of the vineyard operation in the past that Belle&#39;s Bêtes had been converted from. Adding in Kasumi Bindo had brought in some added touches, and Chablis was actually quite surprised that the Japanese Animalian could sing quite well, even if her French carried a fairly heavy accent. She was still trying to work on a name that she liked and wouldn&#39;t conflict with Juliet&#39;s name, but for the most part, Chablis let her operate under the stage name &quot;Lady Double&quot; when she sang. It all still worked.<br />
<br />
Of course, some things changed when two new Animalians came into Belle&#39;s Bêtes. One was a Hooded Skunk Animalian with short brown hair and the other was a standard Red Fox Animalian with wavy black hair. The Fox Animalian&#39;s coloration was the standard red orange body with a white underbelly with black gloves and socks and a white tip to the brush like tail. She swirled it playfully as she came in and was whistling something that Chablis couldn&#39;t quite determine. The Skunk Animalian didn&#39;t sway her tail but held it high and gave Chablis a look that it was different from the tail of the Striped Skunk Animalians that lived in Animalia. The other thing was that Chablis noted that both were wearing what looked like &quot;sexy maid&quot; costumes as they did so, and while they did cover their curvy Animalian bodies, they also didn&#39;t leave too much to the imagination.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this...?&quot; Chablis asked to Vere as she looked over the two and then looked over to one of the others who&#39;d been a big part of Belle&#39;s Bête&#39;s nightly entertainment.<br />
<br />
The Fallow Deer Animalian only blinked and shrugged back. The two of them were working over some of the things for both inventory and routine. They all danced and had their acts, and they often rotated through them over the course of any given night. But they also had a fair amount of preplanning for those acts, the music that was wanted, and assuring that there was snacks and other pieces of food inventory that could be sold as part of the club&#39;s business. There were times where it made Belle&#39;s Bêtes come off as a combination of a nightclub and a high-end cassino. Chablis had also figured out that this was a way to make money, particularly off of tourists, and particularly the American tourists who spent money like no tomorrow, even while complaining about &quot;inflation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Vere said slowly, &quot;You don&#39;t suppose...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Renard-Argente wouldn&#39;t have her cleaning staff dress like that,&quot; Chablis pointed out, &quot;we both know that... and we also handle much of our own cleaning duties. If we needed additional staff for that... I would have sent out adverts for what we are looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; the Fox Animalian spoke as they approached the bar area of the club and the register where Chablis was presently seated while looking over some of the papers that went along with the club&#39;s businesses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Chablis said slowly, &quot;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re presently closed and don&#39;t open for business until five PM.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re not here for a show,&quot; the Fox Animalian smiled, &quot;or at least... not to watch one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were hoping to work,&quot; the Skunk Animalian answered, &quot;show off these new fuzzy bodies and the curves that make the costumes oh so sexy... and maybe win some attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chablis and Vere exchanged looks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize that the club is NOT a brothel?&quot; Vere asked, &quot;you wouldn&#39;t be working here for sex... and while on &quot;shift,&quot; you would not be allowed to associate with costumers. It is one of the rules that is essentially that people may look, but NOT touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but that doesn&#39;t mean that romance and attention can&#39;t come otherwise, right?&quot; the Fox Animalian asked back, &quot;I mean... I&#39;ve always wanted attention... but never really had the body to hold a man&#39;s attention for long. And while gaining fur wasn&#39;t entirely up there... the fact that Animalians DO have the body to gain a man&#39;s attention was worth it. Who wouldn&#39;t want these?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Fox Animalian ran her hands over the now generous swell of her bosom and the fabric of the sexy maid costume she was presently wearing. Both Chablis and Vere could see there was some measure of attraction to the base physical form that Animalians had, regardless of gender. Kasumi had made the mention that she had grown a bit attracted to the Gold Island Fox Animalian that was learning France&#39;s education standards and was a bit jealous that he was dating a ballet dancer that was the daughter of the man that Madam Renard-Argente was engaged to. Chablis could understand the basics of that and couldn&#39;t deny that an Animalian&#39;s build wasn&#39;t entirely a turn off with regard to conversion. These two likely changed for the same reasons and might have even had it to an added degree, though Chablis couldn&#39;t be completely sure at present. As the two could be older and developed Regressive Hypersexuality as Animalians, leading to even higher libido levels than normal... for Animalians. Or, they could have already had a very high libido and thus saw that grow after becoming Animalians. At present, it wasn&#39;t Chablis&#39; place to ask on that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure many men would find those hard to resist,&quot; Chablis answered, &quot;and if you win someone&#39;s heart and he wishes to see you when you&#39;re not on shift, that is one thing. But you will have to remember that all things in this club are still for work and that work is NOT &quot;sex for money,&quot; do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, madam,&quot; the Skunk Animalian said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Chablis answered, &quot;that will be a starting point...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Aimée,&quot; the Skunk Animalian answered, &quot;this is my friend, Fabienne.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Aimee,&quot; Chablis answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask on why a Skunk?&quot; Vere asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To a degree... I think they&#39;re just kind of cute,&quot; Aimee answered, &quot;though, I went with the Hooded Skunk, as so many others that have become Skunk Animalians have become Striped Skunk Animalians. So... I went with something similar, yet different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; Chablis said slowly, &quot;Do either of you have any experience... or, is this all just something eagerly developing after gaining an Animalian&#39;s libido?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I had an Animalian&#39;s libido before becoming an Animalian,&quot; Fabienne shrugged while twirling her tail, &quot;that&#39;s not a problem, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily... but it may also require you take some training for things like the Can-Can and the other work we do here that doesn&#39;t relate to the dancing,&quot; Chablis said slowly.<br />
<br />
Aimee and Fabienne both smiled.</p>
