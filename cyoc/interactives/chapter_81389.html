<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;OK, fine. I'm sorry I threw sand at the other kids. I'm sorry I'm always mean to everyone here. I'm sorry for <br />
whatever else I need to say sorry for.&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mabel smiled and said &quot;OK, you're not in time-out any more&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jeremy felt a vague shiver up his back and somehow he knew he had stopped aging at 35 years old. He waited to <br />
turn back into a kid, but his body stayed hairy and tall. &quot;So am I not gonna be a kid again&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mabel was confused &quot;I thought you wanted to be an adult. Why the rush to be young again&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I may be a grown up now, but I'm still 3 in my head. How do I do adult things with a kid brain?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, of course. I wish you were mentally the same age as your physical age&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jeremy felt a sharp pain in his head as it developed and matured to the 35 year old he was. He felt more at <br />
ease with his body and understood things he never even knew existed as a toddler. His comfort quickly changed <br />
once he realised he was naked and erect in front of Mabel. He quickly covered his dick with embarrassment. &quot;Oh <br />
jeez! Why didn't you tell me what this meant? Oh God, this is so embarrassing. And this is a day care centre! <br />
What if some little kid walked in and saw me naked, we'd get arrested! Oh God, do something&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mabel laughed at the man's awkwardness and replied &quot;Oh fine, no need to be so prude. I wish you had age <br />
appropriate clothing to wear. While we're at it, I wish everyone knew you as your new age and wouldn't <br />
question it&quot;. The pile of rags that were once Jeremy's clothing combined into a ball of fabric which separated <br />
into a polo shirt, jeans, underwear and sneakers. He grabbed the clothes and quickly put them on, happy to be <br />
dressed again. Mabel was alarmed to realise she was finding him attractive. He was only a toddler an hour ago! <br />
Yet that polo shirt fit tight around his body, hair sticking out from the undone collar. Feeling flustered she <br />
said &quot;OK, we'd better get back out before somebody comes to find us&quot;.<br />
<br />
They left the building and went back over to where Elaine was watching the kids Mabel had left in her hands. <br />
She saw them coming over and said &quot;Finally! I was wondering where you'd got off to. Miss Ketcher came and <br />
asked where you were and I had to say you'd gone to the restrooms. The next time you and your boyfriend want a <br />
make-out session, you should probably do it at home&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is it too early? I just assumed you and Jeremy were spending so much time together recently that you were <br />
together now&quot;. She leaned in and whispered &quot;Besides, isn't he a bit old for you? I mean 35? Ugh! He even has <br />
grey in his beard already. And he's so hairy, eww. How do you stand it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mabel got defensive about the man she didn't realise she was dating. &quot;He's only 2 years older than me, that's <br />
nothing when you reach our age. Besides, I like maturity in a guy. Someone who's not afraid to show their true <br />
age. And that counts keeping body hair&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, no need to tell me that stuff. Just keep that icky relationship stuff in the house next time or miss <br />
Ketcher will get mad. She said I'm not old enough to look after so many kids by myself&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy felt a bit awkward about the way they were talking about him, so he cut in and said &quot;I'm sorry, I guess <br />
I came an hour too early. It shouldn't happen again. I'll see you back at home, uh, sweetie&quot;. He bent down and <br />
kissed Mabel on the forehead before walking off in an undetermined direction. Mabel tried to stop him but <br />
Elaine dragged her back to her group of kids, one of whom had tripped and scraped a knee.<br />
<br />
Jeremy walked down the sidewalk, thinking about his current situation. He was only three at the beginning of <br />
the day, and now he was 35. It was surreal. His parents were only 25. He wondered whether they still <br />
remembered him. Probably not given that weird conversation back at the day care centre. How did that wish make <br />
him and Mabel a couple? Was it even legal? Well he looked 35, and he had the mind of 35, and reality had <br />
changed to make him 35. It had to be OK. But he still seemed to have dual memories now. Memories of being a <br />
toddler, and his newer memories. According to them, he met Mabel at college because they were both taking the <br />
same course. They got on well and stayed good friends, even renting a place together. They only just recently <br />
decided to try dating and it was going well. Speaking of which, he had turned into the driveway of someone's <br />
house. He dug through his pockets and found some keys. Testing them, he found it was their home. The place <br />
seemed foreign to him and yet familiar all at the same time. Running up the stairs, he went into the bathroom <br />
so he could actually see what he looked like. <br />
<br />
Bracing himself for the worst, he looked into the mirror above the sink and was underwhelmed. It may be the <br />
first time he'd actually seen himself since becoming a man, but it was like he'd always known what he looked <br />
like. His square, masculine face, his slightly thinning hair, his greying beard, those slight crinkles around <br />
his eyes. But it was still interesting to him. His memories told him he used to be embarrassed about his <br />
prematurely greying hair, yet Mabel convinced him to stop dying it and embrace it. She did the same once he <br />
realised he was starting to go bald a few months back, saying she'd love him no matter how he looked. He <br />
stroked his beard in thought. Mabel seemed to have a kink for older men. She practically admitted it to <br />
Elaine. He pulled off his shirt, thinking about what she said. He really was hairy. He had an abnormal coating <br />
of hair around his body, even spreading to his back a bit. He'd trim it, but Mabel said she loved a man being <br />
natural. He was still muscular, but the abs he had in his twenties had faded to a flat stomach. In a few years <br />
time, he'd probably have a sizeable gut. Thinking back to Mabel, she was starting to put on a bit of weight <br />
herself. He loved her, but her looks were starting to fade. She always complained to him about her daily <br />
routine to stay looking young and wished she could go back in time. An idea came to his head.<br />
<br />
Mabel opened the front door and called out for Jeremy. He yelled out his location and she went up the stairs <br />
to find him. He was in the bathroom checking out his reflection in the mirror without his shirt on, and she <br />
involuntarily squeaked at the sight of his hairy muscles. He grabbed her by the waist and gave her a kiss as <br />
she came in. &quot;Oh wow, what was that for?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy laughed and said &quot;Well I'm just getting used to my, our, new life. I've been thinking about how <br />
different I am now. And that got me to thinking about that ring of yours&quot;.<br />
<br />
She gasped. &quot;Wait, I didn't tell you about the ring. How did you know&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't remember you ever owning such an odd looking piece of jewellery. And you did happen to use it to <br />
make me your boyfriend. Anyway, I was wondering whether you wanted to experiment a bit more with it&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I'm listening&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy exhaled to think his words through and said &quot;So I have all these memories of our relationship. A common <br />
one is you saying you wish you could be younger again. And after looking at myself, I'm curious about being <br />
even older. So why don't we exchange a few years. You take some of your years away while I gain them. Wouldn't <br />
that be interesting?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mabel thought about it. She did want to be in her twenties again, back when he was slim and beautiful. And she <br />
was secretly disappointed when Jeremy had apologized so early. She wanted to see him age until he was in his <br />
forties at least. The larger age gap that would appear between them sounded thrilling as well. &quot;That does <br />
sound interesting. How does 10 years sound to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's a little more than I wanted, how about 5 years and we can do more after if we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I wish I would lose 5 years of age which would then be passed over to Jeremy&quot;. Mabel felt a shiver down <br />
her spine as she started to get younger. She nudged Jeremy away from the mirror and watched as the faint lines <br />
she was starting to get fade away. The few grey hairs she had turned back to brown, and her hair lengthened <br />
well past her shoulders with wavy locks. Her shirt and skirt started to get loose on her body as she slimmed <br />
down, loosing a couple of dress sizes. Her breasts seemed to get a bit perkier. The changes slowed and stopped <br />
once she reached 28 years old. She couldn't believe how much different she looked 5 years ago. Her face felt <br />
so smooth.<br />
<br />
While she looked at her younger self, Jeremy's changes started. He watched as his beard gained more grey hair. <br />
His hairline was receding back quickly, a bald spot appearing on the back of his skull. The faint crinkles <br />
around his eyes spread outwards and his forehead got more lined. The skin under his eyes sagged slightly, and <br />
his cheeks got looser. Overall, he looked more rugged. His muscular body was fading as weight packed on around <br />
his stomach, growing outwards but staying solid as it stuck out a bit. Despite the extra padding, his upper <br />
body had mostly kept its shape, his pecs as beefy as ever, his biceps still massive. The changes to his body <br />
slowed once he reached 40 years old. His head was mostly clear of hair, a thin strip separated the enlarged <br />
forehead from the larger bald spot, and a small island of hair sat at the front of his head. His salt and <br />
pepper beard had lengthened slightly. He had a round, hard gut threatening to hang over the waistband to his <br />
jeans. He couldn't believe how much different he looked 5 years later. His felt felt so rough.<br />
<br />
Mabel looked up at her older boyfriend, there was now a 12 year difference between them, and he looked down on <br />
her. &quot;So how do I look?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy smiled and said &quot;You look stunning. How do I look?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look handsome, especially your new hairstyle. Or lack of it&quot;. Jeremy laughed at her remark, and gave her <br />
another kiss. Mabel tried to lead him out of the bathroom. He took the hint and picked her up, carrying her <br />
into the bedroom. They both undressed and Jeremy grabbed a condom from the bedside table. They couldn't keep <br />
their feelings back any longer.</p>
