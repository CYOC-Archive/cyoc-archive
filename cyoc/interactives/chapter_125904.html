<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: Sorry for the plot inconsistencies from the last few chapters. I was rushing like crazy yesterday. After rereading them, I found a particular moment were I contradicted with the chapter, &quot;Patchwork&quot; by ChronoSeth. That error was bothering me so much, I wrote this chapter to help tie things up, clear up some contradicting moments and leave things open for other writers to add on too. I&#39;m not sure I succeeded but I tried. Anyways, I hope this makes up for the rushed chapters from yesterday and please enjoy the chapter.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I can tell, we are in a hallway made of stone.&quot; Isaac replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stone?&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Stone, rocks, dirt, Earth. They are all different terms that describes the same thing. The hallway we are standing in now are made of material from the material plane. If the walls were made of clouds, I could probably break through them. But stone walls are a lot tougher. Otherwise, I would have considered digging our way out. We will have to navigate this place the hard way in order to get out. I recall Alice mentioning that there are multiple floors in the mansion basement. We better get going if we plan on getting to the mountains any time soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
But before they went on their way, Mary had a question. &quot;If everything here is made from material from the material plane, then would that mean we are in the material world?&quot; Mary asked. Isaac was thinking the same thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. That witch said she would teleport us to her basement so I assume that we are still in the cloud kingdom, just underneath the mansion. But that does begs a question though. If we are in a basement that is heavily fortified with stone to prevent escape, then wouldn&#39;t the mansion be sinking under all that weight. I suppose it&#39;s possible that her basement is located in the material plane and it&#39;s connected to the mansion in the cloud plane. She does seem to have some kind of power to transport to other worlds. But all of that is just speculation right now.&quot; Isaac theorized.<br />
<br />
Mary accepted Isaac&#39;s answer. But before they can start exploring the halls, Nat let out a scream.<br />
<br />
Isaac and Marry turned around to see Nat&#39;s left hand turning to stone! And the petrifaction was spreading fast! Already, it&#39;s up to her forearm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat! What did you do!&quot; Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
Nat had a panicked expression on her face. &quot;I wanted to know what dirt felt like! It felt so hard... Then the next thing I knew, my hand started going numb! Save me Isaac!&quot; <br />
<br />
Damn!  That witch or scientist or whatever must have cursed the walls to prevent escape! If he doesn&#39;t do something soon, she will become a stone statue!<br />
<br />
&#39;Just let her turn to stone. That way, you&#39;ll have a excuse to assimilate her and spit her out as a spawn!&#39; Dark Isaac suggested.<br />
<br />
&#39;No!&#39; Isaac mentally shouted. He doesn&#39;t want Nate to suffer the same fate as Ilivir! But what can he do? If he touch her hand, he could risk turning to stone himself! <br />
<br />
He tried some purification spells he learned during his paladin training but none of them worked! The only other method of purification he has is his Halo of Purity... <br />
<br />
It might be a long shot but it&#39;s his last option. Isaac willed his Halo towards him and grabbed it. He then touched the Halo to the cursed hand. As soon as he did, the Halo glowed brighter! All of a sudden, Isaac felt Alice&#39;s magical curse fighting against his will. It was mind numbing! Through the corner of his eyes, he noticed that his Halo is starting to turn to stone.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Isaac shouted in defience. He won&#39;t let his vessel get turned to stone too! Ilivir and Dark Isaac was fighting too! <br />
<br />
&quot;That bitch is not going to stop me! I will dominate her and everything else if it&#39;s the last thing I do!&quot; Dark Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have already lost my free will once. I won&#39;t let that witch imprison me!&quot; Ilivir yelled.<br />
<br />
With the combined will power of Isaac, Dark Isaac and Ilivir, the Halo glowed at blinding levels of light as it dealt with the stone curse!<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
When the blinding light faded, Isaac&#39;s Halo was back to it&#39;s glowing metal self, yet...<br />
<br />
...Nat&#39;s left arm was still made of stone...<br />
<br />
&#39;What happen! I don&#39;t sense Alice&#39;s magic in Nat&#39;s arm or in my Halo anymore. Nat&#39;s arm should be back to normal now!&#39; Isaac frantically thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Isaac. The stone is no longer spreading. And I think I can feel my arm again!&quot; To demonstrate, Nat tried moving her left arm. Surprisingly, it actually moved. It was a little hard to maneuver a little because it&#39;s made of stone, but Nat was able to move it just like her old arm. <br />
<br />
But Isaac noticed Nat limping a little. &quot;Isn&#39;t that arm a little too heavy?&quot; She has arm made of stone and the rest of her body is made of clouds.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. It will just take some getting used to. That&#39;s all.&quot; Nat answered with a strained voice.<br />
<br />
Isaac was worried that her heavy stone arm might fall off it&#39;s socket. &quot;Here. Hold my arm with your stone arm. That should help you learn how to deal with the weight imbalance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Isaac.&quot;  Nat grabbed Isaac&#39;s right arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;I you want to know what &quot;Earth&quot; is like, then ask me. My body is practically made of the material plane.&quot; Isaac offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Isaac. So... what is your world like? Is it really more then just water, air and light? I asked Nathan but he always gave vague answers. It&#39;s like he was hesitant to reveal anything about other worlds.&quot; Nat asked. <br />
<br />
And the conversation sort of drifted from there. For the next hour, Isaac was telling Nat about his world and the nature of her new animated rock arm. It seems they have a lot of time to talk since the maze of stone tunnels never seems to end. The group also agreed to not to touch anything while they are in the basement. The last thing they need is to get transformed by Alice&#39;s traps.<br />
<br />
Since Isaac was the slowest of the group and Mary was impatient to get out, she was be the one leading the group, always a few feet ahead of Isaac and Nat. Eventually, Nat got used to her new stone arm and started walking on her own. It turns out her new arm was only slightly heavier then her good arm. Something to do with water and cloud people being more heavier and densely packed then Isaac thought. Her new arm was about the same weight as her old arm. It just took some getting used to. It must be a weird experience to have a arm made of stone.<br />
<br />
Yet, Isaac and Nat still talked to each other. Eventually, their conversation drifted to Nat&#39;s pen. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder why the witch didn&#39;t take your pen?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
Nat pulled out the pen to examine it. Written on it&#39;s side was the name Excalibur. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s just a normal pen?&quot; Nat suggested. That was when she accidentally clicked the end of the pen. Suddenly, the pen turned into a sword.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; Nat gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s interesting! Can you use it?&quot; Isaac asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure...&quot; Nat said. She somehow clicked the sword again and it turned back into a pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you train me on how to use the sword?&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I already said I would. Just let me know when you want to practice and I&#39;ll try to teach you with the best of my ability!&quot; Isaac asured.<br />
<br />
Nat was glad to hear that. But for now, she put her pen back inter her pocket. She figured that she is safe for now.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
They ran into a bunch of dead ends. It&#39;s almost like this place is a maze. As Isaac walked, he thought back to this morning. He ignored it at the time but there was something that Dark Isaac said that didn&#39;t make sense.<br />
<br />
&#39;You called paladin?&#39; Dark Isaac answered. Dark Isaac can read Isaac&#39;s thoughts.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why were you quite for awhile?&#39; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh, just plotting my next move. If I keep yammering, I might come off as a idiot.&#39; Dark Isaac responded.<br />
<br />
&#39;Like when you talked about that black and read crystal I saw? I figured that my soul is the red crystal in the Halo and the black and red crystal in my head is the possessed armor&#39;s soul. What you said about you being the black side didn&#39;t make any sense. How could you be the black side of the posses armor&#39;s soul if you are a part of my soul inside the Halo?&#39; Isaac deducted.<br />
<br />
&#39;Caught rad handed.&#39; Dark Isaac admitted his lie. &#39;I was just messing with you and you know it. YOU did ignored me when I said that. Honestly, I only know as must as you do. But that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t figure things out on my own. Let me ask you this. If the soul in your head is the possessed armor&#39;s  soul, then why is half of it the same color of red as your soul? If all the souls you capture are stored in your body, then how did I ended up in your Halo? How did Ilivir ended up in your Halo as a matter of fact? Am I&#39;m really a part of the lust demon or is it that a small sliver of every soul you absorb becomes a part of your soul to form me? Are you really sure that the red crystal in the Halo is you? What IS the Black and red crystal? Did the crystals in the mirror really represent souls? How does the Halo of Purity work? It seems to be working in unintended ways. A lot of the things you know are just assumed, not confirmed.&#39;<br />
<br />
 Dark Isaac had a really good point.<br />
<br />
&#39;Do you have any intention of answering those questions?&#39; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;NOPE!&#39; Dark Isaac said. &quot;Were&#39;s the fun in telling you what I think when you don&#39;t even know what you are your self?&quot; Dark Isaac questioned.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s right. Isaac isn&#39;t really sure if he&#39;s human anymore. He doesn&#39;t know what race he is. What he does know is that he is still a paladin and thanks to the Halo of purity, he has kept his humanity.<br />
<br />
&#39;For how long will you keep your humanity?&#39; Dark Isaac questioned. &#39;Everything has a dark and light side. Even the Halo of Purity.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We need to come up with a better name for you. Dark Isaac is starting to get tiresome.&#39; Isaac tried to avoid Dark Isaac&#39;s question.<br />
<br />
Before Dark Isaac could respond, Nat interrupted. &quot;Who are you talking to Isaac?&quot; <br />
<br />
That caught Isaac off guard. &quot;What ever do you mean?&quot; Isaac asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean the other guy who sounds a lot like you. The one you call Dark Isaac. Are you talking to yourself?&quot; Nat asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;What! Is she reading my thoughts?!&#39; Isaac thought frantically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not! Why would you say I&#39;m reading your thoughts?&quot; Nat was puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nat. Was I moving my mouth for the past few minutes?&quot; Isaac asked. He spoke to her this time.<br />
<br />
As Nat thought about it, she realized that he wasn&#39;t. &quot;Then how come I could hear your voice?&quot; <br />
<br />
It seems Nat has a mental connection with him now. Isaac quickly checked Nat&#39;s body to see if she has any signs of being his spawn. Luckily, she doesn&#39;t have any glowing veins. Then how can she read his thoughts? Does it have anything to do with him lifting her curse with his Halo of Purity?<br />
<br />
&#39;What does he mean by a Halo of Purity? Is he talking about the ring floating over his head?&#39; Nat thought.<br />
<br />
Isaac was surprised to find that he can read Nat&#39;s thoughts too.<br />
<br />
So he went straight to the point. &quot;I think we can read each other&#39;s thoughts. It might have something to do with when I healed you with my Halo. You see, I think my soul is in the Halo. It seems our souls has formed a connection. But can you not tell Mary about this. I want to keep this quiet for now.&quot;  He spoke.<br />
<br />
Mary was way ahead of them and out of ear shot.<br />
<br />
Nat groaned to herself. This was the second time she has to keep a secret for a friend this week! And what does he mean by his soul being in that metal ring?<br />
<br />
 Isaac heard heard her thoughts but didn&#39;t questioned it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. For now anyways.&quot; Nat accepted.<br />
<br />
Just then, they heard a shout from Mary.<br />
<br />
They ran down the halls to find shocking sight.</p>
