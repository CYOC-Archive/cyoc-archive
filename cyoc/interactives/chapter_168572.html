<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maybe it was due to the drink he consumed or the high energy of the club but Adrian really seemed focused on pleasing the beautiful mermaid who was swimming with him to the dance floor.<br />
<br />
One of Adrian’s hands moved to Cura’s waist while the other one laced his fingers with hers. Before long, he was spinning Cura around, twirling her lovely body as her long hair sparkled from the lighting, eliciting many smiles and giggles from the mermaid.<br />
<br />
“Weeeeee! Adrian, you’re a natural at this!” Cura gushed.<br />
<br />
Adrian blushed. He had never really gotten such a pleasant reaction from another girl before. He had a few blind dates before, a couple of one night stands here and there, but this was the first time he had truly seen a woman truly enjoy his company like Cura. <br />
<br />
He gulped. “Really? You mean it?”<br />
<br />
Cura grinned. “Yeah. Our dances may not be that complicated compared to humans but you’re doing a great job going with the flow.”<br />
<br />
Adrian blushed. “Oh, really now?” He chuckled. “To be honest, I don’t consider myself much of a dancer. I have two left feet.”<br />
<br />
Cura laughed, which was something Adrian was beginning to love hearing, “Not anymore. Here, let me take the lead this time.”<br />
<br />
For a while, she showed Adrian how to “dance” by moving a tail, and, before long, Adrian managed to fit with all of the other dancers on the floor. With Cura by his side, Adrian was starting to enjoy himself so much that he grabbed his mermaid and spun his entire body around with her.<br />
<br />
Many of the other dancers noticed Adrian and Cura having a blast and cheered them on. So much so that once their spinning slowed down, the DJ changed the current song to something much slower - A delicate and gentle song vocalized by a mermaid in a tongue that hasn’t been commonly used since the old ages of the merfolk. <br />
<br />
 The two dancers embraced each other, Cura cuddling herself in Adrian’s arms. He couldn&#39;t believe what he’s gotten himself into. A few days ago, he was just some Uber driver on the edge of giving up life and now he was holding a sea angel in his arms.<br />
<br />
Adrian looked around, somewhat taken aback by the eager eyes of the club-goers that surrounded him, even Harmony was looking at him with a smile and a thumbs up. It was like something out of a movie, a movie he would’ve loved to see back when he and Tim were young film lovers in high school before like just… swept him by.<br />
<br />
Cura soon looked at Adrian, her shimmering purple eyes meeting with his. Her adorable eyes and her puckering lips said more than enough of what she wanted from her merman, and he was happy to return her desire.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes, Adrian kissed Cura.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
The eruption of drunken cheers and hollers was enough to snap Colton back to reality, albeit very briefly. <br />
<br />
He looked around to see that three mermaids were swarming around him. One mermaid was stroking and rubbing his behind with her hands and her deep green tail. Another mermaid was tickling his face with cute little kisses. Suddenly, Colton was hit with pleasure coming from his groin.<br />
<br />
His eyes looked down to see that a third mermaid was licking a slit located at his groin. He was about to see something before he felt something pop out of his tail, much to the surprise of the mermaids.<br />
<br />
Emerging from his slit was a long, aquatic penis. It squirmed around like a serpent, aroused by the touches and looking for a mermaid to pleasure it. <br />
<br />
Colton was horny, very much so until he found himself being in the trance of the mermaid again. They were more than ready to suck him off right then and there before a merman servant approached the group.<br />
<br />
“Apologies for my interruption but this is a public area. If you wish to continue your activities, please go to the backrooms.” <br />
<br />
The green-tailed mermaid blinked and blushed. “Sorry about that, sir. We’ll be on our way.”<br />
<br />
The servant smiled and nodded before taking his leave.<br />
<br />
As the three mermaids were taking their merman to the backroom, a fourth mermaid swam up to the group. She was the athletic brunette mermaid that kissed Adrian.<br />
<br />
“May I join in?” She said.<br />
<br />
The three mermaids looked at each other and then back at new girl. “Sure!” <br />
<br />
Grinning, the brunette mermaid swam up to Colton’s ear. “Hello, handsome.”<br />
<br />
Colton replied with a moan, promoting the mermaid to snicker.<br />
<br />
“I’m going straight to the point, handsome. I want you to have my babies. I have been a human swimmer since I was a little girl, with more webbing in my fingers than the other girls. Now, I’m more than ready to bring a child into this world, free of ever knowing what it’s like to have cramping legs.”<br />
<br />
The brunette mermaid laid her beautiful purple tail on Colton’s, causing him to look at it with a sense of hunger.<br />
<br />
“Think about it, handsome. Your tail combined with mine. Imagine how lovely our baby would be.”<br />
<br />
“And mine.” The green tailed mermaid said, prompting the other two mermaids to say the same.<br />
<br />
“So how about it, Colton? Want us to blow your mind tonight?” The purple tailed mermaid said, her eyes looking at Colton with a hopeful glint.<br />
<br />
Colton was silent for a moment but, after a while of thinking, he nodded his head. Giving his full consent to his newfound lovers.<br />
<br />
All four of them grinned, gently letting their merman into the backroom.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Harmony was alone. While everyone else in her friend group of minging with the local merfolk, she sort of stuck out like a sore thumb. <br />
<br />
She sighed, thinking that maybe it was best for her since she was supposed to be looking over the club, making sure no accidents happened. <br />
<br />
She hugged the wall for what felt like half an hour when a merman suddenly swam up close to her and hugged the wall.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Harmony wanted to get him out of her sight, but she did feel a bit lonely. Plus, the merman seemed to be silent and not catcall her, yet.<br />
<br />
She turned to see what the merman looked like. From a glance alone, he seemed to be a mid-20s merman enjoying the peak of his youth. He had blonde hair and blue eyes that matched his tail. Compared to his muscular build, his tail was actually very slim and long. Harmony thought the contrast between his upper and lower body was kind of cute.<br />
<br />
Looking closer, Harmony noticed his royal blue tail had a white stripe on the sides and that his tail came with catfish-like whiskers that were colored white, resembling the white tied-up piece of string that’s common to see in swimming gear.<br />
<br />
“You’re a former human.” Harmony said matter-of-factly. <br />
<br />
He nodded. “Yup, my name’s Eric.”<br />
<br />
At that, Harmony giggled. “A merman named after the human Disney prince?”<br />
<br />
Eric smiled. “Well, my mom is quite The Little Mermaid fan. If you REALLY want to get into ironic territory, I was actually a star football player back on the surface. Had a full-ride college scholarship ready and everything.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my!” Harmony said with a laugh before she calmed herself down. “Sorry, sorry! Anyways, My name’s Harmony. I’m a nurse, new to the whole mermaid life here.”<br />
<br />
Eric chuckled at that, he found her laugh endearing. “No need to apologize. My mom’s a nurse, too.” Eric said. “I’ve been a merman for about 8 years now. I know my ways around the ropes.”<br />
<br />
“Interesting.” Harmony nodded. “What’s your story? I’ll tell you mine if you tell me yours.”<br />
<br />
Eric nodded. “Well, it all started when my mother and I were at the beach. That was when we first stumbled onto my baby brother…”<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Alejandro was eagerly listening to Lupe’s story of how she was pursuing art and doing hair stylings for years when she suddenly felt a need to get into the water. He was intrigued when he learned that Lupe agreed to become a mermaid so she could be by Monica’s side.<br />
<br />
“After a lot of introduction, Cura and the gang brought me here, and now I’m with you,” Lupe concluded. <br />
<br />
Alejandro smiled. “Wow… Who knew the strange girl from middle school who believed in mermaids would be a mermaid herself years later? And here, of all places?”<br />
<br />
Lupe giggled as she blushed a bit, her eyes looking around the place. “To be honest, this isn’t my type of place. I was expecting something… a bit less intense.”<br />
<br />
“Hm…” Alejandro said with a nod. “If you want, I could take you to my home, it’s not too far from here.”<br />
<br />
Lupe was about to object out of instinct when she paused. Her friends were busy likely getting wasted from her club and she didn’t want to go home alone while it’s dark out.<br />
<br />
While she just met Alejandro as a merman here, it wasn’t as if he was a stranger. She was acquaintances with him during middle school and they likely would’ve made good friends if it weren’t for him going missing one day due to the incident with his mom. If they hadn&#39;t been separated as children, they would have had a friendship that could’ve become something...more.<br />
<br />
Whatever the case, they were both adults now and free from any watch of their parents. In Lupe’s eyes, Alejandro wasn’t a danger. She’d likely be safe being with him rather than going out alone or being with her dazed and drunken friends… plus, what girl wouldn’t want to go visit the home of a handsome merman?<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Lupe said a grin. “I’d love to stay the night with you!”<br />
<br />
“Great!” Alejandro said with an adorkable smile that would’ve melted the heart of any ice queen. He gently took her hand and kissed it. “Come, we have a lot of catching up to do.”<br />
<br />
“You said it.” Lupe giggled as the blush on her face became even redder. <br />
<br />
Alejandro tipped the server of his drink and happily left the club with a loving mermaid in his arms.</p>
