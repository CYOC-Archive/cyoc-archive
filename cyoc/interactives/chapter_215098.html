<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Barely even 10 minutes later, Ryan heard a knock on the door. He rushed over to see Jeff was standing outside. The massive tiger filled the doorframe. &quot;Yo!&quot; he smiled, showing off his sharp teeth. &quot;Can you believe I just ran here? I&#39;m not even out of breath!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean...&quot; Ryan looked Jeff up and down. &quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff cocked his head, clearly expecting more of a reaction. &quot;Yeah? Dude. Look at me.&quot; Then presented his body as though it was a spectacle. It&#39;s not like he was wrong. Bodybuilders would be jealous to have their muscles look half as good as his, but that was Jeff&#39;s normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean yeah! You look great!&quot; Ryan said. It still wasn&#39;t the right reaction. Jeff must have been expecting something more specific, but Ryan didn&#39;t know what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... Is this normal?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Before Ryan could respond his dad came through. &quot;Hey there big guy! Long time no see!&quot; he outstretched his hand to shake with Jeff. The massive paw reached out and completely covered his father&#39;s hand. A bit of a cheeky grin appeared on his face as he gave it a single shake. Ryan&#39;s dad wasn&#39;t really small. More just a bit below average. Standing about 5&#39;7&quot; he&#39;d gotten a bit of a belly over the year and the loss of the hair on his head only made him look older than he actually was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you Paul,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;How long has it been?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s been at least a decade,&quot; Paul answered honestly. &quot;You started football and then Ryan here was still at home playing video games.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Ryan pushed at his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like it&#39;s not true,&quot; Paul laughed. Jeff seemed to think it was funny too. Paul then waved Jeff inside. &quot;Come in. I&#39;ll leave you two alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan then led Jeff to his room and closed the door. &quot;So... What did you want to show me?&quot; However, he was a bit annoyed when he saw that Jeff was already on his phone. What was the point of coming over if he was just going to ignore him. Ryan cleared his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jeff looked at him a bit stupidly, but a smile was on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you going to show me?&quot; Ryan repeated.<br />
<br />
A knock on his door distracted Ryan from getting his answer. His dad pushed the door open. &quot;You guys want any snacks?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan paused. Not only because Paul clearly didn&#39;t need to come in and check on them already, but there was something that seemed a bit different about his dad. Was he really wearing a sleeveless shirt? That wasn&#39;t like him at all. But Ryan shook his head. &quot;No dad. We&#39;re fine.&quot; Ryan was about to turn back to Jeff, only for his dad to push all the way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Paul asked. The depth of his voice resonated inside Ryan. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up as he heard it. &quot;We&#39;ve got plenty of chips or even just some protein bars.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s smile only broadened as he chuckled about something. &quot;I think I&#39;m alright Paul,&quot; he said as he sat down on Ryan&#39;s bed, bouncing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Paul continued. &quot;Big guy like you&#39;s gotta keep his energy up. Feed those muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan squinted in confusion. Was this his dad? This conversation felt so weird, but he couldn&#39;t figure out why. Even as he stared, he couldn&#39;t feel like something wasn&#39;t right. It was like Paul&#39;s body was changing. The weight on his arms stayed, but it looked far more defined than it had been even moments before. Thick muscular arms rested on either side of him and as he stretched towards the 10 foot ceiling his fingers touched. Then his palms. Then his arms bent.<br />
<br />
The confusion only continued as what had always been a hefty man started to shift to something far more burly and built. Paul&#39;s shoulders rounded out as thick arms were by his sides. Massive biceps and triceps filled out his upper arm while unbelievably thick forearms with a lattice of veins went down to hands that could easily palm a basketball. His chest filled the sleeveless shirt. Two heavy pecs pushed forward against the soft fabric with a big powerlifter belly underneath it to maintain his stability.<br />
<br />
That same size went through his legs as the khaki shorts, Ryan had thought his dad always wore were changed to soft flexible shorts that could better fit around his quads and butt. No one thought that his dad skipped leg day as those legs looked closer to tree trunks than anything humans were capable of getting. Same with his ass as it was so easy to see in his shorts even without him bending over. However, the strangest thing to Ryan was that Paul wasn&#39;t wearing any socks. His massive size 15 feet were on full display as he walked around the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright big guy?&quot; one of Paul&#39;s giant mitts for hands gently rubbed Ryan&#39;s back. The thick callouses covering his hand could be felt through his shirt. But from fingers to wrist, Paul&#39;s hand nearly covered Ryan&#39;s entire back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ye-yeah,&quot; Ryan snapped out of it. He didn&#39;t know what he was thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Paul said. &quot;I&#39;m headed out to the gym. If you need anything, kitchen&#39;s open.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay,&quot; Ryan said. Something nagged him again as he thought about Jeff and his dad&#39;s height. They were both supposed to be 6&#39;8&quot; but he could clearly remember his dad having to look up at the giant tiger. But then Jeff went and stood up. There was still about six inches difference between them. Ryan&#39;s information updated. Jeff&#39;s 7&#39;4&quot;. But that didn&#39;t feel right.<br />
<br />
Neither Paul nor Jeff seemed to notice. Jeff simply stuck out his hand again. &quot;Maybe we&#39;ll see you there,&quot; he said grasping it. Just like before, his massive paw engulfed his dad&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Paul laughed. &quot;Would love to see this one at least try to take after his old man a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff laughed right along with the joke. &quot;Maybe I can encourage him a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good luck,&quot; Paul said. &quot;Anyways have fun you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Paul left, Ryan stood up measuring himself against Jeff. He stared forward, getting a full view of his torso. Just like when he&#39;d come in the front door and hand to duck under to properly fit inside. &quot;What were we talking about?&quot; Ryan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we were trying to figure out what to do today,&quot; Jeff answered.</p>
