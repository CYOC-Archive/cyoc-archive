<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick, a senior from the local state university, was driving by when the power flickered and the Chronivac added him as an additional subject. He didn't notice anything, though, and kept driving back to his fraternity. They were having a party, celebrating the end of the semester, and he didn't want to be late. He was especially hoping to get laid that night with one of the chicks who'd be attending the party. Unfortunately for him, the Chronivac classified him as a dominant and thus infected him with the virus.<br />
<br />
He stopped at a stop light and felt an inexplicable wave of heat wash over him. He rolled down the window, hoping to ease his discomfort. It didn't do anything at all. He turned on the air conditioning full blast as the light turned green. At the next light, he took off his varsity baseball jacket and threw it into the back seat. He felt better once when cool air was hitting him, but he still felt uncomfortably warm. He flapped the neck of his tank top to get more cool air to the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
At 6'3&quot;, Nick was a pretty lean individual. His arms were thick with muscle and his pecs pushed outwards through his tank top. He specifically chose this over a simple t-shirt so more ladies could admire his hot bod. His shoulders were nice and broad from years of lifting weights and throwing fastballs. He was the starting pitcher for his team and had 5 no-hitters last season.<br />
<br />
He stopped the car again at another stoplight and saw Brian walking home. Brian was on the wrestling team and had been Nick's friend since they were in high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Brian!&quot; Nick yelled out, waving at Brian. The moment he had lifted his arm, Nick felt a stirring in his crotch. He suddenly wanted Brian to get in his car.<br />
<br />
Brian looked up and waved back at his friend. He suddenly felt an urge to get in Nick's car. Unbeknownst to both of them, Nick had started releasing pheromones, arousing and attracting any guy who smelled them to Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm off to a party! You should come!&quot; Nick called out to Brian. Brian didn't even think twice about it. He smiled and ran around to the other side of Nick's car and got in the passenger door. The instant the door closed, Brian's cock got hard, although he really didn't think anything of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;How've you been?&quot; he asked Nick.<br />
<br />
Nick rolled up the window. &quot;I've been good. You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Training for wrestling has been tough,&quot; Brian complained.<br />
<br />
They made small-talk all the way to Nick's frat house, where the party had already started. Brian was just getting out of the car when something made Nick grab his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got a holiday gift for you up in my room if you want it,&quot; he said. &quot;After all, it has been our tradition.&quot; The two of them shared a long tradition of getting each other a gift for the holidays.<br />
<br />
Brian's eyes lit up, the pheromones forcing him to comply. &quot;Sure!&quot; he answered. &quot;But I don't have yours with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine,&quot; Nick told him, unconsciously rubbing the sudden ache in his shoulders. &quot;You can give it to me later.&quot; They walked through the house up to Nick's room.<br />
<br />
The whole way, Nick's pheromones were repelling all of the girls from even thinking that he was hot. The guys on the other hand would glance at him, smell the pheromones, and their eyes would widen at how attractive he looked. Nick had even had to force himself to peel his eye's away from the glutes of his fellow frat brother and team catcher. Brian, who was smelling the pheromones the entire time, began leaking precum at the thought that he was going to soon be alone with Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening to me?&quot; Brian thought to himself as he stared at Nick's bubble butt.<br />
<br />
Right when they walked into the room, Nick began to feel incredibly warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you close the door?&quot; he asked, taking his shirt off. &quot;I'm really hot all of a sudden, and I just need to cool off a bit. I hope you don't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doing as Nick said, Brian replied, &quot;I've seen you naked before dude. If I had a problem with it, I would have told you.&quot; That came out weird, he thought as he turned back to Nick.<br />
<br />
As soon as Nick's jockstrap fell to the floor, Nick began to moan in discomfort. Brian was about to rush forward when he saw Nick's muscles begin to balloon outward, especially his arms and legs. Soon, Nick looked like he could have been a bodybuilder. But the growth in his arms and legs didn't stop. They grew until his hands were as almost as big as his head. Brian was even more stunned when Nick's feet turned into hands and his legs matched his arms. Both of Nick's arms were now the same size and Nick, if not nothing, had gained about an inch or two in height. Nick's cock hung limp at 12 inches long. The transformation stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; Brian exclaimed, rushing to his friend's side. &quot;What the hell happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick just gave him a perplexed expression. &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; he asked. &quot;I just took my clothes off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just that,&quot; Brian argued. &quot;You've turned into a...a...a hairless gorilla!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick rolled his eyes. &quot;We've been over this,&quot; he said, exasperated. &quot;I'm a man-gorilla. I've been this way my whole life. You said yourself you've seen me naked.&quot; At that moment, Nick's expression changed, and the pheromones intensified. &quot;You said then you liked what you saw. Is that still true?&quot; He wiggled his eyebrows sexily at Brian, who flushed and said nothing. &quot;Do you need me to remind you?&quot; he asked in a whisper, pressing his naked body against Brian's clothed body.<br />
<br />
And the next moment, he was kissing Brian. Brian couldn't believe what had happened, but then found himself kissing back! He couldn't get enough of that kiss. He broke the kiss to take off his clothes, unaware that his arms and legs began to swell just like Nick's. He then tackled Nick, resuming their make-out session.<br />
<br />
&quot;So was this my holiday gift?&quot; Brian asked, stroking Nick's cock with his lower hands. &quot;Making me a man-gorilla like you.&quot; Nick only winked teasingly at him, unknowing that more changes were to happen in the next thirty minutes. &quot;Because I kinda want to share it.&quot; Nick couldn't agree more.<br />
<br />
