<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To Jennifer&#39;s surprise, it wasn&#39;t either Tracy or Nicky she ran into first, but Billy&#39;s older sister Eli. It had been through Eli that she&#39;d heard about the bet between her brother and Eli&#39;s brother. Eli hadn&#39;t seemed to concerned about it, thinking it was simply her brother being a twit, &quot;As usual,&quot; she added after explaining what the bet entailed, but Jenny had taken it a different way. She reasoned that there was goofing off among friends, but that something as stupid as what her brother did was simply taking advantage of people in order to make some quick cash. Mulling over this, and the possibilities of what she could do, including forcing Dennis to give back the five dollars or even tell their parents, Jennifer was glad when Dennis made the same bet with her. And with her forewarned knowledge, she&#39;d been able to rig the bet in her favour so she could easily win.<br />
<br />
A slight smile coming to her, she hailed Eli and when the other girl joined her, she said, &quot;No more stupid bets, hopefully,&quot; and when her best friend gave an inquisitive look, Jenny smiled and explained, &quot;Let&#39;s just say I took care of it without having to go to extremes,&quot; and leaning close, she whispered in Eli&#39;s ear how Dennis had tried the same bet on her, how she&#39;d won and what her prize had been.<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, Eli burst out laughing and commented, &quot;I wish I could have seen that before you deleted the picture,&quot; as Jennifer spotted Billy heading across the playground and wondered what Eli&#39;s brother would say if he knew what Dennis was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, hey, about the pool party,&quot; Eli suddenly said, her giggles abruptly cutting off. Turning to focus on her friend, Jenny listened as the other girl asked if it was all right for her to bring somebody, then started explaining that her aunt Rosie and her cousin Tina would be in town this weekend and that Tina had always been cool to hang around with.<br />
<br />
The bet and what she&#39;d done slipping from her mind, Jennifer told Eli, &quot;Sure. She&#39;s always welcome,&quot; as Tracy joined them asked, &quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli, turning her attention from her brother and his friend and what Jenny had done, repeated what she told Jenny as Nicky walked up. The three girls starting to talk about matters they considered more important than what they thought was nothing more than the stupid stuff boys did, the titbit of information that Dennis was wearing girl&#39;s panties started to slip from Eli&#39;s mind. And by the time the first bell rang, she&#39;d forgotten it completely.<br />
---<br />
<br />
Dennis found himself ashamed to admit it, but wearing girl&#39;s undergarments was actually comfortable. At first, he was all too aware of the panties and how they seemed to cozily hug his body, the way the soft cotton fabric rubbed against him, and how the middle section of the underwear pressed gently into the area between his legs. Then there was the way his boy parts kept slipping down between his legs and stopping every so often, he adjusted himself a couple times before giving up as it seemed to be a lost cause as his junk once again ended up between his legs. And after a bit he came to realise that not only was it more comfortable this was, but the same went for the panties Jenny had forced him to wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t an admittance that I like wearing this stuff,&quot; he thought as he exited the school and began looking for Billy. Thinking about what Jennifer had said about how, when they had been younger, they had played dress-up a couple times, which had ended when he went trick-or-treating as a fairy princess, he scanned the sea of faces. Spotting his best friend, he considered giving back the five dollars he&#39;d won, but then reasoned that it would have to wait until after school at around twelve thirty, one o&#39;clock.<br />
<br />
Glad it was only a half-day, as the teachers had some late spring in-service or conference to attended, Dennis smiled as he hailed his best friend, happy that at least there was less likely chance for anyone discover what he was wearing. Billy hurrying over to him, Dennis had barely said, &quot;Hey,&quot; before his best friend announced, &quot;Dude. Eli found out about the bet. I think she&#39;s going to tell your sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly doubting Jennifer&#39;s ability the have won his bet, Dennis considered the possibility that she already knew and that somehow she&#39;d used whatever Eli had told her to win. But, deciding it wasn&#39;t possible, he shook his head and retorted, &quot;Doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m done with that,&quot; as he unconsciously reached down and pulled up on the waistband of his pants, causing the underwear to pull upward and press even more so into the area between his legs.<br />
<br />
Billy, missing what his friend had down, asked, &quot;So, you still coming over this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oblivious to how his testicles had retreated up into his body, the way his scrotum had pulled tight against the area betwixt his legs and had encircled his penis, which was shrinking, splitting and becoming a clitoris and urethra, Dennis immediately replied, &quot;Yeah. It&#39;s either spend the weekend with you, or put up with my sister and her friend&#39;s for the weekend. And that&#39;s something I definitely don&#39;t want to do.&quot; And as the vulva finished forming and the fully-functioning reproductive organs of a girl started to develop, his testicles already having morphed into ovaries, Dennis added, &quot;I just have to stop back home and get a few things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Billy said and the conversation turning to what they were going to do, the two friends stood around, planning their weekend, glad that neither would have to deal with the other&#39;s sister.</p>
