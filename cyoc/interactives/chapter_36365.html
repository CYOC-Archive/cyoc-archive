<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>"Well when I first ate here, I was scrawny like the two of you. I had no muscle, I couldn't grow beard or body hair for tht matter. This all happened because of drinking the Anthro-Brew and finished every bite of... the Wolfish Man's Platter. I have to admit too, it was howling good... Get it? Howling good?"</Br>
<Br>Ron and Zach chuckled to be nice, but quickly returned their focus back to what their order was going to be.</Br>
<Br>"Well, I don't know about you Ron, but if that's what he ordered and that's how he turned out because of it... that is exactly what I want to look like him!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I would really have to agree with you Zach. Two of the Wolfish Man's Platters please!"</Br>
<Br>Greg smiled, showing off what looked to be fang-like teeth, and chuckled. "Thanks for the compliments guys, you two are too kind. I will get that right out for you, but I need to know how you want your steak and eggs cooked?"</Br>
<Br>Ron replied just how Zach was thinking. "However you had your platter, that's how we want ours!"</Br>
<Br>Greg just smiled, nodded, then turned around and walked toward the kitchen to drop off their orders.</Br>
<Br>Ron and Zach looked at each other with giddy anticipation, where both wanted to speak at the same time, with Ron beating Zach to it.</Br>
<Br>"Oh man, this is going to be awesome! If this food and beer works on us like it did with that guy, we are going to be able to get any man we want!"</Br>
<Br>"Well, any man that is our type. Remember Ron, we both like the bearish type guys like Greg."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah I know, that is what makes it so awesome!"</Br>
<Br>Before the two of them knew it, the food was out to them, it was gone and so was the rest of the beer. As Greg walked around, attending to the other all male customers that he had, not to mention everyone on the island were all gay men as it was a retreat for them, he noticed that Ron and Zach were done.</Br>
<Br>"Well you two, I see that you are done with everything... how was it?"</Br>
<Br>Ron spoke up before Zach had the chance, knowing that they felt equally the same about the stud before them. "It was awesome Greg and quite honestly it was some of the best food either of us had!"</Br>
<Br>"Well good, I am definitely glad to hear it..."</Br>
<Br>Wanting the question he had to be answered, Zach politely interrupted. "Excuse me Greg, but I have a question for you."</Br>
<Br>"If you are wondering if I am gay and single, the answer is yes."</Br>
<Br>Zach blushed, not expecting that to be said so quickly, or at ll since he was very attractive. "No what I wanted to ask was, what happened after you ate here to make you look the way you do now?"</Br>
<Br>Right after Zach had asked the question, he noticed that there were some things that were different about Greg than they were before. His body had increased in size with his muscles looking about half a size bigger than what they did before with what he and Ron could see. Also, his exposed skin was hairier and denser, not to mention his hands were meatier and his fingernails were longer coming to a sharp point.</Br>
<Br>"I want to be really honest with you two, especially since you can see that there is definitely something different about me, especially from a little while ago when we first met. I am a werewolf and before you say anything, the food I ate and you just ate made me this way. A chemical compound formed from the plant we use to brew the beer locally interacts with certain foods, making people weres of the type of food that is named. After a while, we named the food to reflect what you would become after finishing it all. We ate the Wolfish Man's platter, so that's what I became and you two will too. We, my brothers and I, don't like wolfman as a title, we prefer werewolf as that is what we are."</Br>
<Br>Both Ron and Zach were shocked and thrilled at the same time, knowing that they were in front of a real werewolf and they were about to change into a werewolf themselves.</Br>
<Br>"So are you changing right now and how soon are we going to change?"</Br>
<Br>"Yes, I am changing right now as you can see from my physical attributes and hear from my deepening voice, but I am not going to change much more than this for now. You two will change in a little while, which means that I would suggest we get you to a place where you can be a bit more comfortable. Things, and I do mean everything, will grow on you much bigger than you have ever experienced before."</Br>
<Br>The two new recruits felt things begin, their bodies tighten, their muscles tone up instantly, everything itched like they had always been hairless which was not the case, and they felt their crotches tighten to an uncomfortable feeling. When things subsided, they saw the newer changes in Greg, where his body was had bulked up even more slightly and his crotch was wet... which they both could now smell was from precum.</Br>
<Br>"Gah... we agree... lets... go!"</Br></p>
