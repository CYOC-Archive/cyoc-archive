<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a sleepless night for Ethan, and although he kept up the illusion of nothing being wrong while he was txting with Lucas, and again in the morning with Eric, who seemed to have gotten over the worst of his punishment blues, it was still all a charade. On the inside, he was most definitely going through a crisis, and no amount of calm rationalisation was soothing his fears.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t swap with someone else -- his conscience wouldn&#39;t let him trade his situation to some other poor soul who didn&#39;t deserve it.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t swap back either because he didn&#39;t have the clothing item required to do so, and had no idea who the boy was.<br />
<br />
Ethan had to face the fact that his original penis was gone, and now he was marooned with a much smaller, much younger version. He had trouble getting his head around the idea, and he went through his classes like a shellshocked zombie. He avoided thinking about it, until after the second bell he had to use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Hiding in a stall, he pulled down his pants, and gasped when he saw the result of his error.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might ... be stuck like this.&quot; Whimpering, Ethan began to relax his groin, and let go. Even with his best effort, the stream was naturally weak and narrow, the sound of it hitting the bowl thin and high-pitched. He could only stare in fascinated shame, as he slowly emptied his bladder through a trickle, and think how much he resembled a pre-teen.<br />
<br />
Finally done, he dabbed the tip dry in a daze, and another thought arrived. &quot;Pre-teen,&quot; he told himself. &quot;Can- ... can I still get hard?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sliding his fingers along the top side, he shuddered softly at the caressing sensation, which was pleasantly sensual. He went back and forth a couple of times, stroking over it, deliberately thinking about what would normally turn him on, and ...<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
It sat between his thighs, small and limp and motionless.<br />
<br />
His embarrassment slowly turned to concern and then gradually to horror as even with the most erotically charged thoughts and his full concentration, all that happened was ... his dick gave a slight twitch, but remained completely soft.<br />
<br />
Not even the smallest swelling, the slightest hardness.<br />
<br />
It began to dawn on him: &quot;I can&#39;t jerk off. I can&#39;t even get an erection. I- ... I truly am pre-teen.&quot; What had happened at the cinema with Lucas must have been a fluke due to his extreme excitement and horny state of mind with the first-date makeout, but now? Even though his new junk was marginally larger than his younger brother&#39;s crotch, it was simultaneously less mature, and Ethan understood with distressing clarity that the little round orbs that he had considered &#39;strangely intriguing&#39; in the restroom were, now, clearly too tight, too juvenile, for anything really sexual.<br />
<br />
What had he done to himself?!<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; Ethan murmured, near the point of tears. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t I be happy with a big cock? Most guys would kill to be like that, but I- ... I&#39;m just a freak! And now it&#39;s gone, and probably for good this time! Traded for a little dick!&quot; He sniffed, staring down at his groin, wishing he could look away but unable to tear his attention from it. Little, flaccid, childlike. The next words he said to himself were automatic, and he spoke them without thinking, an instinctive honest reflection. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t I get stuck with Eric&#39;s cock instead? That wouldn&#39;t have been so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately, Ethan clapped his hand over his mouth in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No, I&#39;m not- ... I can&#39;t-&quot; He cut himself off, and in a hurry, freaked out and almost hyperventilating, he yanked his pants up and shakily zipped and buttoned them, before hurriedly flushing and leaving the cubicle. Mind blank, Ethan stared at his reflection in the mirror, his tan complexion unusually pale, while he washed his hands, trying frantically to ignore where thoughts had so casually gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a normal teenage boy. I have a normal teenage cock. That&#39;s all I want.&quot; He repressed the obviousness of the situation, denying that it even existed. &quot;Normal. It&#39;s how I am. It&#39;s how I&#39;m- ... I&#39;m ... going to be.&quot; His bravado and self-delusion was meant to counteract reality itself, and it faltered. &quot;If- ... if I can.&quot; He couldn&#39;t stop a soft pitiful whimper and his shoulders sagged. &quot;Oh god, I have a kid&#39;s dick that I don&#39;t want, and I- ... I have no idea how to fix it. I need help.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only question was if help was even possible, and through all the fear and worry, he knew there was really only one other person who he could one hundred percent trust at a time like this, only one person who he knew he could completely rely on.<br />
<br />
Ethan just had to make it through the day, and get home with his psyche -- and his bruised ego -- still intact.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Skipping swim practice with the excuse that he wasn&#39;t feeling well, he picked Eric up right after school and drove them home. They didn&#39;t talk much, both with their heads in two different types of clouds, but not long after they got back, Ethan knocked on Eric&#39;s door and joined him in his room. Ethan&#39;s stomach was in knots and he was feeling all kinds of nerves -- for multiple reasons -- but he knew he had to do this.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you know on the weekend when Lucas rang me at the park?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Eric was clear-eyed, maybe thinking this was going to lead into another telling-off about what he&#39;d done with the dogs. &quot;Of course I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
For him, that day was unforgettable, for both bad AND good reasons.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he asked me out, and that&#39;s where I was yesterday afternoon. On a ... date, with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You went on a date with a boy?&quot; The younger brother stared at him doe-eyed. &quot;I thought you liked girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do like girls.&quot; He breathed out, relieved that Eric didn&#39;t seem concerned. &quot;But I also like boys too. So, I guess you can say I like both of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Eric nodded. He knew what gay people were, and though his knowledge of bisexuality was a little more limited, it wasn&#39;t too hard to imagine somebody liking both. &quot;I think Lucas is cool. If he becomes your boyfriend, I&#39;m okay with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to know,&quot; Ethan chuckled at Eric&#39;s innocent lighthearted approval, &quot;but while we were on the date, I ... did something stupid. I made a mistake using the ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Eric repeated, his eyes going big and round. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Ethan explained what he had done, how he felt more and more uncomfortable until the compulsion became overwhelming, and how he took action in the cinema&#39;s bathroom, convincing the kid to swap. Then, without going into the gory details of his time with Lucas, described how he arrived home to find the cap missing.<br />
<br />
Eric listened intently, and while he could have felt angry at his older brother&#39;s apparent hypocrisy, instead there was a recognition that maybe he really hadn&#39;t been taking the ring seriously enough. Ethan&#39;s mistake outlined what COULD have happened -- what if that had been HIM accidentally trading away his body parts and being unable to get them back, or worse? Not only that, but he also understood Ethan&#39;s motivation, because he really REALLY missed being swapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you see,&quot; Ethan continued, &quot;I badly wanted to be small again. I wanted to have your cock -- our cock -- but I acted without thinking about the consequences, and ... I got myself into this trouble.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do about it, but you deserve to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ethan, we&#39;ll figure out a way to fix it. I bet you&#39;re probably stressed out right now, but we&#39;ll figure something out, okay? I know it&#39;s going to bother you, but we&#39;ll solve it!&quot; The younger brother&#39;s earnest insistence was the kind of moral support Ethan had wanted to hear, and while it didn&#39;t take the sting out of his severely reduced manhood, it did make him feel a little better knowing Eric was there for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;ll be that simple and easy,&quot; Ethan admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got my back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I also want to tell you, that I&#39;m really sorry for being irresponsible with the ring.&quot; Eric frowned, knowing he owed the apology he hadn&#39;t yet said out loud. &quot;I guess I didn&#39;t think too much about what might&#39;ve happened. Now I understand how easily things can get out of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan pulled Eric into a hug. &quot;Thanks for saying so, little bro. I&#39;m glad you understand.&quot; He let go of Eric carefully, and held him by the shoulders at an armslength. &quot;You&#39;re still on probation though, I can&#39;t let you off too easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking downcast, the younger brother sighed too. &quot;I know,&quot; he said, and his voice broke, wavering slightly, the emotion clear. &quot;I just ... really miss it. I was SO happy. Everything about having a big dick was awesome and fun. I can&#39;t stop thinking how I disappointed you, and I ... wish I&#39;d been more careful about everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling bad for Eric&#39;s upset state and empathising with it -- he knew very well what THAT was like -- Ethan wanted a way to lighten the moment, and then an idea came to him.<br />
<br />
A weird kinda strange idea, but ... it would maybe help Eric&#39;s melancholy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take off your pants, and underwear. Shirt too.&quot; Ethan commanded.<br />
<br />
Eric looked up at him, confused and surprised and a little nervous at the sudden request, but then he began to comply. Joining him, the older brother shucked his clothing layers too, copying Eric, until Ethan was the same, and both brothers were fully naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you miss being big, but ... see?&quot; Ethan pointed to his crotch, and then to Eric&#39;s too.<br />
<br />
One brother was seventeen and the other was eleven, but in that ONE spot?<br />
<br />
They were close to being the same as each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got nothing to worry about! You&#39;re almost my twin, and remember: everybody knows I&#39;m hung like a horse! Look at this thing, it&#39;s HUGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Ethan wiggled his hips jokingly, and the teeny borrowed package flopped about as much as it could, as if the tiny worm was actually a boa constrictor. Eric couldn&#39;t help it, and began giggling at his brother&#39;s antics. His eyes darted back and forth between them in an unavoidable comparison -- his brother&#39;s swapped &#39;mistake&#39; against Eric&#39;s original junk -- and Ethan was right! They were VERY similar, almost identical in fact! Nearly the same size, Ethan&#39;s new dick was just a smidge bigger, though his balls seemed drawn up nearer to his body. He was hairless too, and the kid he swapped with must have been lily white, because the skin tone was paler than either of them. The fact that his brother&#39;s legs and groin were still toned and fit, like those of a teenage athlete, didn&#39;t seem to detract from the overall imagery of their twinship. Not for a moment did Eric think how strange that disparity was, as the idea of Ethan with a small young penis now felt so natural to Eric -- it was just this particular one didn&#39;t quite belong on his brother. <br />
<br />
On himself, however, Eric&#39;s instincts kept reminding him that his own dick wasn&#39;t the proper fit either. He was obviously -- and correctly -- meant to be much thicker and longer than he currently was.<br />
<br />
They were both mismatched, and Eric wanted to do something to fix that, to help Ethan out and ultimately also help himself. He began to think about what he COULD do, with a few potential ideas forming at the back of his mind. Right then though, Eric really did want to play twins with his brother -- it DEFINITELY made him feel better, creating a glow of warm emotion that they were in the same boat. He knew it was just Ethan joking around to improve his spirits, but it was still a huge reassurance, and there was something exciting in a non-sexual way about the two of them matching crotches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s ignore homework for tonight, there&#39;s nothing urgent for us anyways, right? Dad&#39;s not home again, so ... you and me are gonna have some fun. I think video games instead! I&#39;m making some rules though, and they are: whatever you want to play, little bro, with no interruptions, and also,&quot; Ethan grinned, scooping up their stuff, and he tossed it to the corner of the room. &quot;No clothes! We&#39;re naked twins tonight!&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! Naked twins!&quot; Eric jumped up eagerly, and turned on the console, all inhibition about being bare-butt naked forgotten. It had been a while since Ethan had hung out with him like this, just the two of them without pretension -- and he had missed it. Doing it without clothes made the idea seem somehow MORE fun to Eric, though he wasn&#39;t really sure why.<br />
<br />
That was how they spent the rest of the afternoon and evening. Games, junk food snacks and fast food delivery, with Ethan only putting on something to answer the door. When their pizzas arrived, Eric was in fits of giggles seeing his brother reappear carrying their meal after it was delivered. He was shrugging out of his underwear, balancing the boxes against his midriff, and his little white cock jiggled comically against his thighs as he tried to keep his balance doing so. He seemed like this bizarre combination of a kid and teenager, and Eric just loved Ethan this way. Something about Ethan&#39;s comfort being naked in front of him really did make Eric feel better, and while they ate, he couldn&#39;t help taking covert peeks at his brother&#39;s body, out of both curiosity and admiration.<br />
<br />
Ethan was handsome! His muscles were lean and not overstated, earned from all the work in the pool. People often said Eric looked like a much smaller version of his older brother, and the thought that he might grow up to be like that was thrilling, and it made his chest swell with pride and excitement.<br />
<br />
Just, right now, it was kinda ... off.<br />
<br />
Yes, he HAD to fix this mistake! As fun as their twinship was -- and Eric was definitely enjoying it! -- he knew Ethan was still stressing out behind it all. Eric needed that monster cock back between Ethan&#39;s legs as much as his brother did. Ethan deserved it, but Eric wanted it back too! It belonged to the Morales brothers!<br />
<br />
Something had to be done.<br />
<br />
So, before bed, he made sure to get as much information as possible out of Ethan about this boy from the cinema. There wasn&#39;t much to go on, but Eric went to bed thoughtful, and determined, to find a way to help his brother&#39;s situation.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The next day at school, Friday, Eric spent a good chunk of the morning with his brain in problem-solving mode, when not actively focused on his classes. Even though he only had a little information to work with, there was one fact that made him hopeful. The mall where his brother&#39;s date occurred was nearby, and while Ethan&#39;s school, Belmont, wasn&#39;t too far away, Eric&#39;s own was even closer. It was one of only a couple for kids his age in their district, and while that wasn&#39;t a guarantee, it did mean there was a good chance that the boy Ethan swapped with could be at Eric&#39;s school.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a sure thing, but it was a start.<br />
<br />
He just had to observe the kids around his age -- his own year, and  maybe a year below -- and see if any of them fit the profile. Taking his time between classes and during recess, he tried to dawdle and people-watch as much as he could, maybe identify any candidates, but nothing stood out to him. The problem was there were TOO many potentials. The target had to be white, with brown hair and eyes, a bit timid, and physically small like Eric himself. Unfortunately, those parameters included SO many people that he was overwhelmed with possibilities, and he became increasingly frustrated as the day went on.<br />
<br />
Maybe he was wrong -- maybe this boy didn&#39;t go to his school at all, and they wouldn&#39;t find him?<br />
<br />
No, Eric told himself, he had to make this work! Mostly for Ethan, but also ... for himself.<br />
<br />
But then, a stroke of luck.<br />
<br />
He had to use the bathroom during class, and on the way back, he passed another kid fiddling with his locker. Alone in the hallways, a few moments after he walked past, Eric&#39;s brain registered what he&#39;d just seen: dark hair, white, kinda small.<br />
<br />
The boy did happen to fit the description.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably another dead end, but I should check it out,&quot; he thought. Turning, he saw nobody else was around, so he pretended to be busy opening a nearby locker as if it was his, and fished out his pocketed cellphone. Not normally allowed to use it during school hours, Eric was well-behaved enough that he never got suspected -- nor caught -- smuggling his into class. He lifted it up and activated the rear camera, then carefully angled it and pointed it over his shoulder at the other boy, so he could get a glimpse of what was behind him on the screen.<br />
<br />
The other boy was wearing a sweater and some baggy jeans, and seemed to be struggling with making his combination work. Eric watched him for a few seconds, trying to scope out if this could be the one, but ...<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t acting any differently from their peers, and he didn&#39;t SEEM like the correct subject. Eric was ready to just give up again -- the day had been a long string of failed probabilities after all -- but something made him continue watching. He wasn&#39;t sure what it was, but the way the boy was standing seemed a little weird. It was really subtle and he couldn&#39;t really qualify it, so he simply kept looking.<br />
<br />
Until, the boy momentarily let go of the combination lock in irritation. He reached down to adjust himself, like something in his pants wasn&#39;t sitting correctly. Eric saw how loose the material was as the boy pulled it against his crotch, before he was tugging it down again into a more comfortable position. All at once, the younger Morales brother recognised it; the stance of the hips, the way this kid held his arms and lower body, the fabric smoothing that was periodically required so everything felt just right.<br />
<br />
He knew all of this because he was all too familiar with it when he had been swapped -- the very specific behaviour of somebody hiding a package much larger than normal.<br />
<br />
More than that, for just second, pressed taut, was an impressively round fat bulge that he knew intimately well.<br />
<br />
Eric breathed in sharply, and his eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, that&#39;s it! That&#39;s it right there!&quot; His declaration wasn&#39;t spoken aloud, but Eric knew immediately what he was looking at, and he was filled with a fierce conviction at his discovery. Mouth dry, he stared at the location containing the now-concealed penis, the one that was meant to be connected to him. His thoughts turned to a possessive resentful whisper, assuming full ownership, and he took a camera snapshot of the boy at the same time. &quot;That cock isn&#39;t yours! I need it back, because you&#39;re walking around with MY property!&quot;</p>
