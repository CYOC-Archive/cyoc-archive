<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie’s finger hovered over the &quot;Apply&quot; button next to the Jamaican option, her heart thumping with anticipation. She took a deep breath, then pressed it. The Chronivac screen blinked for a moment before displaying her new details.<br />
<br />

<br />
Katie stared at the updated information. Her eyes widened as she read it over again, and a rush of excitement filled her. She was no longer just biracial Katie Kendrick; she was Jamaican Katie Kendrick now. Her heart raced as she caught her reflection in the corner of her eye.<br />
<br />
Slowly, she pushed the chair back from her father’s desk and stood up. Something felt different—immediately, she noticed the sensation of being taller. Her legs felt longer, and there was a new power in her stride as she walked over to the full-length mirror hanging on the wall beside her closet.<br />
<br />
The transformation was startling.<br />
<br />
Katie blinked, barely recognizing herself at first. She took a step closer to the mirror, her dark brown eyes widening in surprise. The girl staring back at her had skin that was now a deep, rich shade of chocolate brown, warm and glowing, as if kissed by the sun. Her cheeks were fuller, her lips more pronounced, and her face carried a new maturity—a confidence she hadn’t seen before.<br />
<br />
Her hair, which had been long and straight, was now a cascade of thick, beautiful braids that tumbled down her back. The braids were intricately woven, each one decorated with tiny golden beads and shells that gleamed in the light as they moved with her. She reached up instinctively, running her fingers through the braids, marveling at their weight and texture. The long, black braids felt like silk between her fingertips, each strand perfectly styled, flowing with effortless grace.<br />
<br />
“Wah gwaan?” Katie whispered to her reflection, the Jamaican Patois flowing naturally from her lips as if she had spoken it all her life. She paused, eyes widening at the sound of her voice—deeper, accented, filled with the warmth of the Caribbean. She blinked again, then giggled. “Mi really sound Jamaican, yuh nuh?” she said with a grin, watching her reflection as she continued speaking in the lilting, rhythmic Patois. Her voice had a musical quality now, every word rolling off her tongue like lyrics to a song.<br />
<br />
Katie took a step back from the mirror to take in the rest of her new appearance. Her body had changed as well—she was taller, at least a few inches taller than before. Her legs were long, toned, and athletic, giving her a statuesque, model-like figure. Her arms were lean and strong, and her posture had shifted. There was a new grace to the way she carried herself, like she could move effortlessly through the world.<br />
<br />
The outfit she had on had also changed with her. Gone were the plain t-shirt and jeans she had been wearing just minutes before. Now, she stood before the mirror in a vibrant, brightly colored dress that hugged her new curves in all the right places. The dress was a vivid shade of red, adorned with yellow and green patterns reminiscent of the Jamaican flag. The fabric clung to her waist, flowing out at her hips and stopping just above her knees. She noticed that she had new accessories too—thick, gold hoop earrings dangled from her ears, and several colorful bangles adorned her wrists, clinking together softly as she moved.<br />
<br />
Katie turned slightly, letting her new form sway in the mirror as she admired the way her dress flowed. She could feel the beads and shells in her hair bouncing gently against her back, a constant reminder of her new identity. The reflection looking back at her radiated confidence and strength. She looked and felt powerful, like a true island queen.<br />
<br />
“Yuh look good, Katie,” she murmured to herself with a wide grin, her Jamaican accent feeling more natural by the second. “Mi nuh even recognize miself!” She laughed, a rich, deep laugh that bubbled up from her chest. There was something exhilarating about seeing herself like this—a version of her that was bold, striking, and undeniably Jamaican.<br />
<br />
Katie reached for her phone, lifting it to take a selfie. She struck a few poses in front of the mirror, loving the way her new braids framed her face, how her skin seemed to glow in the light. She couldn’t wait to see the reaction from her parents, especially her mom. Her father would probably be baffled, but her mom might be amused. And then there was Jack—Katie bit her lip as she imagined showing up to school looking like this. Her crush wouldn’t know what hit him.<br />
<br />
“Mi sure Jack woulda drop dead seein’ mi like dis,” she said with a cheeky grin, turning in the mirror to admire herself from different angles. The thought made her laugh again. She couldn’t help but feel empowered in this new form, like she could take on the world without hesitation.<br />
<br />
But beyond the fun and excitement, there was something deeply satisfying about stepping into this new version of herself. Katie realized she had always been curious about other cultures, drawn to the beauty and strength of women from different backgrounds. Now, with the Chronivac, she had the chance to embody those qualities and explore them firsthand.<br />
<br />
“Lawd, mi waan see mi madda face when she see mi like dis,” Katie said to her reflection, shaking her head with a smirk. She knew her mom, Caaliyah, would probably figure out right away that she’d used the Chronivac, but that was part of the fun. She could already imagine her mom’s teasing smile, the way she’d probably say something like, “Well, well, Katie, look at you now.”<br />
<br />
Katie did one final twirl in front of the mirror, letting her braids fly out around her. She felt more alive than ever, and there was a spark of joy in her chest that made her want to dance. She raised her hands above her head and started moving to an imaginary beat, her hips swaying as she danced around the room, laughing as she did.<br />
<br />
“Mi nuh care if mi only Jamaican for a while,” she said between giggles, her voice breathy from dancing. “Dis is di best ting mi eva do.”</p>
