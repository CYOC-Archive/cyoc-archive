<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">June hesitated suddenly and a playful smirk stopped her words before they took effect. The euphoric shrunken down crocodile woman holding onto her slim neck cringed and looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you stop?&quot; Carol glanced up in alarm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; June lowered her voice, &quot;it occured to me that we might draw too much attention here in the pool change room, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...?&quot; Carol blinked, uncomprehending. &quot;But... but doesn&#39;t everybody look at me like I&#39;ve always been a big croc girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, yes!&quot; June nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... then what&#39;s the problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I grow you and change you and transfform you at will, I don&#39;t think people will ignore that, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh!&quot; The croc nodded. &quot;I get it. Sure. So, what, I have to stay tiny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; June said lustfully, bending down and placing her new reptilian toy on the bench. &quot;Carol, I want anything I do to you from now on to be completely normal and accepted. Nobody will notice or care that you&#39;ve changed. They&#39;ll just treat you like normal and reality will warp accordingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crocodile gasped as she tingled and gulped nervously. &quot;Oh, geez!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; June nodded gently, licking her lips as her massive bust swayed gently. &quot;Now I can do whatever I want to you... without consequences.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... okay.&quot; The croc took a few nervous steps back. &quot;Let&#39;s just... be reasonable here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; The human winked. &quot;I was going to grow you back up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please!!&quot; Carol spat, gulping again and hanging her long jaws in demure cuteness. &quot;I don&#39;t like being small and helpless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carol,&quot; June whispered, smiling excitedly, &quot;I want you to grow back up to your full size.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crocodile winced and swayed slightly. She gasped as she began to stretch out, began to tremble, and soon enough she was two feet tall. It felt so good! She ran her scaly palms over herself and tried not to moan. At three point, June reached forward and grabbed her off the bench. The croc was assaulted by tender but firm kisses.<br />
<br />
She returned them with a giggle, growing bigger and heavier in June&#39;s grasp. At four feet, the human&#39;s legs began to shake.<br />
<br />
&quot;My God, you&#39;re already too heavy for me to carry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All that muscle, babe.&quot; The croc grinned ear to ear, dropping down to her rapidly increasing feet and swaying her tail happily as she grew... and grew... and grew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; June gaped, staring two feet up at an enormous muscular crocodile woman. &quot;I forgot how huge you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine. Now it&#39;s my turn.&quot; Carol grinned, reaching down and picking June up my the waist. She raised her eye ridge as her powerful biceps barely flexed. She pulled the human off the ground to her eye level. &quot;Dont you like me much better when I&#39;m big and strong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Carol...&quot; June gulped, &quot;I want you to grow even bigger and stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crocodile tensed and the audible noise of her muscles pulling and expanding began to echo through the stall. She was huge before. As more muscle and size soaked in, she became enormous. June raised with the giant croc chick, her clutches tightening around her waist as her hands grew in size and her fingers thickened with more strength.<br />
<br />
When her scaly head bumped the ceiling tile June gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Carol, stop! Stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crocodile hunched down with wide eyes and looked down at her massive bulging thighs and tight eight pack abs. She glanced around the change room and could see people scurrying around. Some naked women, some naked men. She blinked. They completely ignored the giant reptilian pillar holding up a super busty naked human.<br />
<br />
June and Carol glanced back at each other in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too big.&quot; The croc snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; June smiled conspiratorially. &quot;I say not big enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck, don&#39;t you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carol, I want you even bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crocodile&#39;s huge tail slapped into the change stall and she grimaced. Growth overtook her again. A moment later her head was sliding across the roof tiles. She had to hunch her shoulders and then her back, finally forced to crouch a little as she expanded mercilessly to a point when she could simply sidestep the entire stall and sit in the middle of the change room itself. She did, of course, her massive three foot diameter feet stepping over people while she clutched June, grew big and muscled, and horny.<br />
<br />
She was now hillariously scrunched down in the middle of the locker area, straddling a bench and spilling out in every direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Carol gulped, realizing her tail tip was touching the far wall by the door and her snout was quickly about to bang into the showers beyond the hall. &quot;Jesus, babe, stop me! Stop me!&quot;<br />
<br />
People actually walked around the huge reptile&#39;s titantic form, skirting her thigh and brushing by the base of her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;June!&quot; Carol gasped, her snout smacking into the shower stalls beyond the change room. Somebody walked under her heaving pecs and brushed her nipple. She moaned. And kept growing.<br />
<br />
A twenty or thirty foot crocodile woman&#39;s shoulders banged into the walls and she was forced to go on all fours. She was so huge that her foot was holding the door closed and her head was in another room. Still, she pressed out. Bigger and stronger and more massive.<br />
<br />
People were visibly annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, lady!&quot; A guy called, &quot;Would you move your huge ass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, fuck off!&quot; Carol snapped back, growling. &quot;I&#39;m trying!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go grow somewhere else!&quot; An annoyed lady shouted.<br />
<br />
The crocodile growled as her enormous shoulders now dented into the wall, crushing it. &quot;Juuuuuuune.&quot;<br />
<br />
The human pinned to the floor in her hand giggled. &quot;All right, that&#39;s enough. Carol, stop growing. And shrink to your original size again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skirp! The croc shrank down fast and landed unceremoniously with a thud on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally,&quot; an annoyed swimmer growled, and walked right by like all of that was perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was ridiculous.&quot; Carol snarled. &quot;Don&#39;t do that to me again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at what you did to the wall!&quot; June giggled.<br />
<br />
The crocodile looked up, raising from the middle of the tile floor, and gasped at the two huge indents in the now cracked tile.<br />
<br />
The two sheepishly walked back to the stall to grab their suits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ridiculous.&quot; Carol snapped again, annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m impulsive.&quot; June shrugged, slipping her bikini over her massive tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;No kidding.&quot; The croc grumbled, before she was overtaken by a giggle. &quot;This is... hands down... the most fucked up day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right?&quot; June produced a huge swimsuit from the bag and threw it at Carol. &quot;Now get dressed.&quot;</p>
