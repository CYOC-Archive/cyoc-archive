<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Luna stood together as you watched Kellie leave the kitchen to head upstairs and to get ready for her girls night with Roxie and these friends that were coming to visit. While the overhanging threat of the Wolf Hunters was worrying, some things did seem relatively calm for the moment and the best either of you could do on that front was simply to wait and not attract too much attention. At the same time, you&#39;d just felt glad to be able to spend a day with Luna and have fun with her, even including the official things that related to registering as a new MILF-wolf and getting clothing that would fit your new human form better and wouldn&#39;t have to borrow things from Luna&#39;s parents. It was something that still amazed you in that you&#39;d been Luna&#39;s friend for years, and had secretly wanted to date her and only to find out after finding that Luna was a born MILF-wolf that she felt the same way. After a few moments, Luna turned to more immediate concerns.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you think we should do for dinner?&quot; Luna asked, &quot;when we get hungry, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made you blink and look over to the refrigerator and the other counter closer to the sink where Kellie had brought out and set down the book, &quot;Cooking for Beginners.&quot; It served as a reminder of what was going to be expected from you and Luna going forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose we will have to cook something,&quot; you said back to Luna, &quot;I mean we can&#39;t live on pizza for every meal... and I suppose that if we&#39;re to be parents ourselves, we&#39;ll need to learn how to cook and be good parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Luna smiled and let one hand run down to her stomach and womb area with one paw-like hand. Luna softly massages that point in a rather soft circular motion, which told you that Luna was still happy about that. In some ways, you also felt happy about it, which you didn&#39;t expect. You&#39;d liked Luna, and in pure theory if you were never able to become a woman and Luna still liked you... having a family with her wasn&#39;t something you would have refused. Having it at eighteen to become a MILF-wolf was unexpected, but yet, being beside Luna and seeing her happy was enough to make you happy. Thus, while parts of you were unsure as to how good of a parent you would be, you had every intent to be a good parent.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will,&quot; Luna smiled to you, &quot;we&#39;ve been friends for years. I knew you had it in you even before last night. The question though would be on what to have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For dinner?&quot; you asked, your eyes momentarily getting lost in Luna&#39;s golden eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, silly,&quot; Luna rolled her eyes, &quot;mom said we have some beef, pork, chicken, and fish in the fridge. The question would then be on which to go with. As it wouldn&#39;t be wise to eat them all.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded and walked over to the cookbook that Kellie had left out for you and Luna to use and began to flip through it. The recipes were all fairly simple and wouldn&#39;t take long to prepare. As you skimmed over the directions for each recipe provided, you felt it might actually take longer to prepare the final dish to be put into the oven than it would for the oven to actually cook it. That was also gave you a sigh of relief as you also knew that you&#39;d never actually cooked anything before, unless you counted leftovers warmed up in the microwave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would there be any context of what we&#39;d have with the main dish?&quot; you asked to Luna, &quot;as your mom also said there would be things like potatoes, rice, or noodles...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She also said some stuff about beans and asparagus,&quot; Luna answered.<br />
<br />
You nodded, remembering what Luna had said earlier in the day about not liking vegetables. You really didn&#39;t like them too, but you&#39;d also found that as you got older, the fact that they weren&#39;t super sweat wasn&#39;t that bad and some could be relatively tolerable. In time, you accepted some vegetables because of arguments from your father, mother, and then stepmother on needing them to stay healthy and have a balanced diet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Green beans aren&#39;t too bad for a vegetable,&quot; you commented, &quot;and we could butter them... if we pick something that they would go with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d still prefer something else,&quot; Luna answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about some applesauce then?&quot; you asked, &quot;that&#39;s not a vegetable. That&#39;s fruit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll work,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;so what would you think goes with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You rubbed your chin for a moment, finding that settling out a dinner plan was a bit harder than it looked. You felt you and Luna were making good progress in planning it out, but it was still something new to you both. You guessed that most of the time when Kellie and Roxie had nights out in the past before last night that Kellie would have been left to order pizza or get some other take out food for the evening. At that time, Luna would have been in the body of a teenaged girl and that would have been the best that could have been managed. Since then, Luna had grown up and after turning eighteen and then reaching the point where her heritage would lead to her first MILF-wolf transformation the previous evening, took on the form of an adult woman in her thirties or forties. Her turning you into a MILF-wolf had a similar result. Mentally a part of you wanted to stay &quot;18&quot; even while you looked like you were 30, even in your more wolven form, but there was still all the other things that were there... responsibility for Luna&#39;s pregnancy and other things like that kept you focused on trying to come up with a smart answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... applesauce as a side could go with almost anything,&quot; you commented, &quot;though, my dad, mom, or stepmom has never served it with fish... so that&#39;d narrow the main course down to pork, beef, or chicken. The big thing would still be the other side... and many of those can go with anything, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which do you think would be easier?&quot; Luna wondered.<br />
<br />
You flipped through the &quot;Cooking for Beginners&quot; book again, and you found it quite helpful. In in you found that cooking a backed potato was pretty easy. All that would be needed would be to poke some holes in the potato and then put it in the microwave four about four minutes on high. The page on side dishes even stated that the potatoes could be wrapped in a paper towel to hold heat as well. The others that were listed in the book for things like rice or macaroni or anything like that would take more time, require more preparation, and would consume more dishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably the baked potatoes,&quot; you answered, &quot;less to make a mistake with on our first attempt at actually cooking something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna nodded, &quot;so that brings us back to the main course and what to have. Beef, pork, or chicken?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t necessarily mind... what would you want?&quot; you asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked first,&quot; Luna stuck out her tongue with a smile on her muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but I want to make you happy,&quot; you answered, &quot;I can&#39;t do that if I don&#39;t know what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna&#39;s smile didn&#39;t go away. She only came closer to you and pulled you into a hug, eventually nuzzling the tip of her muzzle to yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just being with me makes me happy,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;I fell in love with my best friend and I look forward to being with her forever. Raising our daughter and having her as my companion. Picking out something for dinner... that&#39;s not that important.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made you happily smile back, &quot;How about beef then? It was first on the list of choices and is always good. Then your mom and Roxie can take over tomorrow and have the choice on what to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Luna replied and licked at your muzzle while you then returned the affection to Luna.</p>
