<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac watched Ed trepidatiously, trying to think up a way to calm his son down. As he tried motioning him to calm down, he fell back, landing on Eric’s bed and falling onto something hard as he hit the pillow.<br />
<br />
“What the?” Isaac said in confusion as he reached under the pillow and pulled out a gray laptop. What was this doing here?<br />
<br />
“Finally.” Ed punched Isaac on the arm and grabbed the laptop off the bed, pleased that it was returned to him. “Next time you want to watch some porn use the family computer, you little perv!”<br />
<br />
Isaac rubbed his arm from the pain as Ed tossed him back the coin and left the room in a huff. What just happened? Isaac looked at the magic coin lying next to him and picked it up in relief. Whatever happened didn’t matter, the only thing that did was that he had the coin back. Isaac placed the coin in his pocket and continued to rub his arm before he said, “Man, Ed sure packs a punch.”<br />
<br />
As Isaac felt the pain fading he tried to assess what happened. It seemed that Eric had borrowed Ed’s laptop without permission, probably from the day before. For what reason, he wasn’t sure. Ed assumed it was for porn but Issac thought he was far off. Eric had just turned 12, so there was no way his youngest son was already jerking off. He couldn’t be! After all, his body was much too young to do so.<br />
<br />
Isaac stopped rubbing his arm as he realized that by technicality he was Eric, which meant he himself was too young to jerk off, causing his face to frown at the thought. Something about it rubbed him the wrong way, whether because he was realizing for the umpteenth time that he was now much younger or from that fact that he was too young to properly masturbate.<br />
<br />
Anger clouding his judgement, Isaac shut the bedroom door and locked it, stripping himself and lying on Eric’s bed. His small dick greeted him, laying in between his hairless legs and over his undropped balls.<br />
<br />
“I’m not too young to do this,” Isaac said as he used his smaller hand to stroke his cock, attempting to gain a reaction from it. For a bit, Isaac believes it’s true, his new dick refusing to awaken, but after a while it does begin to erect. Isaac watched his boyish member grow and rise in the air, a pathetic sight to behold, as it only reached 3 inches. However, Isaac was in too deep to notice, already continuing his earlier act and jerking off.<br />
<br />
Isaac struggled to release, repeatedly stroking his erection in hopes of getting a reaction. But no matter how hard he tried nothing happened, not a single drop of pre-cum to be found. Eventually, Isaac feels his balls tense as a feeling builds within him. It felt unfamiliar and new, something a boy inexperienced with his body would feel. Jacking himself for a few more seconds, Isaac finally feels himself edging before letting go, ready for the cumshot that was about to be produced. Unsurprisingly, Isaac’s cock releases nothing, giving the man-turned-boy a dry orgasm as he quivers and shakes from the sensation.<br />
<br />
Yet, it was still quite strong for Isaac, causing him to pant as his face turned red from the new and pleasurable feeling his dick produced. As he let out heavy pants and relished in the afterglow of his jerk off session, Isaac immediately realized what he had done. His face turned a brighter shade of red as he redressed quickly, putting Eric’s clothes back on to hide his body and the shameful thing he just did. Maybe he was a little perv after all.<br />
<br />
Isaac unlocked the bedroom door and made his way to the living room, noticing Ed’s bedroom door was also locked shut. Could he be…? Isaac shook his head and went down the stairs, attempting to take his mind off anything relating to masturbation.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the couch, Isaac flipped through the TV channels, the previous program he had chose now over and leaving him bored. As he scrolled through the TV Guide, his eyes grew droopy, tiredness beginning to form from his jerk off session and long day at school.<br />
<br />
“I’m just going to rest my eyes for a little bit,” Isaac told himself as he laid down and closed his eyes, soon fast asleep and snoring. Lost in slumberland, Isaac wasn’t awake to hear the front door open once more, Eric in his body entering the house and finding Isaac on the couch asleep.</p>
