<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door opened, and Cathy walked in. Like Jenny, she was dressed in a form-hugging dress, and looked far more like a runway model than she had previously. Her breasts were far larger than they&#39;d been before-probably about as large as I&#39;d made them when I&#39;d first started wishing on her, and she&#39;d gotten that same apple-bottom ass that Jenny had. Her hair was wavy and a bit more of a raven black -the sort of black that showed a deep purplish cast when the light hit it directly, and like Jenny, it was mid-back length. She hadn&#39;t made herself any taller, so she was still about 5&#39;5”, but she&#39;d made her skin perfect-creamy milk white. She was the picture of a petite goth beauty now, albeit without the heavy makeup, and her dress was sapphire blue, not black.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god! Joey!” Cathy ran and practically dove onto the bed, nuzzling me hard and sniffing my neck while keeping a firm grip on me. “Is it..is it REALLY you?”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s me,” I said softly, raising my hand up to show her my missing finger. “I promise.” I was taken aback by how much she clearly felt for me. Not that it felt wrong by any stretch, but I hadn&#39;t expected this, to say the least.<br />
<br />
“Surprise,” Jenny said with a smile. <br />
<br />
Cathy immediately turned and gave Jenny a deep kiss and whispered, “Thank you..thank you so much, love..” to her, before sliding under the covers with me after kicking her shoes off. Immediately, an arm was around me and she rested my head on her chest as she stroked my hair. “I&#39;ve missed you,” she said quietly. “We both have.”<br />
<br />
My eyes popped open in surprise. Not so much that Cathy missed me, because her body language made that quite clear. But Jenny? Really? Nothing about her mannerisms had suggested any such thing.<br />
<br />
Jenny blushed slightly. “Cathy..REALLY? Goddamn it..Yeah..I..we both have,” she said, nodding in agreement. “Joe..whether you meant to or not..by fucking us that first night, you made yourself our mate. The wolf in both of us ached for you.”<br />
<br />
“We haven&#39;t been with a man since that night..” Cathy cooed in my ear.<br />
<br />
“REALLY?” I said in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Wolves mate for life,” Cathy replied as she tilted my head up to look at her. <br />
<br />
“It&#39;s true,” Jenny said, sounding mildly annoyed at the fact. “Believe me, I was totally surprised by that little fact. Like..SO surprised. Kinda pissed, truthfully. I mean..here I was with this world-changing ring, with a girl that I SERIOUSLY had a thing for even before you met us, and now she and I can give into every primal urge we&#39;ve ever had..and yet I&#39;m thinking about getting your cock while I&#39;m going to tuna town on her!”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re such a poet,” I said with a snicker.<br />
<br />
Jenny let out an annoyed growl under her breath. “Yeah, yeah, I know. I even tried to break that, by shifting around guys. But the minute they even thought about putting it in me, I was ready to kill them. Why? Because they weren&#39;t YOU. Thankfully, that rule didn&#39;t apply to women.”<br />
<br />
“You could have wished that part away,” I said, realizing a moment later that I probably shouldn&#39;t give her ideas about how to fix her dependency on me.<br />
<br />
“I thought about it. I seriously did. But..that felt too unnatural, as crazy as it sounds. I wanted to..oh man, how I wanted to. But I could never bring myself to utter the words. So..yeah, you&#39;re stuck with us, you asshole,” Jenny said, before adding “Shove over,” and climbing into the bed on the other side of me, leaving me perfectly sandwiched between the two girls whose lives I&#39;d changed, and who&#39;d gone on to change the world even more.<br />
<br />
Cathy slid down slightly, so our heads were all at the same level, all resting on pillows next to one another. Both she and Jenny lightly slid their hands up and down my chest lazily as they nuzzled into the hollow of my neck. “I hate how right this feels,” Jenny said quietly. <br />
<br />
“No she doesn&#39;t,” Cathy chided softly.<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed, “Okay..fine. It doesn&#39;t totally suck.”<br />
<br />
“This DOES feel right,” I said, realizing how content I was with them on either side of me, despite the fact I&#39;d died only a short while earlier, as far as my mind was concerned. And &#39;feels right&#39; was really an understatement. It felt PERFECT. “This is where I belong..with my two werewolf..mates.”<br />
<br />
“It sounds weird when you say it like that,” Jenny grumbled. “I mean, you&#39;re a werewolf too.” That&#39;s when it hit me – I&#39;d been bitten and survived, which made me a werewolf by the rules of the universe now. It was why I didn&#39;t freak out on Jenny when I&#39;d awoken, and why none of this troubled me at all. Not only was she my mate, she was an alpha. It was natural to accept her rules.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s why this feels so right,” I said quietly, and both of them pressed more tightly against me, with Cathy letting out a happy almost-yip of delight.<br />
<br />
“Yup. Now I AM going to make a wish on you, but trust me..it&#39;s for the best,” Jenny said. “Cathy and I eat a LOT of pussy. As alphas, we turn at least one or two people a day, because that&#39;s part of our job. We oversee literally everyone who comes in asking to be turned, make sure that they understand how things are going to be, and then either personally turn them or assign wolves to do it for us. As you can imagine, that keeps us ragingly horny pretty much most of the day. As our mate, you have a right to be with us whenever we have sex...and the wolf in you isn&#39;t gonna be able to completely control itself all the time when it&#39;s around strange pussy. Pheromones exist for a reason. But we can&#39;t have you getting a harem, and we can&#39;t have every female bonding with you.”<br />
<br />
“No, that would..complicate things. Badly,” I said, turning my head to kiss Cathy deeply, and then gave another one to Jenny. “And..I really don&#39;t want that. You two are mine, and I&#39;m yours.”<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s rather abrasive demeanor relaxed for a moment when I said that, and she smiled deeply. “I&#39;m..happy to hear you say those words, Joey.” A frustrated look crossed her face a second later, and she nipped my shoulder hard. “Goddamn it..there you go making me act all girly for you.”<br />
<br />
I let out a growl, and for the first time, I felt the power of the wolf inside of me surge. Both of them shuddered, and I was aware of the scent of them around me, acutely aware that they were growing more aroused and available. Cathy began to rub against me, writhing slightly as she let her wolfish side start to surface.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh..man..” Jenny said, shaking her head as her own wolf started to emerge. No  physical changes yet for either girl, but I could smell it in the juices between their thighs. I was instantly rock-hard, tenting the sheet that covered us, and could feel my own transformation impending. “Hang on..one sec..” Jenny said, gasping as she regained control. “I wish..that even if you fuck another human or wolf, you will not mate-bond with them, and they will not mate-bond with you, and that this lycanthropic triad remain mate-bonded forever before all others. And I wish that if Cathy or myself should ever fuck another human or wolf, that they will not mate-bond with us or we with them, and that this lycanthropic triad remain mate-bonded forever before all others.”</p>
