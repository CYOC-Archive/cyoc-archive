<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nothing had happened and the watch remained the same. Tim looked around it some more but couldn&#39;t find anything else he could fiddle with. He looked up and almost hit a bench in his focus. He moved around it and figured he should just go home and figure it out there. <br />
<br />
A few minutes later and Tim walked up three stories in his apartment complex and entered his home. He locked the door and walked over to his couch. His living room was fairly sparse with only a couch and a tv but that&#39;s all Tim really needed. He relaxed for a few before he remembered the watch he had bought.<br />
<br />
Tim just stared at it with no idea how to reset it. He probably should&#39;ve tried to go back but he felt that it might be too embarrassing now. He wondered if there was a real reason that the watch was so cheap. He started to feel ripped off when he heard a knock at the door. He got up, and when he opened the door, he was extremely surprised by what he saw.<br />
<br />
Standing in the door frame was his mother, Laura. She still looked like she was 38, had her same blond hair, her same body, everything looked the same, but she was dressed weird as hell. Her hair looked re-styled and was now incredibly curly which was odd since hers was normally straight. She was wearing a tight tank top and what appeared to be a sport&#39;s bra that was holding back her large breasts. She was also wearing skimpy jogging shorts which Tim felt uncomfortable looking at. <br />
<br />
She looked like she had been on a run and was sweating up a storm. When she made eye contact with Tim, she smiled and began to laugh.<br />
&quot;Yeah I know Tim, you told me to wait for you but you&#39;re just never on time and you&#39;re slow so I thought I&#39;d spare you the agony.&quot; She said teasingly.<br />
<br />
Tim and Kelly loved to poke fun at each other but it was weird hearing it from his mother. Suddenly it hit Tim! His mother was wearing a pair of clothes identical to Kelly&#39;s but resized to fit her. Her hair was the same but restyled like Kelly&#39;s and her  mannerisms were even identical to how Kelly would act.<br />
<br />
She walked inside to a silently baffled Tim and gave him a kiss lips! Tim even felt a little tongue which almost made Tim want to barf. She walked out of the living room and into the bathroom. She looked back and said &quot;Hey Timmy I&#39;m gonna take a shower k? I&#39;d invite you but I feel really gross and want to get really clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim barely managed a nod as his mother shut the door. Tim didn&#39;t know what to think. He would&#39;ve guessed it was a prank but not only was she acting too closely to Kelly, but there is no way his uptight mother would give him that sort of kiss for a prank. Tim picked up his phone and called his parents house as the shower turned on in the bathroom. Tim was upset when he got a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, this is the Hanson residence and this is Laura. We&#39;re sorry we cannot come to the phone right now. Please leave a message and we will get bak to you. Thank you.&quot;<br />
Tim had heard that message a 100 times and had heard those exact voice confections to a tee before, but this time it was different. That was clearly a very old message that now sounded like Kelly, Tim&#39;s girlfriend, giving her best impression of Tim&#39;s mother. <br />
<br />
Tim&#39;s mind began to race at what the hell was going on. It was if the world itself had gone crazy. Reality had changed so that his mother thought she was Kelly and vice versa. He thought back to everything that had happened today and tried to think if he insulted a wizard or something. That&#39;s when it hit him. The old man, the store he had never seen before, and the watch.<br />
<br />
He looked at the watch he  now wore and realized he had only hit the side button one time. He guessed that it might have something to do with this craziness. In a panic, he tried to take the watch off but it didn&#39;t work. It wouldn&#39;t come off. <br />
&quot;Okay. Okay just stay calm Tim. This is fine. I mean it&#39;s not it&#39;s definitely not fine but you can fix this.&quot; Tim told himself. &quot;Okay, so I was thinking about some people before I hit it, so maybe that&#39;s what I have to do again?&quot; He said aloud.<br />
<br />
The old man from the shop had been watching from his crystal ball and became upset.<br />
&quot;Damn. Maybe I pegged this kid all wrong.&quot; He thought. &quot;I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be able to figure it out this fast. Ah well, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s bound to mess something up. And usually the longer you stay in a life the longer the watch user forgets it was ever different but maybe I&#39;ll speed that up for fun. I&#39;ll put it back to normal time after that though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim was about to hit it when his mother in Kelly&#39;s life walked out of the bathroom in nothing but a towel. She gave Tim a wink and whispered &quot;later&quot; a she walked into Tim&#39;s room to get changed into some spare clothes she left.<br />
&quot;No! Kelly left those not... Kelly.&quot; Tim thought.<br />
<br />
He realized he was forgetting the truth! He had to ask fast. He couldn&#39;t help but feel gross about kissing his mother or Kelly kissing his dad or Kelly breastfeeding for Tim&#39;s baby sister Kate or his mother chatting with Kelly&#39;s friends or Tim going to thanksgiving with mother Kelly... it was all so wrong!<br />
<br />
Tim hit the button trying to focus on Kelly and Laura and reality shifted again. Unfortunately a lot was going through Tim&#39;s mind. Did the swap work or did a different swap take place? Who has their lives swapped?</p>
