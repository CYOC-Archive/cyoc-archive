<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;GET TO IT MAN I DON&#39;T HAVE ALL DAY!&quot; Was what Scott wanted to say, he thought the words correctly within his mind but what issued out his mouth he heard as a jumbled mess of shrill cries and dull long drawn out tones. Mentally, Scott felt frantic feelings and a sudden distrust of the men conducting the experiment. As did the encasement drained away the sticky yuck, the slime coated Scott, as it stunk of mildew, tickling his then quite sensitive nose. <br />
<br />
The table where he lay was made of stainless steel, the surface coated as well with the yuck stuff made it slippery. A push with his hands at the steel surface did nothing to help move him as he sat up and gawked at the two men.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, you have a thousand questions! Well I shall begin with what is usually the first question, what has happened to you, and why do you feel so different?&quot; Said the man standing to his right side. <br />
<br />
This was the man Scott remembered was someone he had seen when first coming to the research testing laboratory for the expected medical exam and an interview for some unspecified type of employment. When with some added aid he was sitting upright, his legs lay stretched out on the examination table. <br />
<br />
Scott cocking his head with wonderment as he stared at his two appendages. <br />
<br />
The yellowish goo that covered him from head to toes clung to his body as if in layered waves.<br />
<br />
The two men then bent down and together they raised clear plastic sheets up to act as protective barriers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please sit still, the barriers are to protect us from any splattering residue, we plan to shower you and rinse off the special coating. This will take a minute or two, just let the warm water shower bathe you and the smelly goo will be then washed away down a floor drain.&quot; Said one man, as Scott sat there mesmerized at looking at his legs, they seemed different in a couple of ways.<br />
<br />
At first the warm water spray was more of a penetrating mist that began to liquefy the goo, as slowly a misting rinse then became a spraying rinsing of the goo. As the water rinsed, the fact his legs looked different became apparent to Scott, he seeing as understanding, knew his legs were not those of a human. He had then shaggy furred legs like those normally on a goat. He seeing his legs, his toes being then cloven hooves, his heels each as a hind hock, his thighs broadened with stout muscles, and all of it thickly covered in a pelt of black, and silvery gray fur.<br />
<br />
Suddenly from the front and above him came down a harsh squirting stream of warmer water, it striking and rinsing his groin completely free from the still caked goo. The stream of water felt as sharp a high pressure squirting, it hurt his much larger as well very sensitive goaty like balls. He sat there eyeing down at them saw they were huge in comparison to what he remembered he had as human size testicles. His scrotum had become as much enlarged, oblong pair of male nuts lying loosely hung in a soft fur covered pouch. Scott reached his left hand to touch, as fall and caress what he seemed to find as agreeably different.<br />
<br />
The sharp hurting stream of water raised up and jetted hard at what Scott knew was his penis, had him move what he recalled was his arm and hand to give a touch to his, by then washed furry testicles, he felt then a horrible realization as if the water had aroused his more male sensual parts. Although it was not an arm he saw, but by then it was a foreleg, the fore-knee, cannon bone, fetlock joints and where he had as his hand, were then as a cloven hoof. His reached touch of his sore testicles came with odd feelings. Dulled of sensitivity were his cloven hooves when first he tried touching the two furry big balls. <br />
<br />
Noting then from the streaming jetted water mostly about his groin, what erupted from a lower belly, he saw his changed positioning of a furry sheath had coming out a pinkish-red, nut shaped head and what was his male shaft, it goat-like, extending some sixteen inches long, and was definitely narrower than his human shaft, while many times more sensually sensitive.<br />
<br />
Rinsing showering water removed the sticky goo to allow Scott of him seeing his chest and a torso what were completely covered over with thick goat fur. He turned his head to gaze a look to the man at his right side as he then opening his mouth thought to ask a question. &quot;Baa..., baa?&quot; Scott enunciated, he bleating said,  as caused then for the men there to begin then laughing, they so noting the questioning sound the second baaed cry seemed to accentuate.<br />
<br />
Laughing, the man to the left then said, &quot;A completely understood questioning as to what you see seems improper as well quite different to you. What you spoke was the normal sounds of what you are now, you having become an animalistic form, you are a goat!<br />
<br />
Your toned bleating sound was enunciated with such a mind questioning what sort of body it was then inside. The experiment has begun, and phase one was the need to change you in species. We had need of a male goat to make the testing as easier on all concerned. Your new species is as a Capra or a goat and being such, we induced Boer breed hormones of meat goat, not that we plan to slaughter you in time, as no, no sir not at all!<br />
<br />
You are a very well endowed male goat, with the full range of sensual feelings of what it is like to remember being as a human while changed into being an animalistic body, with a mental realization of what you are now. You noted your erection, and the feel of a wealth of semen boiling there inside those two masculine globes hung between your now, hind... legs.<br />
<br />
Our processing of you and your body is an early experiment in doing the phased change. At present there is no know way to alter your form again and return you to being human. <br />
<br />
I suspect in due time that reversed phasing will be available, but for now and the near future, you shall tend to the duties of a goat buck to stand, hump, and f..., fornicate sire with females, doe goats mostly, and some sedated women. You need to understand for now the information that your lifespan as being human has not changed. <br />
<br />
Although what is the real you is drastically different, you being as is a male goat, if born a goat, you might have lived some ten to fifteen years and then died. As what you were and having become altered, your life expectancy as a goat is similar to that of a human, you living for seventy years. In time and after some hundreds of mating sessions, the thought or mental concern as to your future or life expectancy will be but a forlorn memory.<br />
<br />
Indeed, your every waking hour will be with thoughts of making use of your sexually sensitive shaft and feeling the thrill of an orgasm.&quot; <br />
<br />
The listening and squirting water had done much to bring Scott to a peaked arousal. The wildly sensuous feelings he preferred, as never felt before such a need. Scott began jerking of the pelvis, the testicles being roused, sent forth a wealth of semen and white juices along his shaft, as erupting a long streaming of its own, jetting the spew to splatted along at his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, a fine ejaculation and the complete depletion of any human semen. This assures your big balls have nothing but goat semen, effectively damning you to being, as liking your body, it as a stud buck goat!&quot; The man to the right side said, and he with his friend found the bleated feelings of personal peril as quite funny.<br />
<br />
Minutes later when with the shower rinsing completed, the barriers lowered, Scott still sat there with his mind in a fog, as the men turned him, allowing those stout hind legs and feet to hang off the exam table. Another person came into the room, she being a nurse, walked up to stand along side Scott while he still sported his goaty erection. <br />
<br />
Scot just watched as the nurse reached a gloved hand to take hold of his stout erection, she began milking him, his red cock rigid, spit-sput, spewed the last vestiges of his link to humanity.<br />
<br />
The final ejaculations done and the two men took hold Scott by what then were his forelegs and chest, they holding him in a stretched upright standing position as the nurse came around with a wheelchair and they let him slink into and sit in the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy the ride, this is the last time you will ever get to sit and/or ride in a wheelchair. So soon you will want to walk on all fours, as should a goat!&quot; The nurse said, she talking to Scott while he was able to understand the language.<br />
<br />
Scott bleated his answered response, the nurse wheeling him along in the wheelchair, she remarked said to him, &quot;the name Scott might be a good name, but you being now a stud buck goat, I will change your name to being Randy! <br />
<br />
Randy is a male goat, and as you begin your training to be a herd sire goat, the word randy suggests well your manners of sexually. When you feel beastly horny, as randy, you ideals of morality shall fade, allowing a willingness to become a stud goat!<br />
<br />
Know this too, that while you retain your intellect, and when feeling horny, I will be there to help quell that animal passion for acting sexual.&quot;</p>
