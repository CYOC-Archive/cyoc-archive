<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael promised to stay out of the forest and stick to the path.  He could wander into the village, if he <br />
would agree to pick up the mail at the post office and a pound of cheese for tonight's dinner. He grudgingly <br />
agreed.  <br />
<br />
He was halfway to town, when a young male voice called out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you're new around here! What're ya called?&quot; shouted someone from the side of the road.<br />
<br />
Michael turned his head.  He saw a tow haired lean young man stretched out on  a low rock wall sunning <br />
himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's Michael.  I'm staying up at my Aunt Dedrana's,&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike? Oh, I bet that's fun,&quot; he chortled, &quot;Staying up at that crazy ol' bat's place. It's like a haunted <br />
house. 'Course it's not really haunted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. How much farther to town?&quot; Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too much farther.  It's a hot day, I'm going over to the mill pond and take a skinny dip. Care to join me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but maybe some other time.  I promised to get to get some things in town for Aunt Dedrana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, turning down my hospitable offer, but for a promise's sake. I think I like you,&quot; the lad said hopping off <br />
the fence and lightly stepping through the grass to the road.  Michael barely noticed at the time, but the <br />
tall blades of grass between the wall and the road seemed undisturbed by the young man's passage.  If Michael <br />
had walked there, great numbers would have been smashed down.<br />
<br />
The lad extended his hand and shook Michael's hand firmly, &quot;I'm Robin, but you can call me Rob.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Rob, nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll walk with you to the village.  It's not rightly a town, barely rightly a village. Still <br />
companionship makes time go faster - or so says my granny,&quot; he went on.  He was standing a might closer than <br />
Michael was used to people standing, but he felt good about his new friend and didn't mind.  He was soon <br />
telling this stranger all about his family, and how they had to live with their aunt or be separated. Then he <br />
told Rob about the faeries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aah,&quot; Rob said knowingly touching his nose, &quot;Your auntie is right. Interesting things do happen around <br />
hereabouts.  Interesting can be good or bad.  Though the term faeries does seem a bit inadequate and confusing <br />
to describe the beasties and beings that may frequent this circle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Circle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the whole valley is round and surrounded by monolithes like at Stone Henge. It's a giant fairy circle, so <br />
naturally it attracts magical things. I think you might advise your auntie to use analogy to explain her <br />
concerns to your younger siblings.  Best describe the things in the circle as fairies or elementals because <br />
they are natural things like fire.  Fire isn't good or evil, it help keep you warm or it can burn you. Same <br />
with fae folk and beasties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fae folk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fae is like fate or destiny.  It's what the creatures are rightly called.  But over the years people <br />
corrupted the words into fairy,&quot; Rob explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure know a lot about this stuff,&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye, Mike, I should. I've lived here nigh on forever,&quot; Rob said drapping his arm across Michael's shoulder, <br />
&quot;And I can show you a thing or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't mind find a tele to catch a football match while we're in town.  Aunt Dedrana doesn't have a <br />
television,&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, they've got one of those big screens over at the pub,&quot; Rob said lightly. His arm on Michael's shoulder <br />
guided him across the road toward the tavern.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm too young to drink,&quot; Michael blurted out.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not going to drink. You're going to watch,&quot; Robin said shaking his head. He guided Michael around <br />
through the garden and into the lounge through the window of an open dutch door. He put one hand on the wooden <br />
ledge of the door, and vaulted into the pub. He motioned to Michael to follow, &quot;Come on now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael did so less gracefully leaving a footprint on the dutch door's shelf.<br />
<br />
They snickered. Surprisingly, there was no one in the sunporch lounge.  It wasn't that surprising, as it was <br />
like a sauna in the glass room, but there was a big screen TV.  The game came on.  Rob watched, and didn't say <br />
much, as Michael gave the play by play. The match was almost over when the barkeep discovered Michael.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jes' watching the game,&quot; Michael said standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what made you think you could just stroll in here and watch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's a public house, and Rob and I - &quot; Michael paused.  Where was Rob?  Michael continued, &quot;Anyway, <br />
when I came in I didn't see you or any other strangers, so I sat down and watched the match. Funny, most of <br />
the time I expect there would be other guys wanting to watch the match too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the time there would be except this Tele is busted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is?&quot; Michael said pointing at the screen as the final scores were displayed.<br />
<br />
The barkeep's jaw dropped, &quot;So how did ya fix it?  It wasn't working when I unplugged -&quot; the barkeep stopped <br />
speaking.  He was holding the power cord and plug in his hand. The game was still on the screen. Then it <br />
flickered off. &quot;It's been unplugged this whole time, how could you be watching?&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you just unplugged it now,&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; demanded the burly man looming over Michael.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's Michael, I'm staying at my Aunt Dedrana's with my brothers and sisters,&quot; he rambled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; demanded the big man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, now leave Michael alone,&quot; said Rob from the corner of the room where he squated perched on the shelf of <br />
the dutch door. He was half outside and half inside. &quot;You should be grateful that your tele is working now, <br />
and not go questioning innocent folk.  I think some people call it bad karma, might make all your beer go <br />
stale and flat, if you make too much of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's he?&quot; the man demanded of Michael.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's Robin-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Robin Goodfellow?&quot; said the man incredulously with a hint of horror in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure about his last name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry gents.  How about a pint for both of you. On the house. I apologize for my manners, the heat's a <br />
bit got me nerves off.  I wish my air conditioner was working as well as you fixed my tele,&quot; he said dashing <br />
behind the bar and grabbing some glasses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm too young to drink legally,&quot; Michael said, but he was a bit hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got ginger beer too,&quot; the man offered, &quot;I really need to make up for my bad behavior earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you need a gentler nature,&quot; Robin said from the far side of the room by the thermostat. He tentatively <br />
tapped it, and a loud whooshing sound followed as cold air blasted out of the vents. &quot;Just needed to tap the <br />
thermostat.  The thermocouple was just stuck. Now I think I'll try one of your frosty cold ones.&quot;  He climbed <br />
up on the barstool, and patted the one next to him, and Michael joined him.<br />
<br />
It was odd the barkeep served them. He looked straight at Michael, but he seemed to look all around Robin, and <br />
never straight at him. He even stared at Robin's glass as he raised and drank it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange fellow,&quot; Michael whispered, &quot;Ah, people see what they want to see or not for that matter.&quot; Robin <br />
winked.<br />
<br />
From the corner behind the bar, the big man trembled as he watched the half filled pint of beer floating in <br />
midair being drunk by an unseen guest. Still his television, and air conditioning were working again, and all <br />
it cost him was two beers.  He should be happy and grateful, and part of him was, but part of him was <br />
terrified. Robin Goodfellow was in his pub. The most powerful, caprious and dangerous fairy in the woods was <br />
sitting - well, probably sitting - on the stool next to this young lad who seemed to be oblivious. He could <br />
hear the human, but only heard Robin when Robin wanted him to hear.  So the conversation that they were <br />
currently having was extremely disconcerting.  He heard Michael talking about the match, and how Beckham and <br />
Magee and Perk had made that goal. Michael would pause for Robin's presumed response. He'd say, &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; or <br />
&quot;that's right&quot; and laugh.<br />
<br />
Eventually, their glasses were empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like another?&quot; the barkeep said nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks no - unless you want one Rob?&quot;<br />
<br />
The barkeep looked expectantly at the empty stool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, we'll be back tomorrow. Which way is the post office? I need to pick up the mail,&quot; Mike asked <br />
jumping off his stool.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and your friend are always welcome here,&quot; the barkeep said with a forced smile and sweat on his brow in <br />
spite of the cool air blasting on him from overhead, &quot;The post office is just on the other side of the <br />
fountain in the center square. Big green building, it's the market too. You cannot miss it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem. And thanks to your friend Rob for fixing that pesky thermostat,&quot; he said, &quot;And tele.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robin laughed, and this time the man heard him. He nearly dropped the glass he had been nervously polishing.</p>
