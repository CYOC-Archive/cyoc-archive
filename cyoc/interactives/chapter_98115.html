<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they began to make there way to the bathroom they relised they had to do something about the cord connecting them. Violet felt the cord disconect and slither back into her. The only sign it was there was the wetness on the floor. As they reached the bathroom and filled the tub jen started to figet. The akwardness of what just happened was getting to her. Just as she was about to talk to violet she was supprised with a sudden pair of hands wrapping around her waist from behind.<br />
<br />
As violet was waiting for the tub to fill a light haze entered her mind. It made her slowly forget about jens situation and slowly replace the image of jen with an adorible 7 year old girl who looked like a much younger version of herself. When the tub was full all she could see in jens place was her 7 year old daughter who was dirty and in need of a good scrub. So with a suddeness that surprised jen violet picked her up and before she could protest was sat down in the water on the lap of an also naked violet.<br />
<br />
Feeling the hot water surrounding jen she dicided to just try to relax and forget about everything  and soon faded into an exausted sleep but violet had other plans. With the new memories slowly working there way into violets head she remembered several instances where her 7 year old daughter fell asleep in the bath with her so she carefuly got out the special young kids shampoo that her daughter complained was for babys the other day. With a careful presision she carefuly applied it and rinced the hair of her now sleeping daughter. She then carefully got out and applied some special body lotion that could be added to the water. Little did she know that the curse took wearing something of that age groop quite seriously. And while violet liked it as it made her skin soft it would have some very intresting side affects when jen woke.<br />
<br />
After washing jen and drying her while carefuly making shure she was asleep. Violet went looking for some clothes for jen. She soon found some clothes that her baby cousin had left after baby siting for her relitives. She couldnt find any thing else for jen to where and suddenly she felt like an idea struck her. This could be her chance of breaking her daughter of her habbit of falling asleep in the tub and get back at her for making a sean at the store earlyer and get some cute pictures as well. She went over to the cabinet where she had a small stash of diapers for when her cousin had come. Seing as she was 4 she was not pottie trained and required overnight diapers. Violet took out the changing supplies and carefuly and slowly started rubbing baby lotion on jens posterior and front followed by a light dusting of baby powder.<br />
<br />
She slowly lifted jens legs up and slid the diapher under her bottom. Thanks to the curse it fit nice and snug while jen hardly stired. Gigling softly violet started putting the rest of the outfit which consisted of purple pullups whith a nice pink frilly onesei that also fit thanks to the curse making it so that the onesei streched around and buttoned up whith out waking up the sleeping girl. Violet quietly got her camara and got a few quick photoes before gently and carefuly retreving three iteams that would make jens life there the most humiliating she had ever had in her life.<br />
<br />
The first was a baby safety lock for the onesei to make shure that it woudn&#39;t come off or be taken off by accident. These were here because her baby cousin liked to tear off any clothing she had before she went to sleep and her parents were trying to break that habbit. The second was a set of little pink baby mittions made with special ribbons that were made to be extra strong. And the last and greatest was a pacifier. Not an ordinary one but one of those made to wrap around someones head to be tied off. This was for when her cousin through her temper tantrums to quiet her. <br />
<br />
Violet carfuly picked up jen and thought on how she could get the pacifier into her mouth without waking her. She then had a briliant idea. She slowly warmed some milk while mixing in a little sugar while keeping the head of the pacifier in it and then took it out and slowly put it to jens lips. Thanks to the outfit and the curse jens subconcious reaction at her origional age was surpressed and acted like any small child would naturaly do. She parted her lips slightly and violet gently put it into her mouth. When jen started to suck an it violet secured it to her head and then put jen in her cousins crib. Satisfied with her work she paused as a slightly crule but funny idea accured to her she silently took jens mitted hand and ith some warm water applied to her hand which soaked the mitton. Violet didnt know if it was true about the warm water on the hand would do it but it would be something to look forward to in the mornimg. And with that she went to sleep.</p>
