<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting back in the stall, you twiddled your fingers as you wait for the crowd to clear. Naturally, you got bored, and you let your mind wander about the events that occurred during the day. Is this &#39;power&#39; a direct cause of Senior Takeover? Why were you given this power before the actual Senior Takeover? Are there others like you?<br />
<br />
There were many questions left to be answered, but you decide that you should first understand the principles of your newfound power. After gaining some insight while you were in Evan, you had a better understanding, but you still don&#39;t know the basics, mainly: when to initiate and stop it, how to specifically target someone, and what the limits were. Your head spun as numerous options present themselves in front of you. You could only imagine that it would take you multiple tries to fully understand the mechanics of your newfound power. Since you were only a month into the school year, the semester was still at the beginning, so classes were not difficult yet. This meant you luckily had ample time to experiment. Also, because your parents both worked late into the night, you could stay after school whenever you wanted to test out your power. Such as right now. While you would usually be in a rush to get home to play video games, you realize that you don&#39;t mind staying a while longer at school today if it meant trying your power once more.<br />
<br />
You first try to focus on choosing your target host. Whenever you used your power before, you remembered that you let your mind wander, which meant you most likely chose your target subconsciously. You also realized that you were in different hosts on each of your previous attempts, making you wonder if you were even able to possess previous hosts.<br />
<br />
First focusing on your dad, you reminded yourself on Dad&#39;s bulky features, as well as his hairy arms and long member. Although it would be hard to admit in person, you had always seen your dad as a role model in spite of the numerous differences between you two. After all, your dad had a lot of positive traits that you would seek in an adult. He was kind, responsible, and a hard worker. Your dad worked as a software engineer, your dream career, and often came home late on weekdays. However, even though he worked long hours, he still managed to save enough time to spend quality time with you and your mom. He furthered showed his capability of being an adult by always being responsible for his family, such as his handiness around the house or planning financial backups (although your mom also helped with the latter since she was more familiar in business and finances). As your mom would say to you from time to time, the man Dad was had signature qualities of being an adult. Yet, you would only become confused when your mom told you this. You had legally just become an adult three weeks ago by turning 18. However, you didn’t really feel as if you were an actual adult yet. Would replicating the same actions your dad does make you feel like a REAL adult? Some would take years to complete! If you’re being honest, you had hoped that by possessing a mature body, it would immediately put you into this higher status, but that didn’t seem to be the case. You guess that this power could allow you to experience non-physical qualities of adulthood sooner. As embarrassed as you were to admit it, you had to acknowledge that you had been focusing too much on the sensual qualities of the people you possessed, and that you should try focusing more on their character and responsibilities. This also meant that besides possessing your dad, you would have to possess as many people as possible, so you could view the different qualities of being an adult.<br />
<br />
Pondering this much, you were surprised you did not feel the same haziness you had felt before or that you weren’t already in Dad&#39;s office or something. You quickly assumed that perhaps distance was a limitation, as your dad worked far away from the school. (Now that you thought about it, that might also be a reason why you stayed in your dad&#39;s body for only several minutes.) Disappointed that your top choice was gone, you shifted your focus to your other two previous hosts. Coach Lucas would be the most appealing choice after your dad, sharing the same hulky appearance while having the same tender demeanor. You don&#39;t know much else about Coach Lucas, but owning those qualities should be a good enough reason to possess him, right? On the other hand, Evan kinda reminded you of yourself, lean, smooth-skinned, and not as imposing, which made you feel slightly better about yourself. Of course, he was a new teacher, and a young one at that, but students respected him all the same during his periods. He also acted mature and in control, features that you hadn’t quite developed yet. Also, you still felt bad for leaving him in that state, potentially tarnishing his mature reputation.<br />
<br />
Stopping yourself from wandering too far off, you took a deep breath before making your next move.</p>
