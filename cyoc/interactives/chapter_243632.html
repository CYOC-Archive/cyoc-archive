<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">|| Hi I’m the author of this reversion syndrome tale. This is a one off story about Kyle discussing his thoughts with his mom, and her accepting her son for what he is. Personally felt a tiny touch of wholesome would be nice. Hope y’all have enjoyed my writing so far (first time writing smut lol).||<br />
<br />
Now confirming exactly what he was, Kyle of course had to prepare. His new owner could take over any day now. And he wanted her to have the best life. He’d should start by going to the mall and buying her some clothes, but what size was she? Realizing he had no way of knowing, he decided he’d move to the next thing on his list, clean his house. Looking over the house though, it looked spotless to him. Maybe when his owner took over, she’d find stuff to add to “a lady’s touch” too but from his perspective it was pretty clean. <br />
<br />
All that he had left to do was explain his situation to his family and friends. He had already explained his situation to his girlfriend, she was supportive and even would be joining him as he went to join the support group at one of their meetings. Extended family he realized, he didn’t need to provide an explanation as he rarely saw them as is. Siblings, they needn’t know, as they’d just ridicule him, better if his owner builds her own relationship with them. His father has passed when he was young, so he needn’t worry about him either.<br />
<br />
All that left was his mother. He was terrified of explaining his situation. What would she think of him? Her own son, nothing but a vagina, meant to take dicks, expel pee, and push out babies. Would she even believe him? Where would he even start with explaining? Kyle paced his house, dreading calling his mother. He had to do it now. The sooner the better. Now knowing what was happening to him, he felt like he was on borrowed time until he reversed. <br />
<br />
Finally, he called. Unsurprisingly, it went to voicemail, that would make this A LOT easier. “Hey, mom”, Kyle began, slightly exasperated, “I just had something really important to tell you. Recently I’ve been thinking and I realized something. Mom, I think soon I’m gonna-“ Click. “Kyle?” Kyle froze. It was his mother’s voice. She must’ve saw he was leaving a voicemail and decided to pick up the phone. “What were you saying Kyle? Did you finally decide you’re gonna propose to Mary?” Kyle’s Mom happily asked. Kyle was searching for his words, he realized he couldn’t tell her over the phone, he needed to properly explain his situation, to tell her goodbye. “No, not quite. But I do realize, I need to tell you this in person. Could I come see you?” Kyle’s mom happily accepted the offer, excited to see her son, not knowing what he had to tell her would change their relationship forever. Unbeknownst to both of them, it would be for the better for both parties.<br />
<br />
Kyle arrived at his mother’s house. He had prepared what to tell her on the drive here. He even had an idea what to say if things go south. Last thing he wants is for her to think he’s crazy then lock him in the nuthouse. His owner probably wouldn’t want to spend her first moments awake in a straight jacket. <br />
<br />
As Kyle entered the house, he could smell his mom just finished baking a pie of some kind. “Probably trying to get me to stay for awhile,” Kyle thought to himself, “Shame she’s probably not gonna even want to look me in the eye after what I’m about to tell her.”<br />
<br />
“Kyle!”, his mother exclaimed, “I’m so happy you made it here safe. Please sit down, I just made cherry pie, your favorite!” Kyle sat at the end of the table, hoping she would sit on the other end, chances of her lunging over the table and strangling him would be decreased the more space between them. His mother of course sat right beside him, wanting to be as close to her son as possible, rarely seeing him since he moved out and went to college. <br />
<br />
“So, Kyle, what is it you wanted to talk about?” His mother asked, cheerful as ever. Kyle breathed deep, preparing himself for the doozy of a conversation he’s about to have with his own mom. “Well mom, it’s actually gonna sound pretty crazy, but promise me you won’t judge?” Kyle hesitantly said, ready for her to scold him after every word that left his mouth. “I’d never judge you, please tell me.”<br />
<br />
“Well lately I’ve been having these thoughts, like my body… well it just isn’t right. I feel like I’m meant to be a beautiful woman, but it goes a bit deeper than that… I think… I think I’m meant to be a vagina. And I know that sounds crazy but-“, “Let me stop you right there”, his mom cut him off.  Kyle knew this would happen, already mentally preparing for hell. “So you’re saying you believe you’re meant to be a vagina and not a man?”, his mom said, with what sounded like annoyance in her voice. “Y-yes, b-b-but if you just let me explain-“ Kyle started, but his mom interjected, “No need. I understand.” Kyle was shocked. “You understand?” Could his mother also be reversing?<br />
<br />
 “First off son,”, Kyle’s mother said, her voice the most joyous Kyle had ever heard it, “I’ll always accept you. I love you. Nothing will ever change that love, even if one day it also becomes love for your new owner. Secondly, do you think is the first time I’ve ever heard of reversion syndrome?”. Kyle was baffled, “What do you mean?”. “Before he passed,”, his mother said, “Your father actually was a reversed person. He used to be another man, who became his cock, and he took over the body. Back then it was a lot more common. My sister, your aunt? She was born a cock, on my brother. They reversed while I was pregnant with you.”. Kyle still couldn’t believe it. More than anything he was happy his mother was so accepting of him.<br />
<br />
“So what you’re saying is, this has happened to our family before?”, Kyle said. “Of course, and it’s not something we are sorrowful, resentful or even remotely upset about. All of our family will still love you. Even if you become my new daughter’s ovaries, you’ll always have my love. I’m proud of you for accepting what you are. You’d be surprised, my sister’s pussy didn’t want to change at first. Now that he’s pushed out a few babies though, he’s been quite the happy pussy.”, his mother responded. Kyle lost himself at the end. The concept of making babies caused him to lose himself to his pussy thoughts for a moment. <br />
<br />
Snapping back to reality, Kyle embraced his mother. “I love you.” “I love you, too.”. Kyle finished the cherry pie with his mother. Enjoying what was their last meal as mother and son. As he left, his mother called out after him, “I can’t wait to meet her! Come see me when you reverse! Goodbye, pussy! I love you!” Kyle felt warm inside. Both from being called pussy, and from the love he could feel from his mom that afternoon…</p>
