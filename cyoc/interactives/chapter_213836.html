<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David Nicolaus Scott the Third managed to get another two hour in nap before waking up to the alarm meant to rouse him for feeding the animals.  The various creatures did not care for the appearance of this wolftaur, but as he was feeding them like a human, and not attacking, well.  Food was food, after all.  Furthermore, they responded better this second time than they did last night.  The whole process took him about an hour as usual.<br />
<br />
I just didn&#39;t want to overlook that this was sill someone else&#39;s ranch and farmhouse with a number of animals needing to be taken care of.  That&#39;s not the focus of this passage exactly, but I thought it was important to remind people.  Life continues, and the passage of time has been a little over half a day thus far with David and Holly&#39;s transformations already slipping off the history of the Emitter&#39;s Revert.<br />
<br />
Dawn had just barely broken and David had taken some time with his phone to measure the break in the fence caused by his impact the previous night using its built-in AR measuring tool.  As he was googling the price of such wood, he glanced as he realized something.  Glancing quickly at us, he two-handed the small device and began tapping with both thumbs.  Changing the Emitter&#39;s default selection to search for objects &#39;within 10 feet&#39; and &#39;fence&#39; he found the broken pieces of it listed there.  Tapping Change, he made them intact once more, though they were still on the ground.<br />
<br />
David had been average strength, previously, and being a wolf likely somewhat reduced that amount as they were built for different things.  Still, whatever strength he had was enough for him to lift one individual fence rail one at a time and slot them back in place of their respective posts.  This didn&#39;t take him long, but it did give him food for thought.  What he wanted to be, this wolftaur, wasn&#39;t refined yet.  It could use some work.<br />
<br />
His current automobile was older now than his very first one was when he&#39;d gotten it in high school.  He had this dark blue Subaru Forester for almost fifteen year and personally added more than half its 350 thousand miles.  While he did need to figure out a way of &#39;driving while taur&#39;, that&#39;s not what he was concerned with at the moment.  Moving to the vehicle, he knelt his front legs down and put two hands under the wheelwell.  He was unable to get it to budge upward, as expected.<br />
<br />
Utilizing his smaller iPhone, he rubbed one hand on his chin as he both theorized and Googled. sHe followed a line of thought:  <i>weighs almost three thousand pounds.  A jack lifts a fourth of that, right?  Seven hundred fifty.  Average untrained human can deadlift 150, which is a sixth of that.</i>. Shaking his head, he looked up at the sky and took a deep breath of the lovely fresh air... way better than the nasty smell back in the neighborhood he grew up in... but he felt more... <i>at home</i> here, now...<br />
<br />
&quot;How much does a gorilla lift?&quot; he asked himself as he opened up a new tab and searched.  A lot more, it turned out... but it had to do with their muscle fibers.  Every animal, it seemed, lacked human level endurance.  Taking a deep breath, David plugged in the Chronivac and invoked a feature he knew about but not yet utilized.  &quot;OK Demi,&quot; he said and a little silver circle appeared with blue markings that might either made very curved horns or a halo—he couldn&#39;t tell which—over its upper portion.  &quot;What variable do I change to increase body strength without losing endurance or growing muscles too big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s what I found,&quot; remarked the little circle, three vertical columns of blue rows of lines appeared when the androgynous voice spoke.  It immediately slid the Chronivac interface to an advanced tab and scrolled downward, highlighting in blue a few possible blanks, many of which having to do with fiber density.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK Demi,&quot; he began again.  &quot;I want to make it so I can lift a fourth of my cars weight, increasing the potential of my muscle increase to four times that, while not raising the floor of my Preset.&quot;  Years of taking with Siri paid off as the screen slid over again, keeping his previous search in mind and basing it&#39;s new modifications to his Wolftaur-DS Preset based upon his request.  &quot;This transAI is scary,&quot; David conceded as he looked over the specific variables that were altering, too many of which he didn&#39;t understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK Demi... these changes will keep the starting potential of my Preset around human strength with the upper potential raised to just above three-thousand pounds?&quot; he asked.  The voice responded positively.  &quot;OK Demi, do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I am unable to enact Changes, only answer questions and suggest alternatives.  All Changes must be executed by outside force.&quot;<br />
<br />
David&#39;s ears flicked towards his phone as the speaker made that remark.  &quot;OK Demi, can anything tapping, clicking, or pressing the buttons for Change cause the change even if they are not strictly living?&quot;  Positive response.  &quot;OK Demi, so if the Emitter fell and struck the ground, it could enact Changes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it hit the primary Change button or one of the ten saved changes, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
David frowned. <i>Dually noted,</i> he thought to himself as he double-checked the changes.  Blinking, he asked a follow-up: &quot;OK Demi.  How strong of a press might break the Emitter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No force inside the universe can break the Emitter.&quot;<br />
<br />
David turned to face me, even though he couldn&#39;t see me.  He still understood I was there and a bigger wolftaur than he was.  &quot;So <i>you</i> might be able to break the Emitter?&quot; he asked, knowing that if I responded, he still wouldn&#39;t hear it.  He realized in that moment at the Emitter could not select itself as it existed up on the cyocLayer, above his universe.<br />
<br />
The wolftaur really wanted to try lifting his car, but something about it felt like preparing for an eventuality that wasn&#39;t needed.  Lowering his lifting amount from 750 down to 250, David kept all the other parts of the Preset.  He wanted to be able to work for a goal, not just get it cheaply.  He wondered if that was weird.  Changing himself into a wolftaur without the Chronivac wasn&#39;t physically possible, but working out and achieving muscle mass was... so he didn&#39;t want belittle that.<br />
<br />
Tapping the &#39;Change&#39; button, David updated the Preset.  Then, tapping it again, he changed his current strength as projected, increasing his base lifting strength to more than double what it had been a moment earlier.  Just for the sake of argument, he tried to lift his car, but couldn&#39;t.  Though... he could feel the tightness in his movement had increased, his broad shoulders a little thicker.  Shaking his head, he wondered if he was going to have to pick up a gym membership... or maybe a personal trainer.  After all, his upward limit of strength now far exceeded any human alive or dead.<br />
<br />
Trotting up the front steps and across the porch, David recalled how Tommy had pointed out his gray fur and possible age.  Opening the front door, he leaned over and tapped the code into the alarm system, then bolt-locked the door behind him.  Holding up his phone, he unlocked it with the passkey and looked over the Chronivac app.  &quot;OK Demi... what is my Preset&#39;s life expectancy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Multiple Presets detected, did you mean Wolftaur DS?&quot; it beeped twice, waiting for a reply.  David responded with a &#39;yes&#39; and the phone acknowledged.  &quot;Current life expectancy based on optimal living conditions of surrounding region as well as animals: human, wolf, centaur, and horse as a hybrid? Approximately 55.4 Earth years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.  I knew I was more than half dead, but being three-quarters dead seems so much closer,&quot; he said without looking at us, just talking to himself.  Looking through the options, he added a 1 in front of his potential lifespan.  He didn&#39;t want to live forever, but 150 years sounded like a good run...<br />
<br />
Moving over to the end table between the two couches, David picked up his coat and moved it to the nearby closet.  Hearing something softly hit the floor, he looked down to notice a tissue box.  Blinking, David shrugged and picked it up, setting back down on the table.  But something about it caught his attention specifically.  He wondered if there was anything else lifespan-related he could alter, and he rubbed his chin while thinking about it.<br />
<br />
As a piece of random trivia, David knew humans were one of only three species on Earth to go through menopause and since he only just recently became able to give live birth and menopause would almost certainly be upon him, he decided to remove that from the Preset.  Checking about estrus, his wolf body was apparently still set to go into heat once a year... and he increased that to six times, essentially having a human period every fifty days or so, with wolf estrus layered within that bleeding period for about the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; David said, glancing towards us.  &quot;This is boring math stuff.  Why don&#39;t you skip ahead?  I wanna breed and be bred, but I don&#39;t wanna wait a year to do it,&quot; he explained with a smirked.  &quot;Nor do I want to just set myself to heat or something.&quot;  He allowed himself a low grumble as he thought of his next point. &quot;Actually, I bet Holly could probably shapeshift and...&quot; he trailed off.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s still sex if <i>she</i> fucks <i>me</i>, so... we can&#39;t do it while Mr. Phillips is still in the picture...&quot;  He trailed off and looked back down at his phone, and I skipped ahead.<br />
<br />
(|[***]|)<br />
<br />
Since Alice and Tommy Phillips had each been to bed after midnight the previous night of &#39;adventures in transformation&#39;, David expected them to wake soon but not <i>too</i> soon.  And, as such, was finally going to take some alone time to explore more of his new body.  He&#39;d been responsible as an adult, but he&#39;d be damned if he wasn&#39;t going to spend some quality time with this form he&#39;d dreamed of having for more than two decades.<br />
<br />
It was 1998 when David first came across a VCL (Vixen Controlled Library) image of one wolftaur with two dicks—not in the same place, mind.  One was at the front like a human, the other at the rear of the wolf body—fucking two different vixens at the same time.  While he&#39;d long since realized he&#39;d prefer no front cock and instead both sexes at the back—perhaps a little &#39;hyper&#39;—the image was still one of the first he&#39;d fapped to as a young, impressionable Furry.<br />
<br />
Heading quietly past the children on all fours, the wolftaur made it beyond the dire wolf cuddling up with her brother and back to his bedroom without incident.  He no longer smelled the sticky &#39;white stuff&#39; and wondered if Alice had licked her brother clean while he slept.  Trying not to dwell on it, or the girl&#39;s red rocket, the wolftaur made it across the basement without hearing the siblings resting heart-rate rise.<br />
<br />
Locking the guest room—his room—door, David took a step away before turning his upper-body back towards the flimsy wooden door and checking the lock twice more.  He&#39;d already had a little bit of an arousal when he caught the scent of Alice&#39;s musk earlier and if there was one thing he didn&#39;t want to do it was give a chance for that big male wolf to get his scent and barge in uncontrollably... even though, even if she were all wolf, he&#39;d expect her to have some restraint.<br />
<br />
David did all those actions I described in previous passages of him getting dressed, but in reverse.  His bed was the same size it had always been, so his body was a little long for it if he was to stretch out.  He didn&#39;t trust himself to one-hand the Chronivac on his phone so he unlocked the wheels on his computer desk and rolled it out from the wall to the bed like he sometimes did while drawing.  From there, he used the broken port on his USB hub to plug in the Emitter like he&#39;d done yesterday which caused the Chronivac application to instantly swap from his phone to the computer.<br />
<br />
Checking the stats of his cock, he notated the different sizes for flaccid and erect.  While David&#39;s previously &#39;perfectly average&#39; five inch penis was gone, he seemed to have more than doubled that to thirteen inches as a result of his wolf-torso&#39;s body size.  Double checking, he was technically 2% Clydesdale there, bringing into stark relief Tommy&#39;s copy-of-a-copy question from the previous night.  Leaning his lower body to the side, David looked at his sheath where his dick was already crowning.<br />
<br />
Pulling his rear end around in a &#39;u&#39; closer to his front with his hands, he placed one padded digit upon the tip of his own cock.  <i>Hm.  I can see why a wolf wouldn&#39;t masturbate with their own paws,</i> he considered, taking in the rough texture of his paw-pad as it touched his length.  <i>Don&#39;t really want to change that.</i>  He sighed.  Then a realization hit him and he almost snapped his fingers before he caught himself.<br />
<br />
Taking one of the empty one liter bottles from the top of the trash bin beside his desk, he quickly found the object with the Emitter.  He removed the cap, then changed it into a solid silicone dildo.  Selecting the dildo, he actually made it slowly change until it was a mirror of his fully erect penis so that he could get a closer look at it&#39;s shape and size.<br />
<br />
Holding the thirteen inch blue length in his hands, David&#39;s arousal increased and he could feel himself getting both hard and wet.  Looking it over, he admired the craftsmanship of the build, though a part of him thought the bulbus glandis at the base, his knot, was actually not as big as he&#39;d like.  Reaching over to the computer mouse, he selected the size and increased it to his liking.  While he was there, he also increased his girth to slightly three inches and made sure he&#39;d had himself selected and not the dildo before hitting the Change button.<br />
<br />
Taking both things into account, David could feel his length growing wider in diameter, but he wasn&#39;t looking at it.  No, as he changed himself, the dildo that was selected to mirror his own maximum shape and size changed shape as well.  <i>That&#39;s kind of hot,</i> he considered as he took the bottle&#39;s cap and made a few quick selections, making it a cap for the dildo, essentially: a pocket pussy.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, he was a little disappointed.  He&#39;d always envisioned a canine cookie to be three plump lips, but his were not that.  Then again, he wasn&#39;t in heat.  <i>But I don&#39;t </i>have<i>to be,</i> he realized.  His arousal died down briefly with the time it took for him to reconfigure his body type so that the lips of his lupine vulva were always apparent, but he did it.  Then, he changed the silicone duplicate so that it mirrored his at full estrus.  With a curiosity of a teenager, David slid one blue sex object into the other all the way up to the knot.  After a few thrusts, he realized the knot wouldn&#39;t quite breach the walls.  <i>Oh, right... wolves lock first, then get fully hard,</i> he remembered.<br />
<br />
<i>I actually kind of love this inane minutia of figuring out this body,</i> he thought, still mindful of the children in the other room.  Rubbing fingers over the little bump atop the more pointed direction of his imitation cunt, David tapped a few entries to slightly increase his clit size as well.  <i>Not to say I&#39;m not gunna try it out,</i> he grinned.<br />
<br />
Kissing the silicone cookie, the wolftaur turned his attention to the fine canine cock before him.  Utilizing his longer than normal, tick pink tongue, David wrapped it prehensily around the dildo, licking it up and down to wet it.  With anticipation, he pulled his head back like he was trying start a lawn-mower with his tongue.  As he softly giggled, he too the blue pointed shaft and slowly downwards toward his wet sex.  Pushing his own hardening red cock out of the way, he pushed the dildo behind his balls and teased the outside of his own plump lips—<br />
<br />
Then the doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
David&#39;s hand jerked and he poked his clit with the blue silicone which made him jerk and shutter a little.  Eyes looked towards me accusingly.  &quot;I thought we were finally doing that masturbation scene,</i> he grumbled, tossing the two sex toys onto the bed and then covering them with his top blanket.  &quot;That doesn&#39;t even make sense... doorbell?  Where was the beep for the comm at the gate?&quot; he asked accusingly.  He tried to quickly put on his underwear all the way tight over his bright red hard-on, but it peeked out just beyond the elastic.  &quot;Wait, is this the PI?  This is the PI, isn&#39;t it?&quot; David asked aloud as he got the second belt of his utilikilt carapace on over his tauric body and shoved the Emitter in one pocket.<br />
<br />
Unlocking his bedroom door, he yanked his currently only form-fitting shirt—the white one with the QR Code printed on the front—off the top of the hamper and moved hastily up the stairs, despite his boner.  Alice stirred briefly as he moved beyond her and Tommy, but the two of them seemed to have slept through the noise.  The first time, anyway.  David was trying to get to the door before a second ring...<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Who is it?&quot;</i> David growled at the front door once he had closed the basement&#39;s behind him.  Pulling his shirt down over his head, he noted one of the tears in the side he got from when his ribs tore out his chest and the blood spatter there.  &quot;Perfect,&quot; he remarked softly as he made a short canter to the front door from the top of the basemen stairs.  &quot;Who is it?&quot; he repeated before leaning forward to look out the peephole.<br />
<br />
Standing on the the opposite side of the door was a white man of muscular build.  He was wearing blue jeans and a red and black flannel shirt over the top of a white wife-beater that had some tan stains upon it.  At his side was Glock 22, and while David wasn&#39;t a gun-nut by any stretched, he recalled having had such a gun pointed at him in the past by an enraged McDonalds co-worker.  He&#39;d quit the job the next day.<br />
<br />
His one eye scanned upwards to see the close-cut beard on the man&#39;s face, surrounding his square jaw.  His head was shaved, and he had an air of imposition about him.  Green eyes stared intently at the door like he expected David to open it which, to be clear, the wolftaur had no intention of doing.<br />
<br />
A gruff voice with just a hint of New England accent came from those thin lips on his face: &quot;We need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
That breath was clearly the scent of a man who&#39;d had had too much to drink, and David&#39;s black wet nostrils wiggled.  The man liked some of the same hootch as his parents did.  <i>What were the odds?</i>  The voice was one he was sure he&#39;d never heard before, but as he listened he picked up other things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you need to see a doctor,&quot; David said flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your heart has a fucky rhythm to it.  I can&#39;t be sure what made it that way, but of all the ones I&#39;ve ever heard, yours is certainly wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you&#39;re joshin&#39; me.  Open the door and let&#39;s talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
David&#39;s golden eyes looked to the security system panel next to the door and the panic button placed there.  &quot;My plan is to not do that,&quot; he said simply.  &quot;You don&#39;t sound like someone here with car trouble, nor looking for directions, but I assure you... <i>you are lost,</i> David growled again.  &quot;Now get off my property before I call the cops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, while it was true the land wasn&#39;t David&#39;s in the legal sense, he&#39;d had past experiences telling him not to assert that.  For one thing, his grandfather had specifically encouraged David to treat the property as his own, to protect it, while he was the only there, which he did.  Secondly, he&#39;d had a Gamestop manage once tell him when someone asked for a manager and no manager was on duty with him, it was him.  Same premise.  This was this wolf&#39;s territory and he was acting as such...<br />
<br />
&quot;This ain&#39;t your property.  I&#39;ve dealt with David Senior and I <i>know</i> his son&#39;s away.  The only person who&#39;d be here with some claim is his grandson, so tell me, David, where are my kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Oh,</i> David thought, looking over at us.  <i>Mr. Phillips,</i> he realized.  <i>You guys know I&#39;m unaware what choice selections you&#39;re making, so if that was clear in the hyperlink, it&#39;s news to me...</i>  Turning his wolfen head back towards the door, David kept up the pretense that he had no idea who the man was.  &quot;Man, I don&#39;t know who you are, let alone your kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Trevor Phillips, and you&#39;ve kidnapped my children Alice and Thomas.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Thomas,</i> David wondered.  It had not occurred to him that &#39;Tommy&#39; was a nickname.  &quot;Look, Mr. Phillips, you&#39;re clearly drunk and armed... neither of which are a good for me, let alone in combination.  If your children were here—and I&#39;m not saying they are—then you&#39;d have told me the safeword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunkin,&quot; Mr. Phillips said confidently, his hand near his gun.<br />
<br />
David didn&#39;t know whose safeword that was, but he remembered telling Holly to give everyone she left with the kids a different word so that if their dad ever tried to pick them up without her, she&#39;d know by the word who tried to make that possible.  Glancing down at his phone, opened the text message app.  &quot;Just a second,&quot; David said, giving himself a bit more time as he sent Holly a message: &quot;Dunkin told their word.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stepping back from the peephole, David moved along the front of the ranch house along where the patio was outside.  All the front windows had their blinds drawn, so the man might not have been able to tell David was no longer at the door as he softly padded across the wood flooring into the kitchen, his claws clicking as he stepped.  Trying to get inspiration for what he should do next, David waffled on hitting the panic button to call the cops.<br />
<br />
<i>Abusive spouse, bald head, Glock 22... oh.  Oh shit.  Tell me he&#39;s not a cop.</i><br />
<br />
In tense situations, David had found that clues could be obvious as to his course of action, but what did he have to work with?  Blinking, David leaned over to one of the windows nearest the kitchen and pulled the curtain just a little to the side.  Out there, parked at the gate entrance, was what Mr. Phillips road in on...</p>
<hr/><h3>
