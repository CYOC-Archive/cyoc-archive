<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Derrick starts growing back to his original height, Tanner decides what he should do with the Chronivac next.  He figured that since he has nothing to do aside from babysitting Derrick considering his friends were either busy or out of town, he would want to make himself Derrick's age.  He keys in to the Chronivac to regress him physically to eight years old, while keeping his mental age intact.  He also sets it so that he would return to seventeen on Monday morning when he wakes up (his parents would return home late Sunday night after Derrick's bedtime).  Double checking what he entered, he also decides that if he likes himself better as a kid, he would always set it so that he would stay as an eight year old longer.  As soon as Derrick returned to his normal height, Tanner hit &quot;Enter&quot;, confirming the changes he had set.<br />
<br />
Before the changes took place, Tanner took stock of his seventeen year old self in the mirror.  “Take one good look at yourself Tanner,” he thought to himself, “Within the hour, this will not be you.  You will be a little kid for the weekend.”  Soon afterwards, he felt his entire body tingle, meaning that the changes were starting; Tanner began getting younger.  &quot;This is it,&quot; Tanner thought, &quot;Getting younger now.  Eight years old again.  Here we go.&quot;<br />
<br />
At first, the changes were miniscule.  His deep stubble began getting lighter.  His body hair started to recede, but not by much.  His muscles started deflating and losing definition.  He also started losing some height, although it was not noticeable.  Soon, his clothes started getting loose on him.  At this point, Tanner looked at himself in the mirror, only to see that he is no older than fifteen, and likely slipping into fourteen.  Most of his body hair and nearly all of his facial hair have now receded.  His pants are now beginning to fall off, so Tanner is now holding them up.  His shirt is also looking big on him, but it’s not bothering him yet.  Tanner also noted that he looks scrawnier as he didn’t start working out as much until before he started high school.  As the changes progressed, Derrick started getting confused as his older brother was shrinking before his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Tanner, what’s going on?” Derrick asked, “You look different.”  “It’s nOTHing DerRICk.  YoU’RE jUST SEEing thINGs rIGHt nOW.  I’m tOTTaly fINE” the now thirteen year old Tanner replied as his voice cracked.  Expecting a nearby shrink spurt, tanner stepped out of his pants, which are now too big for his small waist.  While doing so, his “manhood” was showing.  At this point, there was only a thin wisp of pubic hair remaining on his otherwise smooth body (all other facial and body hair are completely receded).  His penis also shrank dramatically, receding to a mere 2 inches at his current age.  Immediately after that, Tanner started his shrink spurt as he became less than 5’ tall and very scrawny.  He has officially left the tail end of puberty and returned to his prepubescent days.<br />
<br />
“Tanner, I can tell that something is happening, so tell me what’s happening!” Derrick said.  “Oh, something is happening Derrick,” eleven year old Tanner replied, “I’m getting younger.  I used the Chronivac to make me like this.”  “Why?” Derrick asked.  He knew the Chronivac had something to do with it, but did not get why Tanner would want to do that.  “All my friends are out of town and I have to be stuck here for the weekend.  We don’t have anything in common, so I thought that getting myself younger would get us closer” Tanner replied.  “Well you didn’t have to do that,” Derrick replied, “Not that I don’t want you as a kid.”  “I know, but I felt that I was the cause of that problem ‘cause of the stress I’ve been going through recently.  Anyways, the changes won’t take much longer.  I set the Chronivac to make me your age” Tanner replied.  Soon, Tanner began slipping into his single digit years as he got closer to Derrick’s height, and passed it by a few inches.<br />
<br />
The transformation was over.  From Tanner’s shorter perspective, his room looks a lot bigger now.  His now-oversized shirt went down to around halfway between the waist and the knees.  Then, he looked at his updated physical data on the screen:<br />
<br />
SCAN RESULTS:<br />
Name: Tanner William McBeall <br />
Age: 8<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 3’ 9’’<br />
Weight: 64 lbs<br />
Sexual Preference: N/A<br />
Hair color: black<br />
Eye color: blue-green<br />
Occupation: Student; 2nd grade<br />
<br />
There were a few things that appeared to be surprising, but did not faze Tanner.  First of all, Tanner was now a few inches shorter than Derrick, but he had always been short for his age until he hit puberty.  Also, the data stated that Tanner is in second grade as opposed to third, unlike Derrick.  At this time in the year when Tanner was originally eight, he was in second grade.  Afterwards, he looked at himself in the mirror.  He lost over two feet of his old height and two thirds of his old weight.  His body is now void of any hair aside from the top of his head.  He was really eight years old.<br />
<br />
“Holy crap it worked!” Tanner shouted at the sight of his younger body.  “Yes it did.  Good thing mom &amp; dad are out for the weekend ‘cause if they heard you say that at that age, you would have your mouth washed out with soap” Derrick told Tanner, “So, you’re my age now, huh?”  “Actually, you’re just a little older now.  My birthday was last week, so I would have just turned eight.  Yours is in three weeks, and you’ll be turning nine” Tanner replied.  “Are you serious?” Derrick asked, “I’m the older one now?”  “Yep!” Tanner replied, “Eleven months older.”  “That’s awesome!” Derrick replied, “Anyways, I bet you need some clothes that fit you now.  It must be a bit cold to wear just that shirt the way you are now.”  “That would be a good idea bro” Tanner said.  “Ok then, you can borrow my clothes.  I’ll be right back” Derrick replied as he left for his room.  He quickly came back with a pair of shorts, one of his underoos, and a Pok&eacute;mon t-shirt.  “I’ll get changed in the bathroom” Tanner said, “Besides, I REALLY have to go!  I guess my bladder didn’t shrink with my body.”<br />
<br />
After he “went”, he changed into the clothes Derrick gave to him.  To Tanner’s surprise, they fit him perfectly, which feels weird for him as these are his little brother’s clothes.  “This is gonna be fun Tanner,” he thought to himself as he looked in the mirror, “Being a little kid again; the same age as Derrick.  Here we go.”  After Tanner settled in his younger body, he went into Derrick’s room.  “So, now what do ya wanna do “little bro”?” Derrick asked.  “I dunno” Tanner replied.</p>
