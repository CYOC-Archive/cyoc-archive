<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noe gives his family one last hug, before heading off into the wilds surrounding their home. The new hobgoblin eager to convert more humans to his kind, and to give his special someone the love that they deserve. His new larger body doing nothing to slow him down as he traverses through trees and bush. Past the other monsters of the forest who greet him as he moves ahead. Orcs, Bugbears, Minotaurs. It&#39;s so hard for him to imagine that not too long ago he was a human hiding from these creatures. But now he is one of them, another monster ready to remove a humans humanity.<br />
<br />
The hobgoblin continues to follow his human memories. Travelling as close to the village as he can safely reach, before starting to tread the outskirts. In the wilds before the hidden settlement, and searching for the man he loves. Looking around the usual place where he and Denzel would meet. At the large oak in a clearing, where the two would rest against it and talk about the days events. Sometimes embracing each other in a hug, and just enjoying the others company.<br />
<br />
Noe waits and watches, patient as he searches for his prey. Nearly an hour passing before his familiar friend walks out of the woods and towards the tree. The twenty year old thin and lean. Hair short and chin clean. Skin pale and features boyish. Noe&#39;s cock immediately becoming erect as he watches his partner from the shadows. Him starting to sneak forward as Denzel rests his back against the tree. Relaxing in the moment, before being suddenly grabbed from behind.<br />
<br />
Noe moves in an instant, one arm tightly pressed against Denzel&#39;s mouth, and the other holding him tightly against his chest. Denzel squirming and trying to break free, but having no chance against the might of a hobgoblin. Especially a hobgoblin as masculine as Noe. <br />
<br />
&quot;No more of that, Denzel. It&#39;s me.&quot;<br />
His struggles die down slightly, Noe giving him a chance to speak.<br />
&quot;N-Noe?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s me.&quot;<br />
&quot;W-what happened. You&#39;re-&quot;<br />
&quot;A hobgoblin? Yeah, dad made me his kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Denzel freezes up as Noe uses this opportunity to start stripping his partner. Tossing his shirt onto one of the tree trunks before undoing his pants. Throwing them aside with no care before bringing a hand across Denzel&#39;s unimpressive chest. The human letting out a sudden gasp to the affection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Noe.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;W-what are you doing. What are you planning?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he asks that question, Denzel hears a chuckle, and feels something hard rest against his anal entrance. His question being answered as he can&#39;t get out a single sound. Frozen in both fear and anticipation. This is the man he loved, but he&#39;s a hobgoblin now. He&#39;s different, bigger, stronger. He&#39;s a monster that wants to make others into monsters. That wants to make him into a monster. He should fight it, try to get away before it&#39;s too late. But that moment of indecision is enough for Noe to bury a few inches of his dick inside Denzel&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m marrying you, what&#39;s it look like?&quot;<br />
Denzel moans as a few more inches are buried inside.<br />
&quot;Making you a hot hobgoblin. Making you my husband.&quot;<br />
His thoughts melting away as the last few inches find themselves inside.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll love it, Denzel.&quot;<br />
<br />
The human finds himself lost once his partner is fully inside him. Resting back against the hard abs of his lover, and looking into the hobgoblins orange eyes. Noe looking back in turn, the two entirely focused on the other as he lowers himself to bring Denzel into a kiss. Still thrusting his cock into his friends ass as their lips lock. Noe&#39;s hands feeling Denzel&#39;s undefined chest, while Denzel explores the muscled and hardy back of his partner.<br />
<br />
With each second, the two feel themselves approaching their limits. Thrusts now wild and kisses broken for moans. Noe locking his hands around Denzel&#39;s chest, and Denzel gripping onto Noe&#39;s arms as one final thrust is had. With it, fresh hobgoblin spunk is shot deep into Denzel, and Denzel in turn finds his human seed spilling out of his own dick. Wetting the forest floor as he empties himself, and Noe exits his lover. Bits of hobgoblin spunk dripping to the ground alongside the human seed as Noe rests on his back, and pats his sturdy chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mere.&quot;<br />
<br />
He says to the recovering Denzel. The human feeling beyond overwhelmed. Tired and sore, resistance worked out of him as all that remains is a man transitioning to goblinhood. Denzel looking over to his stud of a friend, no, stud of a husband. He corrects himself, knowing that the two are now wed as he willingly walks over, and plants himself on his husbands thick chest. Hands feeling the thick hairs that coat his torso, grasping the tight muscle that makes up this god of a man. Feeling his own body adjust to his new race as he continues to take in the man he is devoted to. Fixated on Noe to the point that he does not notice his own chest gaining muscle. Build not nearly as strong or showy as the other hobgoblins, but healthy like a swimmers build.<br />
<br />
After a few more appreciatory moments, Noe slowly lifts his arm. Exposing his underarm to the forest, and awakening a new hunger inside his husband. Denzel moving forward, crawling up his much larger partners body as he burries nose into pits. Wetting his face with hobgoblin sweat as he takes in the mighty and primal smell of his partner. Digging in further as his skin starts to turn red, tasting the pungent liquid as his ears become pointed. Basking in it all, before he has finally had enough. His new orange eyes looking lovingly to his husband, as the two break into a toothy smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad&#39;ll love you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to meet him, but I need a family of my own.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah? How about we get your some dad&#39;s then?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that, as long as it&#39;s happening with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Denzel rests his head on his husbands pecs. Noe wrapping arms around his lover, keeping his secured and safe. The two besides their favourite tree, and ready to bring the rest of the village into goblinhood.</p>
