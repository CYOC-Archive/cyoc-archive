<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You both swim toward the shore until the sand is just a few feet under you.  After standing up, you both walk out of the water and across the beach.  She hands you your wet T-shirt.  &quot;Do you want this back?&quot;<br />
<br />
You take the soaked shirt and carry it.  &quot;Thanks.&quot;  You&#39;re too distracted by new sensations of your new body to care about your shirt.  With every step, you can feel the weight on your chest move up and down.  You also feel your wet hair sticking slightly to your back and shoulders.  As you move onto the dry sand, you look down at your legs and notice they&#39;re hairless as if they&#39;ve been shaved.  You also notice your crotch looks quite smooth and want to take a closer look, but decide to hold off on that after you spot some kids playing in the sand to your left.<br />
<br />
You looked over at the lifeguard.  &quot;So, I never actually got your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she apologized.  &quot;I&#39;m Jennifer.  Jennifer Cole.  Everyone calls me Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, I&#39;m betting I&#39;m not the first person that&#39;s changed.  How many others have, uh, &#39;decided to become lifeguards&#39;?  ...if you get my meaning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got about fifty lifeguards working this beach.  Most of them are working today.  Roughly half have gone through training like you, so it&#39;s an all-female team.&quot;  She waited until you passed a group of beachgoers and lowered her voice.  &quot;Even the women have done the training, but obviously the changes to them haven&#39;t been as drastic.  Many ended up with a more fit body, but they&#39;ve ultimately ended up looking similar to when they started.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded.  &quot;So did you go through this &#39;training&#39; too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Jen replied.  &quot;And since I&#39;ve helped others train dozens of times before, I can anticipate your next question.  Yes, I was born female.&quot;  The two of you reached the lifeguard station and she held the door open for you.  &quot;Let&#39;s talk more inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the station, you followed Jen over to a desk near the cabinet where she had kept the swimsuits.  She sat behind the desk and motioned for you to sit in front.  &quot;So, I&#39;d imagine you&#39;ve got a million questions.  Seeing as how I&#39;ve guided a couple dozen men through this process before, why don&#39;t I give you the rundown and you can ask any questions at the end when I&#39;m done.  Please be patient and I&#39;ll answer all your questions.  Sound good?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded.  &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
She reached into a drawer.  &quot;Great!  Now, while I explain things, why don&#39;t you get started with some paperwork?&quot;  She pulled out a couple pieces of paper stapled together and grabbed a pen from a mug on the desk.  &quot;If you want to be employed here and get paid, Uncle Sam wants their cut, so this is just some standard government bullshit.  We may have enchanted swimsuits, but even that doesn&#39;t let us escape the IRS.&quot;  She chuckled.<br />
<br />
You smiled and nodded in agreement while taking the form and a pen.  Jen was right, it was a standard W2 tax form, but there was also a form which was asking for personal information for the lifeguard station records...name, address, phone...standard stuff.  You started to fill it out and paused for a moment to look at your hand.  You noticed you had longer fingernails.  They didn&#39;t have nail polish, but your hands looked smaller and it felt different to hold the pen.  After a moment, you started filling out the form while Jen explained things.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I know you&#39;ve already asked, but yes, it is possible for you to change back.  I&#39;m sorry for surprising you with the sex change, but I&#39;ve found that very few guys are willing to join us if we explain in advance what&#39;s about to happen.  When we transform them first, they tend to be a little more curious and receptive to the idea.  You have to admit, if I had asked you to magically change into a woman and join our lifeguard station, you&#39;d have laughed it off and walked away.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded.  &quot;Yeah, I&#39;d never have believed...&quot;  You motioned to your breasts.  &quot;This!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I&#39;ve called the swimsuits &#39;enchanted&#39;, but that&#39;s really a simplification.  They&#39;re made from a special material which, when exposed to cold water with the specific salinity of our bay out here...  Well, we&#39;re not entirely able to explain it with current known science, but basically the material and the bay&#39;s water split Y chromosomes into X chromosomes as if the body has had X all its life.&quot;  Jen paused for a moment.  &quot;I&#39;m a lifeguard, not a biologist, but that&#39;s the short version.&quot;<br />
<br />
You furrowed your brow.  &quot;So how did my hair end up longer and how did my legs and armpits lose their hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen shrugged.  &quot;Best guess is a happy side-effect?  Like I said, our known science hasn&#39;t figured it all out.  However, we do know that if and when you go see a doctor, they&#39;ll think you&#39;ve been female all your life.  They won&#39;t find any evidence you were ever born male.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blinked.  &quot;Wow, you know you could really change the world with this.  So many people out there were born male and would give anything to be female.  Why keep this secret and only use it to transform men to female lifeguards?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen sighed.  &quot;Yeah, see, that&#39;s the other thing...you&#39;re a lifeguard.  That&#39;s another odd side-effect of this &#39;enchantment&#39;.  How many lifeguards does the world really need?  If we let everyone change, we&#39;d have far too many lifeguards.  What did you do for work before this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was an accountant,&quot; you reply.<br />
<br />
Jen nodded.  &quot;So you probably had to file taxes for lots of people, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sure.  April was a living hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So can you tell me what you&#39;d use a Schedule D for?&quot;  Jen smirked and waited for your answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d file a Schedule D when...  Wait, uh...  I&#39;m blanking.&quot;  You tried to recall.  You know you&#39;ve filed hundreds of them, but now can&#39;t even remember what it&#39;s for.  You stared at the ground searching your brain.<br />
<br />
Jen sighed.  &quot;You don&#39;t remember, do you?&quot;  Jen shook her head.  &quot;Yeah, that happens.  When you gain the lifeguard knowledge, a lot of your other professional knowledge is lost.  It tends to be more complicated things not known by most of the general public.&quot;<br />
<br />
You were a little disturbed by the loss of knowledge.  &quot;Oh, wow.  That&#39;s frustrating.  I really don&#39;t remember, but yet I feel confident that I could pull a drowning swimmer to safety as if I&#39;ve done it a hundred times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it can take some getting used to.&quot;  Jen smirked.  &quot;I used to work at the post office.  Now I can&#39;t even tell you the price of a stamp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I change back to male, will I get my accounting knowledge back?&quot;  You thought for a moment.  &quot;...or maybe I could get some other kind of knowledge instead?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked directly at you.  &quot;Well, that&#39;s the thing...&quot;</p>
