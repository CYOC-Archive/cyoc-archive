<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer put on whatever she found and looked the most cleanest on pile. On her way to the kitchen she found it difficult to walk forward and even more slower when coming down the stairs. On the middle step she heard her mother and grandma talking about her as her mother mentioned Jennifer&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry MOM, for the thousandth time, understand that one of my &#39;customers&#39; was so drunk that they didn&#39;t properly dispose the condom used and... and... I didn&#39;t know until she told me about being sick in the morning!&quot; Silvia explained with very annoyed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... ugh... Silvia my sweet little baby girl. I&#39;m talking about your current situation.&quot; The mature voice with a raspy voice replied. &quot;That small potbelly of yours that wasn&#39;t an accident but a... but a...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What Mom!? What IS IT!!!? NGGHH!!&quot; Before her could finish her sentence Jennifer heard a loud smash followed with plates and cup hitting to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweety dear I can hear Jenni coming down the stairs. Try to control your emotion as it scares the child.&quot; The mature voice acted like as if this wasn&#39;t her first time hearing someone shouting at her.<br />
<br />
Somehow this conversation send a shiver down Jennifer&#39;s spine and made her legs tremble as she begun to bowl her tears out. Her mother came to console her as soon as they realized she had been eavesdropping their conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, There. Mommy didn&#39;t mean what she said...&quot; Silvia said as she gave a hug to her daughter.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s anxiety had piled so big that she had to let out the tears out of her system. She only saw glimpses of her grandma as she was five feet behind Silvia&#39;s back. Jennifer wanted to tell her mother how much she hated getting younger and waking up everyday to constant uncertainty. Jennifer was sure that she hand&#39;t done anything wrong and still she failed somehow. BUT she couldn&#39;t say these things out loud and let her emotion do the talking.<br />
<br />
Silvia told her mother that they should just sit in the living room instead.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was emotionally tired all of this but slowly after an hour calmed down as Silvia kept hugging her and telling that everything is okay. Their grandma was also a bit taken by the sudden crying and told her daughter Silvia that they can still live in her house for a half-a-year before they really have to look for a new place.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I ask is that you clean this place up as soon as possible. Even if I live in the neighbour with your father. I still think you should still try and maintain the house. Somehow.&quot; Their grandma explained. &quot;I can see that you have a lot on your plate as well as I do but it isn&#39;t an excuse to pay your side of the rent. Even if your tenant is your mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
In a short moment their grandma left the house and Silvia&#39;s smile just got brighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god for hormones!&quot; Silvia raise her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom..?&quot; Jennifer said as she clearly saw her mother&#39;s attitude changing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thinking. I have tried my best to swindle that old hag away as we got more pressing matters where the money can be spent.&quot; Silvia said as she rushed towards the sofa chair where her mother was just sitting and behind the cushion pulled a very broken smartphone.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was getting worried why her mother was acting like ... like ... just like her...<br />
<br />
A small sweat of dredge went down from her temple. She finally realized that her mother was acting just like her because she was just like her. Difference being she had a baby to take care of while, when Jennifer was 18-years-old, had not. Then another thought bubble popped inside Jennifer&#39;s tiny brain which almost fried it. How big of a age cap they actually had. If she was about twelve to thirteen and her mother was a college senior. That small thought terrified her a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen-ny? Hel-loo? Earth to Jenny?&quot; Silvia croutched and tried to get her daughter&#39;s attention by waving a hand in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. So. Mom said that we have... 3.. 4.. 5... Six months to get enough they money or it&#39;s a kick straight to our asses.&quot; Silvia explained. &quot;Mommy has to do two clients per day as we have some money left to spare but it&#39;s going to be difficult as I normally did this when I had to. So before you go to your room. Remember that Mommy&#39;s bedroom is off-limits from now on. I know how you love to play with the old gamestation but so does my clients AND mommy really can&#39;t afford more unneccesary sick days for her precious daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer could only nod in silence. Her mother smiled and told that she&#39;s going to order them some free pizzas as a late dinner. As she flicked her finger on the very used smartphone. Then she told to Jennifer go to her room to wait and lock the door from her side while ignoring her mom&#39;s &#39;singing&#39; lessons.<br />
<br />
Jennifer slowly wobbled back to her room and inside the room Jennifer almost had a mental breakdown. Only words echoing inside her mind were &#39;oh-my-god&#39; and &#39;no-way-mom&#39; in repeat. She couldn&#39;t trust what she just heard from horse&#39;s mouth. There was no singing lessons or any free pizzas. It only took thirty minutes for the delivery guy arrive and as she listened their conversation. The delivery guy was more than happy to part with &#39;cooled off&#39; pizza for some action.<br />
<br />
Soon enough there were a lot of banging, intense screaming, joyful yelling and lot&#39;s of moaning as her mother cursed like a sailor and announced to the whole house how massive the delviery guy&#39;s cock was. Jennifer wasn&#39;t sure how she was to endure this as the walls were paper thin. <br />
<br />
But something clicked inside Jennifer&#39;s brain. A feeling that she wasn&#39;t familiar to. It wasn&#39;t fear or anxiety but intense excitement. Jennifer&#39;s brain begun to process everything differently as she imagined her 20-year-old self doing the things what her mother did. Jennifer put her left arm on her mouth and carefully inspected the whole room for something longer. A part of her brain wanted to stop the thoughts while other half couldn&#39;t help but think the taboo what she thought about.<br />
<br />
&#39;No&#39;, Jennifer said to herself while putting both of her arms on front her mouth. &#39;I won&#39;t go that low even if...&#39;<br />
<br />
Her mother let out the most horniest and most loudest, &quot;-inside me, NOW&quot; -shouts she&#39;s ever heard.<br />
<br />
A small relapse in Jennifer&#39;s thinking. Laying backsided on the matress her heavy belly pressed the spot on her bladder which shot a small stream left on her system in an arching shower motion all over the floor and the mattress. In Jennifer&#39;s brain she felt as if just had came all over the room as her mother finished with the delivery guy.<br />
<br />
The odor in ther room got stronger while Jennifer tried to hold her tears. She wasn&#39;t sure if they were from the exhaustion, joy, sadness or somewhere in between all of those. Still covering her mouth with both hand she had no time to move herself from lying position as her mother was already knocking on the unlocked door to Jennifer&#39;s room.</p>
