<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emma was 23, just out of College with a bright future ahead of her. She was very smart, always had been, but she’d also always been very pretty. She wasn’t interested in settling down with some guy or girl quite yet, although she never had trouble finding those who wanted her… but it wasn’t for a reason she ever wanted.<br />
Instead of wanting her because of her smarts, her charisma, or her personality. The only thing people ever saw her for were her large breasts.<br />
<br />
The memory was fuzzy, especially since she moved away for college, but she always knew that it wasn’t something that happened with her genes. One moment she had small boobs, the next she had huge ones.<br />
She always hated them as well, they got in the way, they made wearing clothes a challenge, and they always made her look like a total bimbo. Paired with her naturally blonde hair, then best she could do was hope her glasses made her look smarter… it wasn’t too successful.<br />
But in the end, Emma still finished college and was returning to her home town to visit her parents and her brother.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Emma was sat in her car, stuck in traffic. She was barely outside of her old hometown, but was still completely stuck. Of course, she wasn’t going to check her phone, so she started looking around. She recognised the old ‘Pub’ that sat right on the edge of the town. She wasn’t much of a drinker, but did remember her and Rebecca getting very drunk on one particular night there. A good memory to have, considering everything this place was. But whether she wanted to admit it or not, it was home.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of very slow moving traffic, she finally entered the town. It was much more stressful than she would’ve liked, considering the journey and they hassle to get in, so she forgot to admire all of the sights in the town.<br />
As she drove, she had a sudden realisation of where she was. She looked around, seeing an old coffee shop in the middle of the town centre. She’d spend most of her days studying there, being ogled by the customers, the servers, and of course, Jeremy Platesmith. What a total creep… he was always weird, believing all that conspiracy theory crap about curses and magic and… probably aliens as well. Emma was a science girl, she didn’t believe in magic. Who in their right mind would?<br />
<br />
Emma finally drove past the houses. She recognised the house of Rebecca, who she knew moved away a while ago. Her friend Simon’s house, maybe he still lived there, she’d be happy to say hi to one of the few guys who wasn’t always staring at her chest, even if the only reason was that he was gay. More and more houses went past as she rolled through the streets. Then finally, her home.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
“Emily!” Emma’s mother said with cheer as she opened up the door and embraced her returning daughter,<br />
“Hehe, thanks mom,” she said, awkwardly. She wasn’t a huge fan of hugs… for obvious reasons. But she could let this slide, it was her mother after all, “where’s dad?” She asked,<br />
“Oh, he’s in the kitchen,” Emma’s mother said, leading Emma inside. She passed the living room, seeing that the TV was switched off… usually Ryan would be watching something. Guess things might’ve changed over the past few years of being at home.<br />
<br />
“Emma, how good to see you!” Emma’s father said, looking at her up and down, “still as tom-boyish as ever,” he said, chuckling,<br />
“Thank you, dad,” she replied sarcastically, rolling her eyes. She had always had a good relationship with her father, ever since she was younger, “so where’s Ryan?”<br />
“Yes… well he’s out right now,” her mother replied,<br />
“Oh, where is he?” Emma asked,<br />
“Out with…” her mother hesitated, looking to her husband for some kind of support,<br />
“He’s out with his girlfriend,” her father finished, anticipating a rection.<br />
<br />
“A GIRLFRIEND!?” Emma shouted suddenly. She wasn’t much for theatrics, but this felt warranted, “no way, no way!” She said to herself, getting excited,<br />
“N-now don’t be too quick, Emma,” her mother said, attempting to calm her down, “w-we haven’t a-actually met her yet…” she started, watching as Emma’s excitement began to plummet, “so I doubt you’ll be able to… either,” she finished, taking a step backwards.<br />
Emma looked overwhelmingly disappointed. Finally her dorky brother was growing up, and she can’t even see him.<br />
<br />
“What if I go and surprise him?” Emma asked,<br />
“Uhm…” both her parents looked at each other,<br />
“I know this place pretty well, there’s only like three places he’s going to be,”<br />
“R-really?” Her mother said,<br />
“Yeah, and I know exactly where he’s going to be!”<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
“Don’t be too long, honey,” her mother called out, “we want to spend the evening with you!”<br />
“Don’t worry. I’ll be back!” She replied, waving at her parents as she walked down the road.<br />
<br />
Emma was finally back to her roots, walking to meet with someone in the town. She felt a wave of nostalgia, as well as a wave of the cold breeze. Looking down, she realised that her nipples had hardened with the cold. Even through her industrial bra, her nipples always manage to poke through. Not her favourite feature of her least favourite asset on her body. She pulled the zipper up on her coat and continued to walk down the road.<br />
<br />
A few minutes had passed before she saw the houses she passed on the way here. She contemplated knocking on the doors to Simon’s house and Patricia’s house, but decided to save it ‘til later, knowing she would spend too much time talking.<br />
<br />
As she finally entered the town centre, she saw that there weren’t too many people. Granted, it was a cold day and most people were either in school or working. All she saw were the occasional old people and those taking their pets for walks. If anyone was out, they were inside. Emma knew that Ryan would be in the Cafe, as he was too young to be hanging out in the Pub (and it wasn’t his style), and he wasn’t going to be hanging out in the town-centre. She approached the Cafe. Although it was still far away, Emma was reminded of being 16, going down to the Cafe with her friends to talk and chat, sometimes to study together… it was always that weirdo that ruined things…<br />
<br />
Wait… that exact weirdo…<br />
<br />
“Emily?” The odd man said, looking at her in disbelief,<br />
“Jeremy…” she said, almost wanting to grit her teeth. He was a creep and a weirdo, sure, but she didn’t expect to have such a reaction to him. Something about him being there, it filled her with absolute anger… like he’d done something to absolutely ruin her life, but she couldn’t remember what it was,<br />
“Y-you’ve still got… those…” he said, trailing off as he stared at her chest. She looked down, seeing that even under her padded coat he was still staring at them,<br />
“Ugh!” She said, loudly, “you really haven’t changed since High-School,”<br />
“You sure have!” He shouted back, looking proud of himself,<br />
“What’s your deal!” She shouted to him, almost unable to control what she was saying, “you did this to me and now you wanna look so smug!” She shouted, feeling tears beginning to well in her eyes. She couldn’t even remember what she was shouting about, but she was getting emotional about it. Did she really forget something this guy did to her?<br />
“S-so… you remember?” He asked, looking dumbfounded,<br />
“Remember what?” She asked,<br />
“Your tits…”<br />
“Excuse me!?” She said, covering her chest a little, “what are you talking about?”<br />
“That I made them so big, you don’t remember?”<br />
<br />
Emma stood there. She was confused. It was like two halves of her brain was fighting against one another, one knowing some kind of truth, the other being completely ignorant to it. But eventually, there was a victor, and everything snapped into place.<br />
<br />
“YOU!!” She shouted. She stomped towards him. He was beside an alley, so she pushed him into it, now hidden from anyone else. Perfect for when she needed to slap him, “you did this to me!?” She cried, tears filling her eyes, “you ruined my life!”<br />
“Ruined it!?” He said, “I made you actually hot, you psycho bitch!” He shouted. Emma lost it, she pinned him against the brick wall behind him. She wasn’t all that strong, not weak by any means, but clearly a lot stronger than this scrawny little loser,<br />
“How the HELL could you do this to someone!?” She shouted, getting very angry, “and… how..?” She asked, suddenly realising this doesn’t make any sense. She knew it was true, but there was no real way to explain this.<br />
<br />
“You really wanna know?” He asked, looking terrified but… he had a smirk beginning to form on his face,<br />
“Don’t mess with me, Jeremy,” she demanded, pushing him against the wall again, “tell me how you did it. Don’t screw around,”<br />
“Fine,” he said, allowing a smirk to shine through,<br />
<br />
“Transform or Dare?”</p>
