<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning on the Charleston&#39;s second full day in Moon Lake wasn&#39;t as early as the second day, as Karen may have been enrolled, but it would take some time to get her a schedule and give her the opportunity to start attending classes, and more importantly Moe didn&#39;t need to get up super early to go into the police station. However, Moe did get up fairly early having slept well and having plenty that would need to be done. Particularly with regard to getting Moe&#39;s Pizza up and running, but a lot of that decision would have to wait until after Nichole was up, as while the restaurant bore Moe&#39;s name, it had ALWAYS been a partnership.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d just settled down to a bowl of cereal when Nichole came out slowly, rubbing her eyes with one hand and straightening her nightgown with the other. Moe slowly smiled to as she came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, dear,&quot; Moe said to her as reached into a cabinet to grab a bowl for herself, &quot;Sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly well,&quot; Nichole answered, deciding not to mention her dream of herself being a werefox. It was likely nothing, though she was a bit puzzled on that, as she&#39;d never looked at the book that the Town Chancellor had left and she&#39;d never met a werefox, or at least she didn&#39;t think she had. She was certain she hadn&#39;t seen on in their were form.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Moe smiled, &quot;as we&#39;ll have a lot of business to handle today... if we&#39;re to get Moe&#39;s Pizza up and running.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole slowly nodded, remembering the offer that Moe had mentioned the previous night on what he&#39;d found scouting the town for possible locations. A part of her was nervous on that, simply for how much they&#39;d ended up spending moving and starting over again. They had a lot of backed up debt that they&#39;d managed to make the minimum payments on, and she also knew that most banks probably wouldn&#39;t provide much on the way of help for additional loans because of all the stresses they&#39;d had to go through in keeping a small business open. They&#39;d even had to change banks, which wasn&#39;t quite something that Nichole preferred, but banks like Wells Fargo did business across the country and the banks they were most pleased with didn&#39;t do business west of the Mississippi River.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think we&#39;d best settle with the rent to own plan that that agent mentioned,&quot; Nichole sighed, &quot;it&#39;d make the over all loan lower that we&#39;ll have to take out and make things a bit easier...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might mean paying more in the long run, counting interest to the bank,&quot; Moe commented.<br />
<br />
Nichole nodded and sat beside her husband, &quot;True... but we&#39;re already in a pretty tight position as it is. The bank may approve additional loans, but NOT enough to pay off the restaurant upfront. So, in this, if you really want to open Moe&#39;s Pizza here... we&#39;re going to have do something that won&#39;t require as high of an upfront payment... and then hope Moe&#39;s Pizza is a success... a huge success here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe nodded and calmly chewed on his cereal for a few moments. He calmly watched as Nichole made her way around the kitchen to get the milk and then return to the table where she began to pour it into the bowl. He could hear the soft crinkle of her cereal as she did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanted you to be aware on what all the options are before going forward,&quot; Moe told her, &quot;because I know we can make Moe&#39;s Pizza a success. We&#39;ve done pretty good together over the years. Closing the shop has never been because of bad food or badly priced food, you know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Nichole answered, her mind drifting toward the Gambonis, who were the real reason they&#39;d had to run around the country for the better part of the last few years. &quot;Though... Moon Lake is going to be different. Weres might have different dietary requirements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have a pizza place here, already,&quot; Moe answered, &quot;and from what I&#39;ve heard they do reasonably well, but can get swamped at times when there are a lot of orders coming in. So I&#39;m pretty sure they can handle pizza. The big thing might simply be in the toppings. More meat for carnivorous weres and more veggies for herbivorous weres. And with the charm of its dashing cook and his foxy cashier and business manager, Moe&#39;s Pizza will do well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole blinked and nearly ended up pouring milk across the table when Moe described her as &quot;foxy.&quot; Moe had loved her for years, and was never one to shy away from complimenting her when he could. It was something that Nichole generally liked about him and helped keep their union as a happy and pleasant marriage. Though, &quot;foxy&quot; was a new one and one that caught her by surprise given the dream that she&#39;d had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright?!&quot; Moe gasped as he got to his feet as he saw his wife stagger back for a moment holding a gallon of milk in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Nichole managed, &quot;You just caught me by surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
She managed to walk back toward the refrigerator and after placing the cap back on the carton, returned the milk to the fridge. As she shut the door to it, she looked over to Moe who had returned to his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve never called me &quot;foxy&quot; before,&quot; Nichole stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you are clever and cunning, like a fox,&quot; Moe answered, &quot;and to me, you&#39;ve always been the most beautiful woman I know. I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t called you foxy before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole shook her head, but did manage a small smile to him. Particularly when he also smiled to her as well, and she could tell it was a sincere one. The dream was an odd one, and odd that she would dream of herself as a were, and a werefox in particular, but Moe didn&#39;t know that. She was fairly sure that his comment was innocent and that he didn&#39;t mean anything by it. And after all that had gone on the previous day that had continued to show her stresses and uncertainties about Moon Lake, particularly between Karen&#39;s decision to be the family were and the surprise at how calm Moe had been with everything that related to Moon Lake, Nichole wasn&#39;t going to push anything too hard at the moment. There was a lot that she was uncertain with and to a certain extent, she&#39;d still personally believed that Moon Lake&#39;s mandatory were law was not right, but there was some mild accepting on her part that maybe she just needed to know more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I suppose I should thank you for the compliment,&quot; Nichole managed after a few moments.<br />
<br />
Moe smiled in response, &quot;Well... will you want to meet the guy to sign all the appropriate paperwork and the related banking work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I think I can trust you to do what is right in that regard,&quot; Nichole answered, &quot;our accounts are an either or sort of thing with the bank, and... well... I may have some apologizing to do with Francine.&quot;<br />
<br />
To that Moe nodded, as he heard footsteps moving about elsewhere in the house, giving an indication that Karen was up.</p>
