<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leah put down her fork, rather enjoying the curry (Rita sure did like making curry, it seemed), before putting her thoughts into words. She had put quite a bit of thought into it, and thinks Rita would even appreciate the cleaver solution she came up with. Before she can open her mouth, however, a sickly gurgle in her stomach gave her an immediate overwhelming sense of nausea. A burp burst out her throat, causing her to cover her mouth with a blush.<br />
&quot;Umm, excuse-&quot;<br />
Before she could even apologize, a long, violent, wet fart exploded out of her, lasting a whole three seconds before petering off. Leah felt her whole face erupt a bright red, too flustered to talk even as the rancid scent of her flatulence settled into the room.<br />
&quot;I am so so sorry, Rita. I *urp* I swear, I have no idea where that came from!&quot; Leah pleaded, trying to wave the smell away while also covering her mouth. Where had this gas come from? It felt as sudden as her accident earlier that day.<br />
&quot;Oh, do you have to go potty Leah?&quot; Rita asked with concern, as if that&#39;s an entirely normal thing to ask a teenager.<br />
&quot;What? No, of course n-*urrp* ugh, of course not! I just-&quot; Her words were interrupted once again from a greasy rumble turned wet fart. It had ripped straight through her, bypassing her control she usually relied on; loud, uncontrollable bursts of flatulence in public are the greatest fear of any teen, leading to many to subconsciously develop skills and techniques to avoid such scenarios--Leah was no different. The fact that this gas is bypassing those defenses through sheer force almost debilitated her through sheer helplessness. It reminded her of a particularly traumatic experience she had in school once where-<br />
Leah blinked, and looked down at her plate of half eaten curry while stifling another burp. Sure, curry can cause gas, but to this level?<br />
&quot;Um, Rita?&quot; Leah asked just as a particularly gut wrenching fart forced her to scrunch her face in effort, &quot;What ex-*urrp* exactly in this curry?&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, beans, a bit of garlic, turmeric, lots of grounded prunes, ginger-&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, what? Did you say prunes?&quot; Leah asked in panic. At least that explained it: Leah was INCREDIBLY sensitive to prunes. The last time she ate them was for a dare, where she downed a whole bag. She was fine the first day, but then became a gassy mess the next. She broke wind so many times during class--sometimes interrupting teachers mid speech--that the day was only half over before she retreated to the nurses office and went home for a &#39;medical emergency&#39;. She left school with skid-marked panties, and had the runs for a week; people didn&#39;t stop mocking her for months. That was all from one bag. If she&#39;s been eating this curry for the last few days...Leah gulped. No wonder she had an accident, she&#39;s surprised she hadn&#39;t blown up earlier!<br />
 &quot;W-Who puts p-*urrp* p-prunes in c-*urrrrrpp* c-curry?&quot; Leah grunted, a trio of farts blasting through her ass, and leaving a little bit something extra behind. The gas was starting to make speaking more difficult, as little burps keep interrupting her speech. She&#39;s never been this level of gassy before, and wasn&#39;t quite sure how to deal with it.<br />
&quot;I read it helps with digest health in children. Leah, are you sure you don&#39;t need to go potty?&quot; Rita asked in concern, waving the air around her in disgust. Leah would roll her eyes if she weren&#39;t so busy trying to hold back her gas; of course she does something like that, leave it to Rita to try and make a teenager &#39;regular&#39;.<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m fine! Just *urrp* I&#39;m j*urrrp* just really sens-*grunt* sensit-*grunt*.&quot; Leah tried to say through the burps and gas cramps, gripping her stomach as she felt something inside her shift. When the cramps ease up, Leah takes the chance to finally finish her sentence, &quot;It&#39;s just that prunes give me really bad-&quot;<br />
Words die in Leah&#39;s throat as another sensation catches her dead in her tracks: in trying to push out a fart, she instead found a very different something pushing out of her, and now semi-solid mush was filling her diaper. She was so caught off guard that she froze, allowing her body free reign. By the time she caught herself and stopped the flow, it was too late--she could feel from the sagging weight hanging off the books lifting her up, that a large amount of poop had already escaped. She subconsciously reached back to feel her diaper, and felt color drain from her face at the size of the squishy bulge.<br />
&quot;-gas?&quot; Leah whispered to herself, almost as if to ask her stomach to clarify: did she just over trust a fart?<br />
&quot;Oh, Leah, you didn&#39;t!&quot; Leah cringed as she realized her accident wasn&#39;t private--the sound, the smell, the look...there was no way Leah could hide what she just did. Rita looked equal parts concerned and disappointed as she stood up and walked towards her step-niece.<br />
&quot;I thought you were more mature than this, but apparently you can&#39;t even recognize when you need to go potty?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, no, you don&#39;t understand!&quot; Leah pleaded, standing up to confront Rita, &quot;I don&#39;t usually have accidents like th-*urk*&quot; As if to prove her wrong, standing up immediately lead to her depositing more mess into her diaper. She caught herself this time, shortening her leak significantly, but the lapse was unmistakable. Rita&#39;s eyes narrowed.<br />
&quot;Leah, if someone told you they didn&#39;t need to go potty, and then immediately goes potty in their pants, how would YOU react?&quot; Rita gave a sigh, pinching the bridge of her nose in annoyance before pinching her nose in disgust, &quot;*Huff*, it&#39;s clear that you aren&#39;t just having accidents. I&#39;m starting to wonder if you&#39;re potty trained at all!&quot;<br />
&quot;Aunt Rita, please, you *urrp* you don&#39;t understand!&quot; Leah pleaded, half realizing how whiny she sounded, &quot;It&#39;s the prunes! They really m*urrrp* m-mess with my stomach!&quot; <br />
&quot;Leah, I&#39;ve been eating the same curry. It might give me the toots and an extra large bowel movement, but I can clearly hold it.&quot;<br />
&quot;B-but I *urrp* I-I *urrrp*&quot; Leah paused as more gas kept escaping her, letting an extra squeaky fart bubble out of her, &quot;It&#39;s extra bad for me! It&#39;s hap-*urrp* happe-*urrp* ugh, happened befo-*urp*-fore! I sw-*urp* swear, Rita, if it w-*urrrp* weren&#39;t for the *urrp* the curry, I&#39;d be *urrp* be *urrrp* b-b-*urrrp* *urrp* *urrp*&quot; Leah found herself lost in a row of tiny belches, rolling out of her throat without a care. She gripped her stomach in pain, feeling like an overinflated balloon that just couldn&#39;t release. She &#39;eeked&#39; as she was suddenly picked up, causing a particularly loud gush of poop to enter her diaper.<br />
&quot;Oh, goodness gracious!&quot; Rita shouted in disbelief as she held Leah in one arm and patted her back with the other. Wondering what on earth the older woman was doing, Leah felt the patting push a large bubble up her throat, and out as a truly impressive belch that would make a frat boy blush. Flustered by her unfeminine action, she didn&#39;t get much time to catch her breathe before another exited, followed by another. She could do nothing but lay there on Rita&#39;s shoulder, embarrassed and disgusted as she continued burping uncontrollably. So focused that she failed to recognize her diaper expanding, both in the back and the front as her bladder and bowels emptied. After 10 straight seconds of burping, Leah finally emptied out, her face somehow a deeper red than before. Was...was she just burped? She was placed back on her feet, too flustered to react.<br />
&quot;There, feel better?&quot; Rita asked, as if burping a teen was entirely normal. Much to Leah&#39;s extreme embarrassment, she DID feel much better, only now realizing just how much pain and pressure she was feeling. She almost didn&#39;t notice she was still pooping herself until a noisy fart alerted her. She immediately clenched again, noticing how it took far greater effort than before.<br />
&quot;Look, Leah, even if prunes give you major stomach problems, that&#39;s still no excuse. If you really were potty trained, you should&#39;ve known you had to go long before the point of desperation you&#39;re currently in. Yet, even when it was obvious to me you were about to go poopy and asked you if you had to go to the potty, you still didn&#39;t know. I bet you didn&#39;t even realize you just wet yourself!&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s eyes widened, and she immidiately looked down to see...oh wow. Her diaper was filled to the brim. And there in the front was a massive yellow stain, expanding the diaper quite extensively; she must&#39;ve flooded it. <br />
&quot;I knew it!&quot; Rita shouted in angry triumph, making Leah realize her mistake, &quot;Not only that, but if you were potty trained even a little bit, you should be able to hold it enough to get to a bathroom. Something, I might add, you did not even attempt to do. And from how tense you are, it looks like you&#39;re barely able to hold back. Why stop now? Clearly, you won&#39;t make it to a toilet!&quot;<br />
Leah whined at the accusation, realizing that she&#39;s right; it was taking her all to keep everything back up, and was putting her in incredible pain. She wanted to bite back against Rita&#39;s clearly flawed view of child development, that this is all just a unfortunate set of circumstances, but found she...couldn&#39;t really argue back. She SHOULD have known her stomach was messed up, but didn&#39;t even after she pooped herself the first time; it really did take her farting loudly to fully realize how bad she needed to go. Except...even then she didn&#39;t, she honestly thought it was just bad gas. She heard Rita asking her &#39;if she needed to potty&#39; as an indignity, honestly believing she just had an embarrassing case of the toots. And even THEN...when Leah thinks back to her previous prune experience, she knew since she woke up that her stomach was going to cause problems, feeling miserable throughout the day. And when she blew up in class, it was only after holding back gas for 10-20 minutes before she was overwhelmed. She also ended the day with only skid marks, and never failed to make it to the toilet when she had the runs afterwards. Now? A grumble tour through Leah&#39;s defenses like wet paper, another surge of poop exiting with a sputtering fart. She tried to hold her flow of gas, focusing in on her stomach and bowels to feel when the next toot would come. The fart still surprised her, but she tried her best to control it. Usually, she would try and release farts silently by controlling how much came out with her butt. All that nuanced ass control seemed incredibly distant, however, when instead of tapping the pedal she floored it, letting another embarrassing, loud, nasty fart splurge out. She wasn&#39;t sure if more poop came with it or not--she honestly didn&#39;t really care at that point. Even if prunes are mostly to blame, and she never experienced eating this many before, she realized that she might be lacking control she had only a few months earlier. Leah suddenly craved that pacifier again, feeling it&#39;s weight in her pocket.<br />
&quot;Do you have anymore?&quot; Rita asked sternly. Leah wanted to say no, but if she&#39;s being honest she&#39;s not quite sure. Still, realizing there was really no point in holding back, she pushed. An explosion of feces and flatulence filled the next 2 minutes, embarrassing Leah further with just how much was left. By the end, she had an incredibly full diaper to an extent she didn&#39;t know was possible, and a feeling of relief that made her realize just how absurdly backed up she was. She waved her behind back and forth, feeling the heavy weight that came with it. There was a strange novelty to it, having such a packed diaper, all that was inside her now pushing out her underpants like a stinky thorax.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re done. Good. Let&#39;s get you changed, and then we can discuss your home situation.&quot;<br />
Leah was brought out of her strange reverie as Rita came to pick her up. She backed up, holding her hands up.<br />
&quot;I can walk on my own, thank you.&quot; She stated, half for her own dignity (or what&#39;s left of it), half cause...she kind a wanted to know what it&#39;s like walking around with the diaper. It was curiosity more than anything else, an she might as well get something out of it. Rita huffed, but let it be as they moved towards the changing station. Leah felt her heart beat speed up as her accident really weighed on her. It obvious that she currently couldn&#39;t control herself, that much she could admit. But once she worked the prunes out of her system, would she go back to normal? Because she was starting to get worried that she might be losing her potty training. The thought made her shudder. Figuring now was better than later, she pulled the pacifier out and plopped it in her mouth, already feeling the calming effect as she walked after Rita. As she did, she paid extra attention to her walk. The filled diaper forced her legs apart, and the mess felt pretty icky and gross. Still, when she leaned into the waddle, she got her messy diaper to wave behind rhythmically, letting her swing her legs wide into a silly march. It was...kind of fun? She really wasn&#39;t sure she should question it, given the events of the day: might as well have something good come out of such a disaster. The two made it to the station, with Rita raising an eyebrow being the only reaction to her silly march and pacifier. Leah was glad for that at least. If her diaper didn&#39;t feel and smell disgusting, she kinda sorta maybe would want to keep it on a little longer? She finds moving around in it strangely fun. But that would be silly, and she&#39;s not actually enjoying the diaper in any way because that would be absurd. As she moves to hop onto the changing table, a little toot followed by a log unexpectedly exits. <br />
&quot;Oh, it sounds like you&#39;re not done. Well, no sense in changing a diaper twice. Go ahead and try and empty yourself, and I&#39;ll tell you about your new babysitter.&quot;<br />
Leah ignored the weird sense of joy at being in the diaper a little longer before the words caught up to her and smashed her out of her trance. <br />
&quot;Wait, babysitter?&quot; Leah asked after ripping her pacifier out, &quot;I thought you said that I-&quot;<br />
&quot;Honestly, Leah, I don&#39;t think I can trust your decision. You&#39;re obviously not the level of maturity I thought you were, so I might as well put you with someone that can take care of you. My neighbor babysits part time, and knows how to change diapers, so I trust them enough to watch over you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Rita, I can change myself-&quot;<br />
&quot;Like I&#39;d trust you to do it? Please, I would like to avoid messes in my house. No ma&#39;am, you&#39;re going to have someone who knows what they&#39;re doing change you.&quot;<br />
&quot;But Rita, that&#39;s not fair! Honestly, I think my idea might-&quot;<br />
&quot;Nope! I&#39;m afraid this is not for discussion!&quot; Rita &#39;hmphed&#39;, as if ending the conversation right there. Leah sighed in defeat, sad that her well thought out plan would never see the light of day. Staying with a stranger who will change her diapers for the next few days sounded absolutely miserable, especially since Rita didn&#39;t seem to really understand that teens shouldn&#39;t be diapered and how awkward getting changed like that would be. She stood there, waving her diaper behind her while sucking her pacifier as she thought it over, and came to a regrettable conclusion.<br />
&quot;Rita, could you at least make them think I&#39;m a toddler? I can play the role, I just don&#39;t want anyone to know that it&#39;s...well, a teen in diapers. Please?&quot;<br />
Leah hated to do it, already feeling too infantile already. However, she knew she was good at playing the role of a baby, and she much preferred someone to treat her like a normal toddler over a weird, diapered teen. Rita stared at her long and hard before letting out a sigh.<br />
&quot;I suppose that&#39;s alright.&quot;<br />
Leah let out a sigh of relief. She felt her guts twitch, and feels another fart exit with a quacking noise. Leah just squats and pushes, long past any shame in filling her diaper anymore.<br />
&quot;So who is it anyways?&quot; Leah asked as Rita dialed the number.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...&quot;</p>
