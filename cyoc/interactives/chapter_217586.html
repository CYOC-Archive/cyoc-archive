<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sat on the edge of the bed in the mostly dark and completely unfamiliar room. There was enough moonlight trickling in through the window that you could still just make out the shapes of the furniture around you. For some reason you couldn&#39;t bring yourself to try to leave, maybe it was shock, or maybe...<br />
<br />
You raised your hand and touched the collar around your neck, for the first time really feeling it. It felt like it was leather, but try as you might you couldn&#39;t find a clasp. You felt the ring that the leash the lion escorted you on attached to, but it was the only feature on the otherwise solid collar. You stuck two finger between the collar and your neck and yanked, only giving yourself a sore neck for your troubles. Grabbing it with both hands your tried to yank it apart with all your strength. You were no slouch, you hit the gym regularly, played sports all through high school, but all the muscles you had built up during your teen years and even into adulthood did nothing but strain uselessly against the loop of leather around your neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on. Just stand up and walk out.&quot; You muttered under your breath, but you kept hearing Sammy&#39;s voice echoing in your head, telling you to go to sleep. Instead of standing you laid back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. It really was quite comfy, and it had been such a long day. Sleep would be good, it&#39;d be easier to figure out a plan to get away tomorrow, with your mind fresh. You thought about the kid in the picture, though would have been what? Seven years ago, you wondered how he would look now but could only bring up Sammy in your mind. Before you knew it, you were drifting off to sleep thinking of fluffy humanoid bunnies.<br />
<br />
You woke to a furry paw hand on your shoulder gently shaking you awake. The smells of cooking food reached your nose as soon as sleep left you. &quot;Wake up.&quot; Sammy said softly. &quot;Eat and shower. Then put on the clothes I left out for you and wait here.&quot; He pointed at a door off to the side of the room. &quot;The bathroom is through there. Food is on the desk.&quot; The rabbit was practically vibrating from excitement, his nose and ears twitching. He was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt today, a puff of white fluff sticking out the open top few buttons, he was holding something in his hands, rubbing it between his fingers. It looks like some kind of coin. Even though he was a bit shorter than you, his grip on your shoulder was gentle but firm. The bunny&#39;s strength surprising you. Guess you couldn&#39;t work manual labor like farming without some physicality.<br />
<br />
Sammy practically bounced out of the room. Once more you thought of trying to leave, but the food smells wafting from the desk had your stomach rumbling. You hadn&#39;t eaten since before you were captured after all. If you were going to make your escape, it&#39;d be best to do it on a full stomach. Standing up, you walked over to the desk and sat down in the chair. The plate on the desk was loaded with eggs, a few slices of toast, and a pile of hash browns. You started shoveling the food into your mouth with the fork that had been left next to the plate. As soon as you tasted it, your hunger multiplied and in a few minutes you had completely cleared the plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now it&#39;s time to go.&quot; You said to yourself firmly as you stood up and began to strip out of your borrowed pajamas. Placing them on the edge of the bed you walked right into the bathroom, Sammy&#39;s words still echoing in your head. It was like as long as those words were there in your mind you had to do what he said. The water did feel good running down your skin, and the soap smelled rich and woodsy as you diligently washed off both your hunting trip and those slave auction quarters. Your hand slipped down between your legs, grabbing your cock. The thing the lion had showed off to all those animal people, your pride and joy, and probably the reason you sold for so much. The thick ten incher you were blessed with, at least when hard, not that it wasn&#39;t impressive soft. Even with your hand around your cock you stayed soft.<br />
<br />
You wondered what your new master would be like. Probably some slim twink of a bunny. Maybe he&#39;d enjoy riding your cock. Sammy was certainly eager to buy you once you had been put on display. Maybe he knew his son&#39;s tastes. You&#39;d never been with a guy before, but it seemed that was to be your lot now. You wondered if your girlfriend even noticed you were missing, or your dorm mate back at your own college. You didn&#39;t even know how long you were out after getting caught. With sigh you let go of your still limp cock and let it flop against your thigh.<br />
<br />
You stepped out of the shower and toweled yourself dry. True to his word there was some clothing waiting for you back in the bedroom. Well, a piece of clothing. A pair of sparkly blue shorts that would be quite snug on you, and would hide basically nothing. There was nothing else. No shirt, no underwear, just the shorts. You slipped them on then sat back down on the bed, staring at the door.<br />
<br />
Why? Why were you going along so meekly. You wanted to fight, but every time you thought of it, you heard Sammy&#39;s instructions echo in your head and you just went along with it like it was your own idea. As you once more tried to summon the will to stand up and leave you realized you heard voices outside the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t need to get me anything for my birthday, pa.&quot; Came a voice as soft and gentles as Sammy&#39;s, though a slightly different timbre, maybe a little deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s an important one. And you just graduated, too. So, I thought I&#39;d spoil you one last time.&quot; Sammy&#39;s voice was practically quivering with excitement. &quot;Before you went off and got yourself some job in the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, pa, I wanted to talk to you about that..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Later. We can talk later, I want you to see your present. Go on, it&#39;s waiting for you.&quot; The door opened and you caught the first sight of your new master. He had certainly grown from the young bunny in the portrait. He was the same height as he father, several inches shorter than you. His fur was a bit shorter, and a silvery grey instead of white. He was also noticeably fit. Wearing only shorts and a tank top, you could see the muscles that made up his arms and chest. He wasn&#39;t bulky, but he definitely wasn&#39;t the scrawny twink you were expecting.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you realized he was taking you in at the same time you were looking him over. &quot;A human? Pa!&quot; The younger bunny turned on the elder, his ears up and quivering. &quot;He must have cost a small fortune, look at him.&quot; For a moment you got excited, maybe he was going to reject you, let you go, you could go home.. &quot;He&#39;s amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I wanted to spoil you one last time.&quot; Sammy pulled out a small box and handed it over. &quot;His control tag. I had to use it a bit to keep him here, but I didn&#39;t imprint him. He&#39;s all yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The younger rabbit opened the box and pulled out a small metal disc with a ring. You recognized it as the thing Sammy had been holding earlier when he woke you up. &quot;My name&#39;s Zane.&quot; The rabbit said, holding the metal disc between his fingers. &quot;You can call me Zane, or master. Now, what should I call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name&#39;s..&quot; You started to speak, but Zane put a finger against your lips and silenced you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. Forget whatever you were called before. I&#39;m going to name you.. Jack.&quot; The rabbit grinned almost devilishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t that the name of your imaginary friend as a boy?&quot; Sammy said from the door.<br />
<br />
Zane nodded excitedly. He reached forward and took your collar in his other hand, and you could feel him hanging the disc from the ring on your collar. You felt a tingle pass through you as soon as he did. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Zane asked after releasing the collar, looking at you expectantly.<br />
<br />
You opened your mouth to give your name, but your mind blanked on you, the only name you could bring up was, &quot;Jack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He also came with two free modifications, if you want. You can take him downtown later and get those.&quot; Sammy was saying, still beaming like a proud papa. &quot;You&#39;ll need to pay for any more beyond that yourself. I&#39;ll leave you two to get acquainted. You uncle and cousin are coming over for dinner tonight to celebrate, so be sure you&#39;re here by 6. I&#39;ve still got some work out in the fields today, so take it easy, go out, it&#39;s your choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, pa.&quot; Zane stroked the back of your neck and at first you wanted to jump away, but it felt so good you found yourself leaning into it, both horrified by your response, and pleased. As the door closed behind Sammy, Zane stepped away to get a better look at you. &quot;Now. What should we do?&quot;</p>
