<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juanita so hoped that the other Managers didn't get involved. There were far too many <br />
'quick fix schemes' that could back fire in a situation like this. At least since the other <br />
Managers had left her with the task of working directly with the park guests, she would <br />
have complete authority of the situation for now. She knew Hannah was ideal when Juanita <br />
met with the doe. Hannah had common sense, self control, self respect, enjoyed her new <br />
self, wasn't ashamed of it, and still wanted to do something with her life as a fellow <br />
member of civilization. Juanita honestly believed Hannah could be the one. Hannah's new <br />
X chromosome wouldn't get nearly the attention as her new species would. <br />
<br />
However, when a thirty year old man, and a disfigured fifty year old man, came out as a <br />
anthro vixen and sage and a teenage couple to boot, this would get people's attention, it <br />
would be 'fountain of youth.'  Truly, after figuring out how to change, rearranged, and <br />
alter DNA, the RNA wasn't that impossible. <br />
<br />
Many of the Management feared the 'age regression' option was a mistake, that it would <br />
muddy the waters, and people fearing an immortal class of the rich would push it back, <br />
and the non-age altering DNA secret along with it. <br />
<br />
Juanita also knew it would destroy the foxes to have made to go back into his disfigured <br />
and elderly form now. Juanita knew this wasn't just about the foxes, or the Managers own <br />
plan to have anthros be assimilated into society. She knew what happened soon between <br />
herself and the foxes, would set many precedents for all guests to come. <br />
<br />
What SHOULD be the price for agelessness, heck, for a second go at life? For a third go? Or <br />
a sixteenth go? Juanita felt a headache coming on. <br />
<br />

<br />
Naomi found herself once again forced to interact with the park guests, or leaving guests <br />
in this instance. She also had enough self control not to look at anything on Jasmine <br />
besides her face, true, they were all naked anyway, but she didn't want to get things side <br />
tracked by making Jasmine feel uncomfortable. Mike of course, stayed politely close to <br />
Jasmine. <br />
<br />
Given the slight hiccup this gave the system with the teenagers' request, Laura was still in <br />
her fox form. She also wanted to be there for the teens when they met with management <br />
least they agreed to something they shouldn't. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Management would like to speak with you personally about your request to keep your <br />
DNA and RNA altered after formally leaving the park.&quot; Said Naomi repeating her given <br />
lines. Then, &quot;For what's it's worth, I suppose your decision.&quot; Naomi said personally putting <br />
her paw on Jasmine's shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Er, thank you.&quot; Jasmine said politely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you doggies understand this sort of thing.&quot; Mike said humorously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Naomi said to Mike as politely as she could. Though he didn't act the rigid, narrow <br />
minded, blind, stubborn old men she was used to thinking of in his context. Naomi <br />
shrugged it off as an except to the rule.<br />
<br />
While going down one of the many, identical, featureless smooth unnatural hallways, the <br />
foxes huddled slightly together to form a unified front, though knowing it wouldn't do <br />
much to someone with the money and power to aid in creating this park in the first place. <br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations by the way.&quot; Said Naomi to Laura, &quot;You're the first non-humans besides <br />
us huskies to see this part of the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
'At least,' Laura thought, 'that means the Management isn't shoveling us through the <br />
system.' <br />
<br />
'Human', Jasmine did her best to remember precisely what a human even looked like! It <br />
had been so long. HAD it been so long? She wasn't sure. She knew only by the time their <br />
vacation was supposed to end how long they had spent in the park. Having been in the <br />
park even longer than Laura and Jasmine, Mike found the task of remembering the precise <br />
details of their original species more daunting. <br />
<br />
The huskies were actually now discussing setting up a photo gallery for the looks on park <br />
guests' faces when they realized the monkey morph they were looking at -was- human. <br />
All in the name of good and harmless fun of course! <br />
<br />
Soon enough, the foxes and husky were at the place of destiny, the secondary office of the <br />
mysterious 'Miss J.'  <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Since Maggie didn't enter the park at one of the standard times, she was totally missed by <br />
Hannah. Which was likely for the better, since Hannah might have mistake Maggie's <br />
intense mood for a disgruntled male. And Maggie was in no mood for being mistake for a <br />
male.<br />
<br />
She also slipped though the news hounds' net by the same virtue. <br />
<br />
Maggie, while still annoyed at her nakedness, (rather than ashamed or embarrassed like <br />
most first time park goers), had more important things to think about, like her son. There <br />
was one thing Grizzly bears were known for, and that was 70% of fatalities involving <br />
grizzly bears came form a mama bear wanting to protect their young! While Maggie didn't <br />
know this figure, this base instinct proved to be very good new best friends with her <br />
personality. <br />
<br />
She didn't know what species her son would be here, (the idea he had changed genders <br />
and ages never entered her brain), but she knew the rest of his collage buddies were here <br />
also, so, it should be a simple matter of asking around until she found him. The park itself <br />
was gigantic. But she was nothing, if not determined. <br />
<br />
From the introduction video's explanation about sex, she just hoped she didn't run into a <br />
'Yogi the Bear' before she found her son. After all, she was already a mama bear, she <br />
already had a cub, a cub who was lost to her, and she intended to find him!  After all, he <br />
was her son.<br />
<br />
So driven by her own desire to remind her son about reality, and her new instincts, Maggie <br />
felt her quest to find her son with new intensity. <br />

While Keith begrudgingly couldn't argue against Jackie's logic of staying -relatively- active <br />
during her early stages, that didn't mean he couldn't conspire to keep her distracted and <br />
out of harm's way. With no television, this required some actual imagination on his part.<br />
<br />
While the lack of mass media did stack the odd against him, there were other less hypnotic <br />
means of entertainment to keep Jackie from over exerting herself.<br />
<br />
This included: Monty Mongoose's conspiracy theory seminars, (absolute torture), and the <br />
daily meeting of the news hounds.<br />
<br />
There was a theory among some Americans that the whole reason England kept the royal <br />
family around was because they made a better soap opera than anything on American <br />
television.<br />
<br />
While there was no way Keith could get Jackie (for now) to forgo her stubborn desire to <br />
continue to hunt in spite of her load, he was able to come up with one thing to keep her <br />
relatively distracted and from over exerting herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;And just last week, there was an incredibly rain and wind storm in California, thousands <br />
were left without power.&quot; Explained the hound dog to Jackie about the current events she <br />
had missed since coming into the park. <br />
<br />
Curiosity killed the cat, and while it didn't stop Jackie from hunting, it did fill up her day, <br />
listening to the latest global gossip. Plus... maybe there were a few drama students and <br />
stand up comics among the park goers. They seemed to have people from -all- walks of <br />
life after all. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Leticia thought of her husband, and their child. And wondered, how much of their <br />
attraction was the instincts talking? She wanted to ask Jeremy THE question. True he had <br />
gotten much bolder and confident about such things since they had first met, but there <br />
were a few things that had a habit of slipping his mind. So it might come down to her to <br />
ask that question. But should she? How long had they known each other? How much did <br />
they know about each other? Could she risk it? Though the fawn inside proved that she <br />
was indeed past the point of no return with him. <br />
<br />
Still, she had another half on the other side, whom her relationship had never been bad <br />
with, let alone abusive, who she had no way to let know she had found someone else. She <br />
felt she owed it to her, to at least let her know somehow, before asking Jeremy the biggest <br />
question of her, and his life. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, ya hear.&quot; Robbie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear a lot.&quot; John replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny's got a new -fawn-! And it's Spike!&quot; <br />
<br />
John glared. &quot;You gotta be kidding me! That's not funny Rob!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not joking! Looks like the park owners finally decided what to do with him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I can't say it isn't an improvement then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robbie sighed.  &quot;Looks like I owe you some bark, I was sure he was gonna come out a <br />
doe.&quot;<br />
<br />
John moaned. &quot;You and your does.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, the point IS, Boss-man Jeremy himself said anyone who lays a finger on Spike, heck, <br />
ANY Fawn, is in for it from Boss-man Jeremy PERSONALLY!&quot;<br />
<br />
John felt scared by the very idea, &quot;Whao... ya don't... ya don't think ... that maybe... Boss-<br />
Man Jeremy could be... still loyal to that walking set of antlers?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;I don't think so.&quot; Robbie said, &quot;I think it was cause Jenny asked him nicely!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Boss-Lady  Leticia didn't get jealous?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no, I know it sounds weird but Jenny didn't ask nicely THAT way, she just asked if <br />
Jeremy could make sure no one hurt Spike.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one hurt Spike. I'm worried about him hurting us!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya should see him! No trace of antlers on him, no scars, and no trace of those muscles of <br />
his.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not what I mean.&quot; John explained, &quot;Ever see the movie Chucky? No? Good! I'm more <br />
scared on what's going on behind that cute face than whatever his build is right now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya think he's gonna murder us in our sleep?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Spike was, is, a lot of thing, but psychotic was never one of them. I'm just worried <br />
what he MIGHT do to get revenge on us!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Boss-Man Jeremy said for nobody to touch Spike so that settles that. And you <br />
haven't seen him. Spike was a ace at political science, but he stank at drama class. No way <br />
it's an act. He's like a typical kid with no one else his age to play with.&quot; <br />
<br />
John narrowed his eyes, &quot;If you suggest -us- going into the gene splicer to get turned into <br />
single digit aged fawns I swear I'm gonna..&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nonono! I just mean I don't think Spike is really something we have to worry about. I vote <br />
we worry about how Lance will be once we leave the park, and Bossman Jeremy is still IN <br />
the park with Boss lady Leticia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least we'll have plenty to keep him from torturing the pledges with all the blackmail <br />
material we're collecting with how he's acting towards Jeremy now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Robbie nodded. &quot;Thank Heaven for that.&quot;</p>
