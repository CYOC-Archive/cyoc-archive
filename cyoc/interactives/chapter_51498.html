<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daisy stood and then started to pace back and forth. After a moment she announced, &quot;I think what we need is first a place that we can call home for the time being, clothes and a something to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked at the rest of the girls, saw that they too were confused about waking up as a four to five year old girl, and then turning back to Daisy, Dan nodded and then agreed by explaining, &quot;Clothes and food would be a good idea...seeing as we no longer have fur coats, feathers or thick hides to protect us...nor are we dependent on humans or have the ability to hunt for out food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisy nodded and then announced, &quot;I need everyone here to explain what animal they were, what name they were addressed by if applicable and what name they wish to be addressed by from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
A girl with sandy blonde stepped forward and replied, &quot;Before I was a hen. I was never addressed by any name, but I think I would like to be called Henrietta from now...seeing as it is as close to Hen as I can get.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl standing next to Henrietta, who had red hair, explained, &quot;I was a fox and also had no name…So I would like to be called Vicky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked at Princess and then addressing the group, explained, &quot;I was a sow and before that I think I might have been a dog...It's kind of fuzzy and hard to recall suddenly. I would still like to be called Dan, or Daniela as a formal name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess looked at the group and then said in a quiet tone, &quot;I was a cat. I was called Princess by the girl that claimed ownership for me. I would like to be called Abby from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daisy nodded at this and replied, &quot;I was a dog before....the dog that led you here. I hope you will not find too much fault with me for the situation we suddenly find ourselves in. I do not want to be called Daisy or Duke. From now on I shall be known as Heather.&quot;<br />
<br />
Murmurs of agreement and Heather started to try and get the others attention. When she finally had it, with the help of Dan, she explained, &quot;Right now we need to find clothes and a place to live. As a dog I stayed at an abandoned house some ways from here. I also remember that there were several neighbouring house close, but not to close. We might be able to find what we need there.&quot; More acknowledgements and then Henrietta and Abby elected Heather to lead the way.<br />
<br />
Moving through the forest, the group of girls remained silent as they followed Heather. Deeper into the forest they trekked until the woods suddenly broke and they found themselves in an overgrown field. Off to one side they all could see a run-down farm house.<br />
<br />
As the five girls approached the building, Heather announced, &quot;Go inside and try to make yourselves as comfortable as possible. I will see what I can find to assist us in our living conditions. By the way, in case you're worried about any of the people that cursed us discovering our location, don't worry. The spell that turned us like this also hinds us from those who would do us harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning to Dan, she asked, &quot;Can I have a word with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused, Dan watched the others make their way toward the building, noted that there was also what appeared to be a dilapidated barn stuck back in the trees, and then turning back to Heather, she nodded.<br />
<br />
Heather didn't say anything, and instead started walking away. After a moment she explained, &quot;There may be a way to age ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stopping, Dan sputtered out, &quot;But how? I thought you said we were unable to do any forms of magick in our current forms? That we were stuck like this until we grew up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather continued walking and when Dan finally caught up, she explained, &quot;We are unable to do certain types of magick in these childe forms. However, there is an alternate option. We could mix up a potion that would force our bodies to age. But, the catch being is that could age ourselves to far...possibly cheating ourselves out of life and revenge against those cursed us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan was thoughtful and then after a bit she asked, &quot;So why are you telling me this? Why aren't you telling the rest of the group?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather immediately replied, &quot;Because. I sense in you the most magickal power. It's because of this, that I you to be the one to make this decision on what we should do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan was taken aback by this bit of knowledge and then asked, &quot;Can I discuss it over with the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather nodded and then said, &quot;If you want. That is your decision. But I ask that you wait until I found out all the pros and cons to the potion. I already know it is going to take several ingredients, plus several months to brew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan stopped and this time so did Heather. After a bit, Dan replied, &quot;Find out all you can about this potion. I think the best thing to do is make a move once we have all the information.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked at Dan and then after a moment, replied, &quot;Not only possibly powerful in magick, but also maybe wise beyond your years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked down, feeling herself blush. As she looked down, Heather commented, &quot;Go back to the house. I am going to find us some food and clothes. I won’t be gone long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking up, Dan watched Heather turn and began walking into the woods at the edge of the field. Turning around, Dan looked across the field and at the dilapidated house, questions buzzing about her head. After a moment, feeling like it was a good idea, she took off at a run across the field, giving a couple hops and skips every once and awhile.</p>
