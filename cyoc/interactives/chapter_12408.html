<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erick searched the east wing of the mansion.  It was eerie, filled with many victorian style gadgets and clocks.  It was pretty creepy, at least at night.  He opened a few doors, many of which led to empty rooms, but he found a large steel door.  He grabbed on and pulled, the slightly rusty door not moving very easily.  Erick blamed it on his strength.  At 18, he was a skinny 6 feet tall, weighing 150.  He stared at the door with his steely blue eyes, running his hand through his reddish brown hair.  He huffed, and noticed the door sliding slowly open.  He smiled to himself &quot;heh, stupid door.  I knew I'd get it open.&quot;.  He walked in to find an old gym, filled with weights and machines.  &quot;Cool...&quot; he said as he rubbed his hands over the seemingly fresh equipment.  He heard a mettalic clanking around the corner, and peered around to see a man lifting weights.  It was... Ryan?  Hadn't he gone the other way?<br />
<br />
  Ryan turned &quot;Hey Erick.  Great gym, huh?&quot;.  Erick looked around a bit more &quot;Yeah.  It's kind of out of date, but I guess it's still pretty impressive.&quot;.  Ryan put down the weights &quot;I've got an idea!  Since we're here till the storm stops, why not work on your muscles?&quot;. Erick sighed &quot;Sure, but it won't do any good.  I never gain an ounce of muscle.&quot;.  Ryan chuckled somewhat sinisterly &quot;Oh, we can fix that...&quot;.  With a turn, 'Ryan' faded away from sight.  Just as Erick was about to run, two large muscular arms pinned him from behind.  &quot;What's going on!?&quot; Erick cried.  A voice boomed &quot;Just a little steroid treatment to bulk you up.&quot;  An invisible force started ripping Erick's shirt down the front then tore it right off.  Now, the button on his cargo shorts taken completely off, his fly unzipped and the shorts were pulled right from his body along with his boxers.  He stood there in only his sandals, naked to the world.  The booming voice piped up again. <br />
<br />
  &quot;Well, let's see.  6 feet tall, 150 pounds, pretty close to hairless... a good quality for a bodybuilder.  Hmm... you have an 8 inch penis as well?  All you guys seem to have that going for you.  I must warn you, the steroid causes extreme shrinkage of the genitals.&quot;. Erick was panicing, moreso as he saw a small syring filled with blue liquid floating towards him.  It passed behind him and shoved into his right buttock, making him wince.  The cool fluid passed into his veins.  Then the two arms pinning him dissappeared.  He felt his body, still in one peice, beginning to tingle.  His cock and balls felt really warm.  He looked down at them, seeing them shrinking.  &quot;Oh god!&quot; he shouted, dropping his hands to his shrinking manhood. 6 inches, 5 inches, 4 inches.  His balls shrinking and shrinking beneath his cock, now the size of marbles.  His dick shrinking, becoming thinner and shorter, 3 inches, 2 inches, 1 inch, the head pulled into his groin, only it's tip visible, and he realized it had gotten hard.  His balls shrunken to the size of peas below the nib.<br />
<br />
  Then, his entire body started to feel warm.  His muscles ached a moment, but then began to swell.  His stick-thin arms started to thicken up, his biceps growing rounder, his forearms more vascular.  His delts becoming defined.  The growth spread into his pecs, making the flat expanse of his chest into two small hills.  His thighs started to swell closer to one another, and his ass became increasingly bubble-like.  His quads were striated, his calves bulging, his upper body spreading as he grew to 200 pounds.  The growth accellerated, his lats bulging underneath swelling triceps.  His lats grew on each side of his thickening neck.  A huge crease appeared down his pecs, and his abs tightened and ripped across his abdomen.  His body a swollen 250 pounds.  He grunted, his voice much lower than before.  &quot;gahuh!&quot;  He winces as his chest heaved out again, his skin tight across it.  &quot;Stop it, please?!&quot; he cried.  He noticed he was starting to get a little shorter...  His increasing muscles bulking up on a now 5'9&quot; body.<br />
<br />
  His thighs pushed each other appart, his stance widening.  He was an impossibly big 314 pounds, much heavier than Ryan, their most &quot;in shape&quot; friend.  He groaned as he tried to move to the door.  His beefy quads moved around each other sluggishly, creating friction with each step.  He grew as he walked, his now 400 pound body restricting his movement.  His skin made stressed noises, his muscles whined as they passed around each other.  Skin rubbing up on skin.  Normally he would be able to feel his balls swaying, but they didn't move.  Maybe it was good that they were so small and high up, he thought, now his swollen quads can't crush them.  His trap muscles were rubbing the base of his seriously squared jaw now.  Even his facial muscles had bulked a bit.  He had a heavier brow and a broader jaw.  He finally reached the door. <br />
<br />
  His huge arms were pulled from the resting place of his lats, revealing the 6 foot silhouette of his upper body.  He grabbed the latch, which was higher now that he was 5'7&quot;, and pulled.  The door came off easily, however, he couldn't fit through the frame.  Even turning sideways didn't help.  His balance went off as his back grew, and Erick fell back onto the floor.  He couldn't move!  His muscles had become so large that they couldn't move around one another.  He grew pound after solid pound to 700.  His body had swollen to hulk like proportion.  His veins popping across his body, his neck thicker than his head, and shoulders broader than the front of a big rig.  He was a freak.<br />
<br />
  The voice boomed once more.  &quot;Well, that was today's workout.  Your new stats are 5'6&quot;... should have told you that the steroid affects height, huh?  Oh, 707 pounds, a good start... the shrinkage unfortunately did take effect, so you're 1 16th of an inch down there. We'll do another workout depending on how well your other friends fare out.&quot;</p>
