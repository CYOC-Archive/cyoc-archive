<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pulling her car up to the driveway, massaging her aching head, Martha Mae took a moment to try and recollect her nerves before she went inside. She&#39;d accepted by now that she had four arms, and actually came to rather like the extra pair of hands. She decided she rather liked having such impressive breasts, even though they hurt her back. Nothing a little exercise can&#39;t help, if she&#39;s lucky. She&#39;d even come to grips with adding Mae to the end of her first name, and the fact she was referring to herself by the surname McFuck, despite how idiotically perverted it sounded.<br />
<br />
What she didn&#39;t like was the half erect horse cock and balls dangling out of the open crotch in her pants. Damn thing was getting in the way, and it stunk like hell. It throbbed and ached, and all the while it made her head swim. The only thing more unbelievable than this was that it was real, and she could feel it. She felt like a god damned monster. She took the trucker hat off of her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is awl yer fault, yew know that?&quot; she said to it. The hat, being a hat, didn&#39;t respond. Martha Mae hug it off of her rear view mirror with a dejected sigh and got out of her car. By this point she didn&#39;t care whether or not anyone saw her like this, some half-naked, white-trash, four-armed, horse-peckered freak. Her head was pounding and her body was exhausted. I mean, why else would she be so sweaty? She smelled really musky too, so it&#39;d probably behoove her to take a hot shower. She got inside, and locked the door behind her.<br />
<br />
First thing she did after she got home was walk into the kitchen and grab a beer from the fridge. These were her roommate&#39;s beers, and she knew it, but for some reason she felt like she needed a stiff one. She was surprised to find that it actually tasted pretty good. She used to hate the taste of beer, but it seemed her new body thought otherwise. Definitely strange, but she figured it made a bit of sense. After all, she supposed she was a bit of a hick now.<br />
<br />
Martha Mae dug her wallet out of her pocket, wondering whether its contents were any different. She suddenly realized that she&#39;d pulled her wallet from her pocket rather than her purse. She remembered leaving the house with her purse... or did she? Her head was still aching. Taking another swig from her beer, she opened her wallet to look at her driver&#39;s licence. She noticed that the picture had changed to reflect her new farmer&#39;s tan and four arms, but she was wearing a top that fit her new rack... namely just a cropped tank top that was pretty much just a bra given its stretched out neck. She also noticed that it now had her new name printed on it, and a letter H under sex.<br />
<br />
NAME: Martha Mae Doolittle-McFuck<br />
DoB: 9/15/19XX     SEX: H     HAIR: BLO     EYE: BLU<br />
<br />
She definitely remembered that her licence didn&#39;t used to say that. She remembered it used to say her sex was Female, not whatever &quot;H&quot; was supposed to mean. Plus, it looked like there was no getting around it. Somehow, someway her legal name was now &quot;McFuck.&quot; Martha Mae McFuck. She hated to admit it, but it had a nice ring to it. She supposed Doolittle was little more than a maiden name now, but it was strange. Thinking about it, she felt lonely. Probably because she was the only one in the world named McFuck as far as she knew.<br />
<br />
She sucked up the last of her beer and hucked the can into the recycling. Somehow, the beer was clearing up her headache, which was a relief but also a bit worrying. She supposed she&#39;d better go take that shower now, see if she couldn&#39;t take care of this god forsaken musk she was making.<br />
<br />
She went to the bathroom, stripped down, and got into the shower. She turned it on as high as she could, reveling in the feeling of hot water on her sweaty body. She took this time to scrub and detangle her hair, using more shampoo than before because she had more hair on her head. While two of her arms were busy with her hair, her other arms were busy tackling her armpits. She soaped up all over her body, especially her breasts and between her butt crack. Those parts were two of her sweatiest places on her body, and the some of the most sensitive. Scrubbing those spots stimulated enough to bring her monster horse cock to full mast. This... this musky thing she dreaded scrubbing the most. With a twinge of revulsion she realized that the tip was starting to leak pre-cum. She saved scrubbing this member for last.<br />
<br />
When Martha Mae finally did get to scrubbing her horse cock, it was like an electric shock blasted up her spine. Her mind was taken over with pleasure and any trepidation she felt before was long since destroyed as she scrubbed and stroked her gigantic dick. Two of her hands worked the base of the shaft, while the other two started massaging it with her huge, sloshy breasts. She was so lost in the throes of ecstasy that she didn&#39;t realize that all of this stimulation was making her tits start to squirt milk. She scrubbed and stroked and massaged her cock as hot water washed over her body, a body that was producing its own heat as she brought herself to...<br />
<br />
She sprayed roiling hot horse cum all over her face and tits. She felt like she was jizzing more than the average human should be able to. She sat down in the shower, panting like a dog in the afterglow of orgasm. Her pecker had finally gone limp, now that her sexual frustration was taken care of. Plus, it felt like her headache had completely cleared up. She felt amazing... her new body felt really amazing... As she sat there in the shower, recovering from her amazing wank, a few thoughts came to mind. Maybe that hat had blessed her. Experiencing pleasure like this... she wished that other people could share in her pleasure. Maybe she could share her pleasure. But how? A new desire manifested within Martha Mae, and it brought a maniacal grin to her lips.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t want to be the only McFuck in the world. She wanted to make a clan.</p>
