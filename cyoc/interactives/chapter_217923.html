<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hank was enjoying this time his being an equine, it offering him his wants for male satisfaction. He had found a willing mare, as she felt a need for how he could relax her primal urge to procreate. She held no sense of love for Hank, and certainly would show him any loyalty if there were another stallion with her and available. Hank having spent three months of his life being a donkey Jack at stud, he might have felt  the same way; but he didn’t; he liking his being a Fjord breed pony, felt an attachment, both physical and mental toward the mare named Cindy.<br />
<br />
If Hank while being a pony animal held the full range of visual color perception, he might have appreciated Cindy more due to her sleek, dark brown body fur. Instead, and from what intrigued Hank the more about his choice mare came from his stallion intuition of how her vulva fit, accepting the sized girth and length of his cock into her hot depths. He held a human sense of love-passion for Cindy, something she could not return to realize that concept.<br />
<br />
However Rene, she Cindy’s owner, as having stood near and watched as Hank each time the two ponies mated, he showed Cindy a pattern of sensual grace to where Rene began to wonder as to the Fjord pony she named as Henry.<br />
Hank then became known by the name of Henry as according to Rene; but Hank wondered if the Tome was directing Rene in much the same affectionate manners like Cindy, continued to beckon Hank for more breeding sessions. As after each time that Hank bred Cindy, Rene would dutifully give her pet pony mare Cindy a garden hosing bath and grooming.<br />
<br />
Hank being as Henry to Rene, he too received a proper bathing; he having perspired from his stallion exertion while mating. Then in addition, did Rene know what a breeding stall had special attention required after mating a mare. <br />
<br />
She knelt beside her pony Henry and using warm water with soap and a sponge, she cleaned from his belly, sheath and penis the mixed bodily fluids spent by Cindy out of her vagina, and the semen that extra what coated his cock.<br />
The warm water helped to relax the stallion sheath, as would Hank relax feeling of tender, petite hanks both scrubbing and messaging his more-tender male organ. As after Rene had washed and patting his cock both cleaned and dried, she told by her father to then oiling the masculinity while it hung bloated but semi-erect. Rene did as directed, but when she did the first oiling of the tender skin, she felt embarrassed.<br />
<br />
However, time heals all wounds, so it tended to reduce the sense of feeling sickly humiliated from washing and caring for a stallion’s cock, sheath, and scrotum. It so happened that Rene began to feel aroused when washing the stallion cock; she adoring it most when oiling the skin, feeling the pony attain a fully erect arousal. Her feminine imagination began contemplating an idea of how such a cock might fit into her sensual depths; an inkling she knew as both bestial and immorally wrong.<br />
<br />
Rene began talking aloud while she serviced her stallion after he bred again with Cindy. Her thoughts wandered, as Hank stood aroused being Henry the stallion pony, began his lusty desire to try as mate as if he was a man.<br />
<br />
Mutual appreciations met with imagined ideas of how such an immoral meeting, joining might actually happen. <br />
<br />
Rene turned to the Internet, she reading from fantasy story archives the possible workings of how to address and survive the physical meeting/joining of two lusty, as different species mating. Rene, infatuated by her passion for her Henry and his cock, to how he bred with Cindy, that a human female began having nightly dreams.<br />
<br />
Hank as well did occasionally dream, but his desired lust tended to include the pony mare Cindy; but included Rene as if he wished she were as well a mare, where morality did not concern their possible joining. Hank held a connection with the Tome he thought as burned. His angered Devil-Familiar used its bond and guardianship for the Tome to discover where his impetuous wizard had run off and found a comfortable place to stay.<br />
<br />
Unbeknown by Hank, the Tome spirit, its guardian devil, joined to add spice into what Hank thought, enjoyed, and felt attracted by; this then included Rene, mare Cindy, and several other equine, sensual companions to whom Rene leased Hank to breed. <br />
<br />
“Good Morning Hank,” spoke a baritone voice there inside the small barn where Cindy and Hank slept separately in two stalls.<br />
<br />
Hank awoke with a jerk-start remembered horror from having heard the Devil-Familiar speaking. As Hank rose to standing, mare Cindy did the same.<br />
<br />
“Do speak my Master, we need to talk,” said the Familiar to his host.<br />
<br />
“Neighie…,” Hank whinnied, as then coughed, feeling an odd sensation in his throat. “Ah…, ah-huh, yes, okay, I can talk, thank you, my being limited of communication is or was a bother.<br />
<br />
So, you found me, and now I must pay for my burning of the Tome,” Hank said, while laying back his ears and ogling at the black figure, it of both man and pony as one being.<br />
<br />
“I brought with me the Tome, as it owns a self preserving guardian, me, and as well I am your guardian. I trust you are enjoying this romp thrill fandango of living as do pony stallion animals. Your mare, Cindy when born, she gifted with a cunt the same depth and grip similar to that of her mare-mother.<br />
<br />
Fourteen months as of this week since we parted company and you sought haven being a fun animal and pet. Your equine body has grown leaving you as a sleek, healthy, and virile stallion. Do your pony size testicles offer what you as a wizard and pony stallion fully appreciates; or should I enhance your semen volume, maybe the density of your’ ejaculate, and better the feelings during insemination?<br />
<br />
As from past adventures gifted to usually young wizards, by being young comes a want for delights of unholy or humanly immoral thrills. Humans think that animals own a more sensual lifestyle; and request being as horses mostly, but many tried being cows, bulls, pigs, sheep, goats, satyrs, and a varied form, along with different gender. <br />
<br />
Human tend to make me smile, they humor me, asking to become as if enslaved, owned, and used for their sexuality.<br />
My last young wizard used the Tome to spellbind his masculinity, beginning with changing his genitals to become those of a male goat. He continued to request further goat enhancing to his pelvis, legs, his heels to becoming as strong hocks, his feet rearranged, and adding fetlock joints with cloven hoofs. He asked for more until being as a Satyr, he laid a curse upon his scrotum, creating totalitarian infectious semen.<br />
<br />
Satyrs masturbate several times each day, and they enjoy sucking their cock, ingesting their semen; but totalitarian semen, can infect a satyr with distinctly goatish enhancements. The more a satyr suckles his cock, and from ingesting his infectious semen, the further they change to becoming as all a goat animal. <br />
<br />
Young Alfred, he just turned nineteen years his age, did begin requesting, changing, suckling, became as all a Billy goat animal physically by the date he was twenty years of age. Mentally, Alfred retained his realization of self, and the whole of his attained education. How he did lament, bleating when still capable to speak intelligibly. His wizard father disowned his son, selling him to a goat farm for use as a herd sire. Alfred has learned to delight at pissing on his beard, top of his head, neck, to aid with alluring of doe goats to him being randy for sex.<br />
<br />
Now as for you Master; and to dealing with your dreamed aspirations for the wanting of Miss Rene, she to become capable of her mating uninjured by you. Your cock length and girth I could change, or offer Rene her lusty desire by becoming your newest mare pony; a thought, she has considered if possible?<br />
<br />
Her transformation would require a curse, and by becoming a mare, if or when she lost her virginity, her lust merged into a permanent nuisance, would keep her properly a pony mare for her lifetime.<br />
<br />
If you choose to have her follow you being a mare, her lifetime could be as increased to similar that of yours. The Tome delights its owners by increasing the biblical life expectancy from three-score and ten years (70), as times ten to seven hundred years; and that becomes for you as a bunch of mare and cock mating sessions. Do consider your preference for Rene, whether she follows you, or I temporarily slim and shorten your cock to fit her and your thrilled delights.”</p>
