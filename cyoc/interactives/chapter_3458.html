<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin entered spent quite a bit of time on the computer entering in new information in Ben's profile.  Ben, delighted that his &quot;big&quot; brother was spending time with him, played quietly nearby, occasionally asking Justin questions.  Justin, absorbed in his work, simply grunted quick answers.
<br />

<br />
Finally, Justin looked at the entry.  He would put Ben back alright -- but back a little bit better than he had been before.  After all, even though he was kinda bossy sometimes, Ben was a super older bro -- and he deserved it!
<br />

<br />
Justin's knew his older brother was gay -- and that was no problem between them.  In fact, Justin felt sorry for his brother since Ben rarely went out on dates -- and only very rarely &quot;got any&quot;.  Ben was a cool guy and good looking.  His gym-going was a bit sporadic, though, and while athletic, Ben had never really developed his body.  He lacked the &quot;tanned and toned&quot; qualities that guys in the gay world lusted after.  Well, not after tonight!  Not only would Justin ramp up Ben's physique, he'd added a few bonus changes that he felt Ben needed -- and the program allowed him to make Ben think that all this was perfectly normal!
<br />

<br />
Justin turned to &quot;little&quot; Ben and said: &quot;Hey bro, why don't you and I go into your room and play?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;OK!&quot; Ben replied, happy that Justin was done working on the stupid computer.
<br />

<br />
As Ben scampered off to the other room, Justin rose to follow, he pulled down the FILE menu and clicked 'Save' as he got up.  He had adjusted the program for a fast transformation.  This should be fun to watch.
<br />

<br />
Justin darted into the bedroom just in time to see little Ben reel as the wave of sensation overtook him.  As Ben tried to clear his head, the changes began.  His height began to increase, pushing him upward inch by inch.  At the same time his body began to broaden, his torso and hips staying roughly the same boyish proportions then diverging, his waist staying relatively small while his shoulders continued to widen leaving him with a dramatic v-taper.  His stature was that of a prime male specimen, but Ben still retained his &quot;baby fat&quot; and boyish face.
<br />

<br />
It was all Justin could do to take in all the changes.  Everything was happening so fast!  Before his body had stopped growing, Ben's face and body had begun maturing quickly, moving through puberty at lightening speed.  Ben's jawline defined and became angular.  His cheekbones developed as his face took on a masculine, chiseled look.  At the same time, Ben's bod sprouted muscles.  Broad, square pecs popped out of his chest while ridges of abdominal muscle were cleaved from his midsection.  Ben's legs had grown thick, heavy muscles on their long bones and these, in contrast to his narrow waist, completed the athletic frame that Justin had wanted.
<br />

<br />
Thick, dark body hair had begun to sprout all over Ben's developing body.  His pubes pushed out first -- a super-thick bush of hair that was significantly larger and more noticeable than it had been before.  Out of this, a dark, silky treasure trail shot up the thick abs to his pecs fanned out into short, flat swirls that set off the athletic pecs perfectly.  The same dark hair had quickly crept up Ben's thick legs and arms, and a dark patch had even grown in his deep pits.
<br />

<br />
The hair growth on Ben's legs continued up in back to cover what was fast becoming a pretty big bubble butt.  Justin grinned as he remembered Ben commenting that he always had wanted a butt that would catch guys' eyes.  Well, he was going to get a bod that guys would be following down the street and flinging themselves at!
<br />

<br />
The development was continuing in front as well – Ben’s package was growing bigger by the second.  Justin realized that he may have overdone it a bit here, but he knew gay guys liked cock – so why shouldn’t Ben have some big equipment to match his big bod?  He watched his brothers cock and balls swell up huge.  The cock would easily pop the tape at 10 thick inches, and the balls looked like two billiard balls in their low-hanging sac. 
<br />

<br />
Preoccupied with the growth of Ben’s genitals, Justin soon realized that his brother was getting more and more muscular as well.  The smooth athletic physique was quickly giving way to a more muscular one.  Ben’s arms and pecs bulged and thickened while his abs tightened into rounded bricks.  His legs swelled and widened and finally his back exploded with huge lats that gave his v-taper an even more exaggerated appearance.  While Ben had gotten big, he was still athletic – and not huge.  Justin hadn't overdone Ben’s muscles for the simple reason that he had wanted to stay much more muscular than Ben.  There wasn't much rivalry between the two, but Justin wanted to try out being the &quot;big&quot; little bro for a change.
<br />

<br />
Ben's body had buffed out though.  In fact, he had begun to resemble a fitness model.  His entire body looked athletic and natural, but the thick arms, pecs and thighs, the tiny waist and rippled abs all combined to make Ben one hunky stud!
<br />

<br />
Soon, the program had run its course.  Justin watched Ben closely as he shook his head and gained his balance.  Justin had programmed Ben to completely forget that he had been a kid this afternoon.  Moreover, Justin had re-programmed Ben completely to make him think he’d always been a big, handsome athletic hunk.  Justin had even programmed Ben to forget about the online program that had made the changes possible.  He wanted to keep that to himself for a while.
<br />

<br />
Finally, Ben’s new sexy, deep voice said &quot;Whoa, man.  I feel weird.  Hey Just…did we come in here to…play?  What were we doing?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Play?  Uh, yeah – you’re, uh…going to &quot;play&quot; around at the gym. You came in here to get your to go workout, remember?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ohhh.  Yeah.  Now I remember.  Of course!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Justin sighed a breath of relief, as he realized his reprogramming had worked.  He watched as Ben pulled together an assortment of gym clothes and put them in a bag.  The program had even changed all of Ben’s clothes to fit his new augmented physique!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Quick thinking!&quot; thought Justin.  &quot;Now I’ll have a couple of hours to work on that program some more!&quot;</p>
