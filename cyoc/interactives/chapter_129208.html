<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan was in a daze for the rest of the night. At some point he dressed himself before the pizza arrived, then he and his uncle sat down to watched a football game on television and drank a few beers. When his uncle left, he warned Aiden to stay out of trouble and made him promise again not to fall for any more penis enlargement scams. It wasn&#39;t until the door closed behind his uncle that the full weight of the situation hit him. He had a pathetic little microdick. He would be stuck with a pathetic microdick forever...<br />
<br />
&quot;no...NO...NO-NO-NO-NO-NO!&quot; Aidan started freaking out. He ran over to his laptop and opened it, wincing as he sat on his bruised bum. The desktop short-cut was missing, the start menu launcher was gone, even the installation folder had been removed! He ran over to the trash and fished out the disk that had been snapped in half and desperately tried to shove both halves into the disk tray. The computer just ejected the tray again over and over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; Aidan denied, desperately trying to push the CD back in &quot;THIS CAN&#39;T BE HAPPENING.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then a thought hit him. If reality shifted around him so his uncle knew he always had a tiny dick then who else knew? He logged onto his social media accounts and saw that he had significantly less contacts than he remembered. Browsing through he realised that he had not made as many friends in high school or college. In fact none of his casual college hook ups were contacts. He jumped onto his phone to look through his dating app. His profile was completely different. For one it labelled him as a bottom. Secondly he only had clothed muscle poses in his profile pictures. Most of his previous conversations consisted of him sharing dick pics that weren&#39;t his but pretending they were to receive some in exchange. Not only that he never actually met up with anyone, when he did make plans he kept cancelling on them or being extremely vague to string guys along. The tiny dick version of himself was a flaky cat-fishing virgin LOSER!<br />
<br />
Aidan tried figuring out what to do next. This sort of thing must happen all the time right? Maybe an email to Transdem would easily rectify the situation. He quickly looked up their contact information and logged onto his email account. Of course the inbox was absolutely flooded with penis enlargement spam. After cursing his alternate self he started composing a new email detailing his problem and sent it off. As he eagerly bounced up and down waiting for a response he realised he had to pee.<br />
<br />
In front of the toilet bowl, he resigned himself to the fact his penis would not extend past his pants and underwear and pulled them down to his ankles. Refusing to give in and sit down, he pushed back the pubic fat on either side of his penis and began to pee. Instantly a pinhole leak urine stream flew way off target and splashed against the back of the toilet. Readjusted by the slightest angle caused his streaming to go veering widely and holding his penis only succeeded in getting piss on his fingers. He paused his pathetic piddle stream, sighed and got the tweezers, once again pinching his penis between the two prongs. The tiny trickle became much easier to aim and manipulate. However Aidan&#39;s bladder had not changed size and it took over ten times as long for his wee willy to fully expel all his wee wee. After three or four minutes Aidan used the tweezers to milk out the last few droplets before pulling up his pants which now had a few specks of piss on them. He hated to imagine the mess he would have made had Uncle Bill not made him shave.<br />
<br />
Back at the laptop he saw he had six new emails; five more ads for various penis enlargement products and one from Transdem Labs!<br />
<br />
&quot;We regret to inform you changes that have been made &quot;Permanent until changed by subject&quot; can not be reversed unless your ID (registered at the time of initial scanning) and CD+CD-KEY installation match. We can not send any replacement CD&#39;s or CD-keys for security reasons.<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Transdem Labs&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan screeched and felt the urge to throw his laptop out the window. It&#39;s not fair! It&#39;s just not fair! He took a moment to think of what other options he had. Maybe this was all related to the way companies always preferred to use proprietary technology to turn a larger profit. If he looked online, surely there would be a way to &quot;jail break&quot; the transformation and reverse it. He decided to log onto the transformation website that sent him the damn Chronivac in the first place and made a post on the forums outlining his situation and asking if there were any available third party hacks (He didn&#39;t provide any specifics measurements, even with the anonymity it was extremely embarrassing).<br />
<br />
As Aidan sat back and waited for a response he started feeling a stirring in his little thimble. Deciding to masturbate to kill time while he waited he went to check his favourite submissions on the site. To his dismay they were all different. Where once he had compiled a wide reaching list of animal, human, and inanimate transformation, was now replaced entirely by penis shrinking and growing content. This guy was obsessed. In fact Microdick Aidan had even written a few stories himself. Strangely the original Aidan never thought of himself as the creative writing type and had always stuck to submitting art. Curiously he decided to read through some of it. There were dozens of chapters about penis growth wish fulfilment but spattered around was some of the most depraved and self loathing small penis humiliation stories he had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Despite the bizarreness of the situation Aidan&#39;s pathetic pin-dick became aroused and began dripping precum. Aidan pulled down his pants and tried to grip his bald little shrimp dick but found he was unable to get a proper hold. Earlier there had been residual fluid filling his genitals which made ejaculation much easier but now that he had equalised the task of achieving orgasm became a lot more difficult. Try as he did to tug his teeny toothpick the thing kept slipping out of his fingers. He spotted pair of rubber padded tweezers on the side of the desk and snatched them up gripping his wee willy gently between them. After slowly tugging his dicklet became hard as a thumb-tack and he was once again experiencing the most intensely pleasurable masturbation session if his life as he read through the alternate Aidan&#39;s perverted fantasies. It wasn&#39;t long before he was vigorously pulling his miniature manhood with quicker short strokes. His tweezers slipped a few times but after making a tighter grip he was able to wank his wee wee at top speed. The tweezers started to become a blur as his puny pecker came close to cumming. The intensity increased until he pulled himself over the edge and released an orgasmic squeal, once again he felt as himself go through waves of pleasure, expecting large globs of ejaculate to spray the screen but watched as his little pimple produce no more than one tiny bead of cum oozing out lazily.<br />
<br />
Aidan caught his breath and wiped the cum off with his finger and tasted it and felt another pang of regret when realising shooting  a fountain of cum directly into his own mouth was no longer possible. When wiping himself off he once again noted how much easier it was to clean his freshly shaved privates. Exhaustion was slowly overtaking him, but he decided to check on his forum post before bed. There was one reply and it was from a mod.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;ve made a &quot;Permanent until changed by subject&quot; transformation it&#39;s impossible to undo this without the original CD and CD-key. This is a security measure to stop &quot;clone spoofing&quot; where people will use third party technologies to clone subjects and use them to bypass the recognition system and remove other people&#39;s permanent transformations.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ll just have to learn to live with your transformation. I&#39;ve provided some links to several transformation support groups and counselling services below to help. I also recommend you look up a small penis support group in your area. This thread will be locked as discussions on device hacking are not allowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan world came crashing down as his last shred of hope was torn away. He would give anything to have his old penis back. As he went to close the browser and cry himself to sleep, he noticed he had a private message. It was from a user called Craig23013426.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sTarnsformer1989, if you are trying to increase your penis size I recommend paying MaleAlteration.com a visit, check out the penis modification section!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan was confused and typed out a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the mod said that transformation reversal was impossible?&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before he got a reply<br />
<br />
&quot;MaleAlteration.com provide many different transformation products but they specialize primarily on penis size and function.<br />
<br />
Did you know that this site has a sponsorship with Transdem? If you&#39;ve been told Transdem is the only reliable product or If you&#39;ve been told a transformation from one of their products is permanent you have been misinformed. This site is contractually obliged to give their standard Transdem policy response when asked about other options. There are many third party products that are more affordable and stronger, but Transdem don&#39;t want you to know about them because they want people only buying their overpriced licensed products and they don&#39;t want word to get out that their tech isn&#39;t the most effective on the market.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew it!&quot; Aidan yelled, Transdem were just a bunch of heartless corporate bastards. He continued reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to increase your penis size try the Manhood Maximizer Pills from MaleAlteration.com. Each pill contains special nanotechnology that is based on the same technology Transdem uses. I&#39;ve tried them myself and I am very happy with the results!&quot;<br />
<br />
What followed was a photo of a man with a modest three inch penis followed by a photo of the same man grinning broadly and sporting an eight inch erection. Aidan&#39;s face lit up as he tapped out a reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing Craig, you&#39;re a real life saver! I can&#39;t thank you enough!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan sent off the message and went to visit MaleAlteration.com and clicked a few tabs until he found the penis enlargement section with sub-sections for lotions, pills and other devices. Taking Craig&#39;s advice he chose the Manhood Maximizer Pills and saw a list of available products as well as a big disclaimer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Disclaimer: We recommend only using Manhood Maximizer products with a recommended size as close as possible BENEATH your current penis size! You can use any product with a recommended size beneath your current size, however the further you are away from recommended size the less effective our nanotechnology will be. Using a product rated above your current size will have no effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pills for people who were already twelve inches and up were only around £7 a bottle. However as Aidan scrolled down the prices started getting higher and higher. Anyone less than eight inch penis had to pay at least £21 a bottle. He gulped as the prices became steeper finally topping at approximately £40 a bottle for anyone more than zero but less than one inch. Knowing it would be well worth the investment in the end he clicked the link to see more about the product. It was a slower acting transformation but would morph his penis by two inches in just three weeks. Aidan read some of the reviews.<br />
<br />
&quot;Works amazing, I started at half an inch and saw results by the first week, by the time three weeks was up I was rocking a 3&quot; dick and moved onto the higher rated pills. It&#39;s been 3 months and I&#39;ve now got a 8 inch cock. Though I recommend getting some Potency Preserve to combat any problems with your body being unable to maintain a larger erection. You could always get some Super Stiff Tonic later but it&#39;s more expensive than just getting the Preservers&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone gave me a couple of spare bottles of this stuff as well as some Sensitivity Stabilizers as a gift and I gotta say the stuff really works! I already had a 3 inch penis so I didn&#39;t get the full effect but after going through 2 bottles in 6 weeks I&#39;m now pushing on average and my partner is very satisfied! The Sensitivity Stabilizers were also great for balancing out any problems with loss of feel&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve tried phony enlargement creams from other companies before and had completely given up on ever having a proper dick. But when I saw Manhood Maximizer Pills used the same tech as a certain other popular brand I had to give it a try and the results were astonishing. Forget the fake lotions guys, Manhood Maximizer Pills are the real deal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan was convinced and went to add the product to his cart, however his face fell when he saw a red notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Due to low demand, this product is only available in bulk packs of 6 bottles for £216.63<br />
Click here to see if there are any distributors stocking this product near you&quot;<br />
<br />
After inputting his postal code he found out no one had it in stock. He was a bit annoyed but figured he wouldn&#39;t want to stop at two inches anyway and if he bought bulk he&#39;d be able to push a little further probably up to six inches. He went to check his bank account but there was a nasty surprise waiting for him.<br />
<br />
His savings had dwindled significantly! Looking through his transaction history he saw many purchases from companies that were very obviously discreet cover names as well as the occasional blatantly labelled &quot;Male Enhancement Inc&quot; or &quot;BiggerDick4U.co.uk&quot;. Microdick Aidan was a real sucker, he had spent over £3000 on ineffective penis enlargement products! Aidan cursed that fucking dumb-ass; how could Microdick Aidan be so gullible as to blow all his savings on these scams, now the real Aidan wouldn&#39;t be able to afford any penis enlargement pills. He sighed and figured he would save up for a while so he could still pay his rent. He started closing tabs when he saw another message from Craig.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sTarnsformer1989, I just remembered something! I&#39;ve been a loyal customer to MaleAlteration.com for so long they emailed me a discount code last week, but I&#39;ve got all the products I need right now so I figured you could use it more than me, use the code &quot;enlarge23013426&quot; and you&#39;ll receive 10% off for orders of $600 USD or more! Unfortunately the code expires in an hour so you gotta act quickly! If you haven&#39;t reached the discount price I recommend potency preservers to ensure you get the same potency for your larger penis. They maintain your erectile strength for every 3 inches of growth. The Sensitivity Stabilizer cream isn&#39;t a bad option either since some people complain about reduced feeling, and they work for 5 inches a tub&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan praised his good fortune! It was settled, he couldn&#39;t pass up this opportunity even if it meant shorting his uncle on rent this month. Quickly reopening the tab he set the currency to USD, Aidan added the $300 bulk purchase of Manhood Maximizer Pills and two bottles of Potency Preservers for $100 and one bottle of Sensitivity Stabilizer Cream for $50 to his cart before realising he was $150 short of the discount. Then a thought struck him, the bulk pack would probably only get him to six inches. Why not push it further and get the penis he had wanted in the first place? He looked at the recommended six inch Manhood Maximizer Pills only realise the effectiveness reduced to one inch per bottle when going past 6+ recommended inches (He figured it was probably why they were cheaper). He added a six inch bottle and seven inch bottle for $30 each, then realising he&#39;d need extra Potency Preservers and Sensitivity Stabilizers grabbed two more $50 bottles filling his cart to $610. He converted back to pounds input the discount code and proceeded to the checkout.<br />
<br />
Aidan grabbed his wallet to get his card number, the compartment where he kept his cash was disappointingly bare, the sleeve where he kept his emergency condom had a spare set of tweezers. After getting out his bank card and entering his details he looked at the total price of his order plus tax and shipping and baulked; He took a deep breath and cursed his alternate self for wasting all his money on fake dick pills before  finalizing his payment.<br />
<br />
After he had nearly drained his bank account he went back to thank Craig for the discount code, but when he clicked reply on the message he was redirected to an error page.<br />
<br />
&quot;This user has been banned&quot;<br />
<br />
Aidan felt a pang of guilt. They must&#39;ve banned the poor guy for telling him about competing products. Bloody fascists. Aidan turned off his computer and went to bed. All night he tossed and turned, unable to get to sleep, excited as he was that in a few months time he would have the penis of his dreams.<br />
<br />
To make a long story short; no the pills didn&#39;t work; yes his uncle found out and punished him again; no that wasn&#39;t the last time Aidan fell for a penis enlargement scam.</p>
