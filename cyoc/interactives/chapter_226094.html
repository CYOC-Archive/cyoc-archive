<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taking a deep breath, Jeff sighed heavily. After three rounds of love making the teen was exhausted. Still, he wanted to see what this new reality was like. Walking to his little brothers room, he now peaked inside to take a look at his little brother.<br />
<br />
Amazingly the five children seemed to be getting along well. With Tony no longer present, the group seemed genuinely calmer. Both sets of twins seemed to embrace the other, the four preschoolers working as a team as they built a block castle. This surprised Jeff as the boys technically outnumbered the girls. Hopefully as the children grew their bond would remain strong. Still, Jeff could see some lingering problems with the reality he created.<br />
<br />
Mikey was quiet. While part of the group he almost seemed like a literal fifth wheel as the twins seemed to gravitate towards one another. In their little world the twins shared a bond that Mikey couldn&#39;t. It didn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t like Mikey, they just liked their twon more. &quot;Aw poor little guy,&quot; Stacey said softly. Jeff turned, casting the ebony haired nurse a curious look. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn&#39;t quite fit in,&quot; Stacey stated. &quot;He&#39;s not a twin like the others. You can tell just by looking at him that he feels left out.&quot; Jeff could only shrug his shoulders, he sort of understood what Stacey was saying. Still, there were only five kids and inevitably their was going to be one child who was the odd man out. &quot;I kinda wish he did have a twin sister,&quot; Stacey mused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Jeff asked. Stacey shrugged, the 25 year old simply thinking out loud. &quot;I&#39;m just saying it would be easier for the little guy,&quot; she said. &quot;He&#39;d probably relate better to his friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Jeff chuckled. &quot;I think one little sibling is enough.&quot; Stacey laughed, nudging Jeff playfully. &quot;Oh cmon Jeff you&#39;re a great big brother,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ve seen how you are with Mikey and his friends. Heck, I wish I had a big brother like you when I was growing up.&quot; Jeff paused, a feeling of dread washing over him. Was the Chronovac still taking voice commands to overwrite reality?<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa I feel weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeffs eyes went wide as he watched Stacey swoon. As the woman grabbed her head, Jeff realized that Stacey&#39;s musings were being taken as actual commands. Already he could tell that the 25 year old seemed a bit fresher than only a moment ago. &quot;Ph crap,&quot; he thought in alarm. Quickly taking Stacey&#39;s hand, he now rushed to his room with a very confused 22 year old.<br />
<br />
Locking the door to his room, Jeff turned, shocked by what he saw. Stacey didn&#39;t look a day over 21, her scrubs appearing loose on her youthening body. As she looked into Jeffs mirror, his anxiety only increased. Unlike the others she seemed to recognize what was going on. &quot;What&#39;s happening,&quot; she whispered, reaching her hand up to her youthful face. &quot;Oh my god Jeff! I&#39;m...I&#39;m..GETTING YOUNGER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was speechless, staring in awe as Stacey continued her backwards trip. Leaving college behind the now 18 year old watched as her hips shrank. The freshman fifteen melting off her body, leaving her with perky breasts and a thinner waist. Instinctively she now reached for her scrubs pants as they slipped on her waist. &quot;What&#39;s happening why am I getting younger?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I think you wished it,&quot; Jeff said, not entirely believing the words as they left his mouth. Stacey was too bewildered to speak, the now 15 year old gazing at her appearance. It didn&#39;t seem possible but it was her. The waifish ebony haired girl with a thin body and roundish face. She remembered being 15 and was none too happy about it. Stacey had been a bit of a wallflower, the cute quiet girl who was too shy amongst her peers. Gazing at her innocent face with large round eyes, she sniffed. &quot;Make it stop,&quot; she whined, her voice transitioning from woman to girl. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a little girl again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff hugged her, trying to comfort Stacey as best he could. It felt odd as the girl shrank in his embrace, growing shorter and thinner in his arms. Gazing into Stacey&#39;s wide, terrified, eyes he could see she was quickly losing height. The 13 year old looking to him for comfort as her  diminishing height forced her to crane her neck. &quot;We&#39;ll fix this somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stacey nodded, the girl going from teen to preteen. Realizing her clothes weren&#39;t adjusting to her size, the girl sat on Jeffs bed in a huff. &quot;Jeff I still feel weird,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I&#39;m like forgetting things. Like forgetting what it&#39;s like to be an adult.&quot; Jeff could only squeeze the girl in a vain attempt to comfort her. Until the program had run its course their was nothing he could do.<br />
<br />
Stacey continued to sulk, watching her feet as they slowly began to rise from the floor. The now 10 year old frowning as she gazed at her enormous medical scrubs and shoes. &quot;Dumb old shoes,&quot; she grumbled, kicking her sneakers off her diminutive feet, exposing her socks that were now several sizes too large. &quot;I&#39;ll find you something to wear Stacey I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kay,&quot; Stacey said sadly, the girl leaving double digits. Thr entire process was proving to be humiliating. Stacey had watched puberty reverse itself, her body growing smaller as the assets of puberty abandoned her. If Jeff hadn&#39;t been here to comfort her she thought she would lose her mind. As it was she felt a certain sad wonder at her predicament as her feet were gradually swallowed by her pant legs.<br />
<br />
Stacey&#39;s sadness though was gradually replaced with a momentary giggle fit. The now 7 year old finding her predicament funny. She felt like she was playing dress up, kicking her legs and watching the empty pant legs flap like a flag in the wind. At this point, she had forgotten her adult profession but knew she was supposed to be older. Just how old though she wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced down at the diminutive ebony haired girl at his side. Stacey looked ready for kindergarten now, the girls clothes seeming like a blanket. If she tried to stand, her scrubs would immediately collapse around her ankles. Thankfully she appeared small enough now that her top would cover her like a dress. If it would stay on though was another story entirely as one of thw girls shoulders poked through the neck hole.<br />
<br />
Stacey now left kindergarten behind, returning once more to a preschooler of four. Taking stock of the girl, Jeff noted her round face, thick black hair, and wide innocent eyes. Shyly the girl glanced up at Jeff, astounded at the size difference between them. Only moments ago, she could have sworn they were the same size. Niw she felt so small sitting next to the much large teenager. As the silence lingered between the pair, Jeff could only wonder how much of the adult Stacey was left.</p>
