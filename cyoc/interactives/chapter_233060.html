<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the family quartet looked over the map, so many different options were available to them and there was so much that they wanted to explore. Ellen was a lover of all things pertaining to merfolk, but Doug wasn&#39;t keen on them in the least. He knew it was a fantasy for her to be a mermaid ever since watching &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; as a young girl when it was first released in theaters ages ago... now here was her chance. Doug, like his kids, were far more into werebeasts and Werebeast Woods was the very place Doug wanted to explore above all of the other places. He was incredibly curious about what it would be like to be a werewolf and he knew Nate took after him. Eric on the other hand was really into minotaurs and so he wanted his youngest boy to experience that. As the family looked over the map, Doug could tell Ellen was chomping at the bit to get to Merfolk Lagoon, but the three of them were a bit confused because while they did want to check out Werebeast Woods, there wasn&#39;t really any specifications on the paper map in regards to what they would end up finding when they went there.<br />
<br />
Curious, Doug motioned for Nate to walk with him to go speak to the Minotaur to get more information about the activities there and where to go to experience them. As the two walked together, Doug leaned close to Nate&#39;s ear and spoke quietly. &quot;Hey Nate... you excited about exploring Werebeast Woods? Maybe run into a real werewolf? I know I am!&quot; He said with excitement in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... you want to engage with werewolves dad?!&quot; Nate replied, a bit confused, not sure what his dad was trying to pull when he thought that him and Eric would be doing their own thing and his dad and mom would try and rekindle their relationship.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah I do! There&#39;s nothing in the world like being a werewolf in my opinion and you know that Nate! How many werewolf movies have we both watched together and found ourselves... excited... over them? Hmmm?&quot; Doug said, implying that he knew Nate was sexually aroused by werewolves and that he was as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erhm... um... quite a lot dad, but... y-you&#39;re not mad... I um... I got... excited... over them?&quot; Nate said, not speaking toward his father&#39;s admission to liking guys as well, but then decided to take the plunge. &quot;You got pretty excited about them too. Is that why things with mom have fizzled out for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just before the duo got within speaking range of the minotaur, Doug decided it was best to tell Nate the truth now instead of later. &quot;To be honest kiddo... your mom and I have been... estranged... even in our own household together. I came out to her a long time ago, shortly after Eric was born, and told her that I had always been into men and being with her was more of a thing to keep my parents happy. They had to remain none-the-wiser... or otherwise... things in our lives as a family would have been far more complicated than they needed to be. So... your mother and I have been secretly seeing other people. She has been with another man that has made her happy, who she is meeting here in Merfolk Lagoon... and I have been seeing other men... men who told me about this place and especially Werebeast Woods. They also told me there is a special place for werewolves there, but I don&#39;t see it on the map... so I just thought it would be best to ask the guy who gave us our passes... plus we can inquire about where Eric can go to experience other minotaurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stunned and wide-eyed... Nate was beside himself about what his father had just come clean to him about. He always had several questions, questions that he never thought he&#39;d even be able to ask. Now that his father had openly told him he is basically gay, Nate didn&#39;t even have to. &quot;So... then what does that mean for us Dad? You like guys. I like guys. I am assuming you&#39;re ok with me exploring things sexually with a werewolf then? I am guessing you&#39;re going to do the same?&quot; Nate asked as they neared the minotaur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it have to mean anything for us Nate? Also... I am and I planned on it.&quot; He said with a big grin as they walked up to stand in front of the minotaur from earlier. &quot;Excuse me... erhm... Alexios...&quot; Doug said, clearing his throat as he looked at the minotaur&#39;s nametag. &quot;Could you, perhaps, help us with some things?&quot;<br />
<br />
The minotaur&#39;s attention was piqued, usually he didn&#39;t get to interact with guests more than just handing out the passes. &quot;Sure... I will bite. What do you need help with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... my son here and I are interested, specifically, in werewolves and my other boy is into minotaurs... like yourself. I know that Werebeast Woods is where we should go, but is there any place you would recommend for our particular interests? My wife is all set with Merfolk Lagoon, while we are kind of... lost.&quot; Doug said rather plainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... I see. Well... let me ask you two questions. The first is, since your family has the &#39;All In&#39; passes, that opens the door for sexual activities as well as non-sexual. Here at Mythtopia, we don&#39;t have age restrictions when it comes to our passes, that&#39;s up for the parents to decide. However, we are also law abiding here, so if sexual activities are to occur with underage patrons, they must drink something our people have concocted called &#39;Age Up&#39; which will age the imbiber to eighteen and make them truthfully legal. As for how it is done... it basically sets the body&#39;s internal clocks to being eighteen by manipulating their starting age. Depending on the person and their current age... it could set it back one, two or more years. So... for your son here, he&#39;s sixteen... I am assuming. So... it would set his internal clock to be as if he was born two years earlier. Your other kid, I am guessing is fourteen? He&#39;d be set for four years from when he was actually born. However, this would also mean skipped birthdays and both your sons would be eighteen. Now... since you are all set for the &#39;All In&#39; experience, I would assume you don&#39;t mind if your young sons enjoy themselves sexually then? Now, before you answer, here is my second question. What is the persuasion of you and your two sons?&quot; The minotaur asked with a knowing grin on his face, since he could clearly hear Doug and Nate talking when the wife and the other son... Eric... wouldn&#39;t have heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... erhm... yeah... we have always been open and honest with our kids and we felt that if they both wanted to do sexual stuff here, then it would be ok. Mythological creatures probably wouldn&#39;t have STIs or things of that nature... or would you?&quot; Doug said, asking for starters.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Myth-Folk do not have STIs as our immune systems are far stronger than what you humans have. However, I will warn you, exposure to sexual fluids by humans from Myth-Folk have permanent effects. The more you are exposed to it, the more myth-like you will become based on the ones who exposed you to it. For example, my cum would make any human into a minotaur, but it wouldn&#39;t be permanent, and unless you are exposed to more doses... you would return to being human. We have a &#39;de-mything&#39; serum that will regress your changes, which we strongly advise you endure a day before leaving Mythtopia... that way you can return to your human lives. If, however, you are exposed to several doses... well... then it becomes a bit more permanent and living in your pertinent zones is most recommended. For you and your son here... I heard you like werewolves... so there is something you should be aware of. In Mythtopia... there are two kinds. There are the anthro-wolf kind and then there are the werewolves as monsters... and depending on where you go, that&#39;s the kind that you will not only be exposed to, but also the kind you will become.&quot; The minotaur, Alexios, explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... that was going to be my next question. As for my boy Eric... we aren&#39;t sure what his persuasion is, yet, but if he is anything like Nate and I... I am sure he&#39;d be willing to help you... if you wanted it... that is. If not... we would just need to know the direction to where he can find other minotaurs. As for myself and Nate... we&#39;d go for werewolves as monsters... considering we both don&#39;t really enjoy the cutesy werewolf stuff out there now in popular media.&quot; Doug explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... well... if your boy, Eric, enjoys males... I&#39;d be glad to have him on his knees and give him a taste of my mino-milk! If not, when you get to Werebeast Woods, look for the sign that says &#39;Greek&#39; and it will lead him where he needs to go.&quot; He said with a hearty grin. &quot;As for you two... same thing, but when you get there, seek out &#39;Horror Hall&#39; as there is a sign post for that as well. I will tell you guys right now, going to &#39;Horror Hall&#39; is not for the faint of heart. They are truly monsters that love blood, gore and violence. Now... have fun!&quot; He said with a grin and a nod as Doug and Nate walked back toward Ellen and Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you think Eric would go for Alexios&#39; offer?&quot; Doug asked his son, assuming Nate would know more about Eric&#39;s persuasion as brothers tend to talk to brothers about such things far before a man&#39;s sons would speak with their fathers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly dad... Eric has been pretty curious about men far more than women, so... he probably would. Though, I also know Eric is way more curious about his options versus being set on any one option.&quot; Nate answered back, while silently wondering what it was going to be like taking &quot;Age Up&quot; in order to enjoy himself fully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh... I see. Honestly doesn&#39;t surprise me in the least he&#39;d be interested in men too... just like you are, but you are into men exclusively... isn&#39;t that right Nate?&quot; Doug asked as they drew closer to the family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I only like guys dad.&quot; Nate answered as they approached Ellen and Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... so according to our friend Alexios the Minotaur over there, we all have our heading. Ellen, I will see you later and go have fun at Merfolk Lagoon. Eric, Nate and I will be heading to Werebeast Woods!&quot; Doug said cheerfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright boys, you three have fun!&quot; Ellen said as she quickly made her way to Merfolk Lagoon, while the three males headed toward Alexios, waving goodbye to Ellen, considering he was right on the path to Werebeast Woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Eric... do you want to accompany us to Werebeast Woods or... would you like to spend time with Alexios? He offered to assist you in becoming a Minotaur...&quot; Doug said with a cheeky smile on his face, noticing Eric blush as he started to pop a tent in his shorts. &quot;Hey... hey... don&#39;t be ashamed if you want to be with a guy. You know your brother is ok with it and I am fine with it too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really dad?! Seriously?! You-you&#39;re ok with me being with another guy and you&#39;re fine with Nate being gay too? Man... I wish I would have known you were this open otherwise I would have come out to you sooner. Yeah... I would love to hang out with Alexios and get his help... though I am not sure of what that would entail, but I guess I will find out pretty soon!&quot; Eric said with a smile as the three males walked onward toward Alexios, where Doug and Nate would venture further.</p>
