<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they drive out the gates and down the street towards the town center, Ben turns to Jane, “so, I assume your parents have raised you into believing that snakes are either demons or witches in disguise”.<br />
<br />
“Correct,” Jane says, “they are strong believers and still believe that witches really exist. I know that there are people out there who participate in magic, voodoo and pagan stuff, however my whole family believes that those people are able to transform someone into a toad!”<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles and shakes his head, “some peoples minds are just… out there,” he says, “sure these people can put curses and spells on you, but none of them can literally transform someone into a toad, bug or some object. All they can do, when cursing someone, is to bring misfortune to the cursed person”.<br />
<br />
Jane nods, “yeah,” she says, “you know, all my life my parents told me what to do, how to dress, who to date,” the girl rolls her eyes, “I’m sick and tired of them controlling my life, especially… especially after what happened with my ex”.<br />
<br />
“Jane, you don’t need to tell me, it’s none of my business,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
Jane looks over at Ben, she then lets out a sigh, “I can sense the distrust and skepticism coming off of you, and I get it: why would a rich girl want anything to do with a “low class” person?”<br />
<br />
“I must admit, that thought did cross my mind,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
“I want to be honest with you Ben,” Jane says, “all the boys I dated, were and are just… psychos, they all, just like my parents, tried to control me and my life, not just verbally but also… physically”.<br />
<br />
“Eeesh… I’m sorry, Jane,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
Jane sighs, “whenever I go to the police and they prosecute these people I’ve dated, my parents get mad, they say I’M the evil one, how dare I send these “innocent” people to jail, all the bruises on my body I put there myself”. The girl clenches her fists, “I so sick and tired,” she says, “I honestly HATE my life, yes, I am rich, yes, I have everything I can dream of, but all that means nothing when you have to constantly live in fear, not only from people outside the family, but from the own family!”<br />
<br />
Ben can feel the girl’s frustration and anger, “listen, Jane,” he says, “thanks for telling me all this, I can sense that you are scared, not only of your exes but also of your own family”.<br />
<br />
“I wish I could just run away, but my family has connections, they’ll find me, no matter where I am or how well I am hidden”.<br />
<br />
Ben is silent for a while, ‘man, if she is just playing with my feelings, then she should get an Oscar for her performance,’ he thinks to himself, ‘but… I believe that she is being serious and I believe her’. The teen reaches over and takes Jane’s hand, the girl looks at the boy, “Jane, I promise to help you,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Oh really,” Jane asks, “I doubt you’ll be able to”.<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “oh, believe me,” he says, “I AM able to help you, not only that, but I’m also able to protect you from your exes and family, I promise, no one will ever be able to hurt you again, and all I am asking for is your trust”.<br />
<br />
“Then tell me: HOW are you planning to achieve all that,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “let’s enjoy our evening together,” he says, “I promise, I’ll tell you everything after the date”.<br />
<br />
Jane looks at the boy with scepsis in her eyes, but then she smiles, “alright, Ben,” she says, “something tells me to trust you, and I listen to my feelings”.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “your trust means a lot to me, Jane,” he says, “I promise, you will not regret it”.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, she then turns to look out the window at the setting sun, the girl chuckles, “I have a strong feeling, that after the date my life will not be the same”.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, ‘and you are absolutely right, Jane,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“By the way, Ben,” Jane then says, “your car really is the most comfiest I’ve ever been in, it’s so quiet and the seats are so comfortable, it’s so relaxing!”<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “I’m glad you like it,” he says, “it’s a one of a kind car… literally!”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben smirks, “I told you: AFTER the date,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jane pouts, “you are such a meanie!”<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “just a little,” he says, “but I promise you, it’s worth it!”<br />
<br />
Jane sighs, “fiiiiine,” she says, “by the way, where are we heading?”<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “you’ll see,” he says simply.<br />
<br />
Jane snorts, then laughs, “you really are a meanie,” she says, “why so secretive?”<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “I want this date to be unforgettable for both of us,” he says, “and I believe surprising you is the best way!”<br />
<br />
Jane rolls her eyes and shakes her head as she chuckles, “men”.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “sorry”.<br />
<br />
After driving for an hour, Ben pulls into a parking lot, shutting off the engine, “we’re here,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Where is “here”,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “you’ll see,” he says, before getting out the car and walking around to the passenger side, opening the door and holding out his hand.<br />
<br />
Jane takes Ben’s hand and steps out the car, her eyes then widen, “the reptile house,” she asks, looking at Ben.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “you said you want to face your fear,” he says, “and what better place to do that than the reptile house?”<br />
<br />
Jane looks at the huge building, feeling her nerves act up and she even begins to sweat a little, “isn’t… isn’t it closed at this time?”<br />
<br />
“For the public it is,” Ben says, “but not for us”.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben grins, “I know the director,” he says, “he’ll let us in”.<br />
<br />
Jane looks up at the building, the girl takes a deep breath, “alright… if I don’t face it now, I never will”.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “you are a strong woman, Jane,” he says, “you’ll manage and I’ll be there to support you”.<br />
<br />
The two walk towards the main entrance and Ben presses the door bell, “who is this,” a gruffy voice comes over the speaker.<br />
<br />
“Good evening, mister Porter,” Ben says, “this is Ben, you said whenever I need a favor I should come by”.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Ben,” the voice says, now sounding much friendlier, “what kind of favor would it be?”<br />
<br />
“I’m on a date,” Ben says, “she has fear of reptiles, but is willing to face that fear, so I thought that this would be the best place to come”.<br />
<br />
“I see,” the director says, “I’ll be down in a minute,” with that the line cuts.<br />
<br />
Ben turns and smiles at Jane, “see?”<br />
<br />
“I do,” Jane says, “but that sure is a huge favor you have asked for”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “yeah, but it’s appropriate”.<br />
<br />
Jane tilts her head, “how so?”<br />
<br />
Before Ben can answer, they see someone with a flashlight approaching from the other side of the large glass door.<br />
<br />
Mister Porter unlocks the door and opens it, smiling at them, “welcome,” he says, “please come in”.<br />
<br />
Ben and Jane step into the building and mister Porter locks the door behind them, “thanks, mister Porter,” Ben says, “I’d say, we are now even”.<br />
<br />
Mister Porter smiles, “sounds good to me,” he says, then turns to Jane, “before you ask, Ben here has prevented my son from being kidnapped”.<br />
<br />
Jane’s eyes widen, the girl turns to Ben, “long story,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
“Give me the short version,” Jane says.<br />
<br />
“Well, I was here with my class,” Ben says, “I saw a young boy with a woman, at first I thought nothing of it, but then I noticed the boy’s fear and the tight grip of the woman on his arm. At that time, I didn’t know what the reason was, all I knew was I needed to act, it just didn’t feel right”.<br />
<br />
“What did you do,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
“I spoke up and asked what the woman was doing with the boy,” Ben says, “she said that she is his mother and that he run off. However the boy immediately shook his head and said that it was not true, that he didn’t run off, that the woman simply stormed into the office of his dad while his dad was on the toilette, before he could continue the woman smacked him hard, she had a crazy look in her eyes”.<br />
<br />
“What happened then,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
“I raised my voice and told the woman to let go of the kid,” Ben says, “we argued back and forth, the woman continuing trying to get past me, but I continued to block her way, soon we were surrounded by other visitors”.<br />
<br />
“That is when I came running with two security guards,” mister Porter says.<br />
<br />
“Finally the woman let go of the boy, who run straight for his dad and the woman tried to escape, but she couldn’t get through the crowed and she was led away,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
“Who was the woman,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
“My ex-wife,” mister Porter says, “she’s currently in an insane asylum… I hope at least she still is”.<br />
<br />
Jane’s eyes widen, “wh-why?!”<br />
<br />
“Because SHE is sick,” mister Porter growls, his hands clenched into fists, “she claims that my son is in reality a girl, that his boy-parts are simply a birth defect”.<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Jane shouts, “how?”<br />
<br />
Mister Porter shrugs, “I have no idea, but something must have snapped in her brain,” he says, then sighs.<br />
<br />
“I am sorry,” Jane says, “how… how’s your son?”<br />
<br />
“He’s doing fine,” mister Porter says, “he’s in secure location”.<br />
<br />
“I just hope that crazy woman will never find him,” Ben says.<br />
<br />
“THAT is my fear,” mister Porter says, “I’m honestly considering leaving the country with my son and go into hiding”.<br />
<br />
Jane shakes her head, “and I thought my family was sick and crazy,” she mumbles.<br />
<br />
“Anyway,” Ben says, “let’s do what we came here for”.<br />
<br />
“Right, follow me,” mister Porter says.<br />
<br />
As Ben and Jane follow the director, Ben glance over at the man, noticing how tired, worried and stressed he seems to be, ‘I got to help them,’ he thinks to himself, “mister Porter,” Ben says, “I’d like to speak with you and your son, would it be okay if we could meet tomorrow?”<br />
<br />
Mister Porter looks at Ben, “what is it you want to talk about?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, sir, but I’d like to tell you when it’s just you, me and your son”.<br />
<br />
The director looks at Ben closely, “alright,” he then says, “let’s meet at 2pm in my office”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, smiling, “I promise, sir,” he says, “you’ll not regret it”.<br />
<br />
After an hour, Ben and Jane exit the building, Jane smiling wide, “I can’t believe I actually did it,” she says, “I actually held a snake and it felt nice!”<br />
<br />
Ben smiles, “I was able to see your fear simply vanish the moment you held the snake”.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles at Ben as they walk towards the “car”, “thanks, Ben,” she says, “without your support I’d never have overcome it”.<br />
<br />
Ben opens the passenger side door and helps Jane get in, the teen smiles, “I’m glad I could help”.<br />
<br />
“So, where are we heading next,” Jane asks.<br />
<br />
Ben climbs into the driver’s side, “well, I believe we both are pretty hungry, so I’d suggest we’ll drive to a nice restaurant, and I have the perfect one in mind”.<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “food does sound good,” she says, the then chuckles, “let me guess: we’re going to McDonald’s?”<br />
<br />
Ben snorts, “no, of course not,” he says, pulling out the parking lot and starts driving down the street, “I have something better in mind, something more appropriate!”<br />
<br />
“Oh? Now I’m curious,” Jane says.</p>
