<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I awake in the morning, drenched because I'd peed in my diaper, but the good news was that I was back in my normal frame of mind. Pushing the plush mouse away, I climb out of bed and looking into the mirror, I sigh in relief that at least I'd not under gone any more transformations while I was asleep.<br />
<br />
Glad because it’s the weekend, I take off my nightgown and threw it into the hamper. Pausing, I can see that I may have not undergone a change, but my closet certainly has been altered.<br />
<br />
The nightgowns mother bought the previous evening are now hanging up and on the only shelf in the closet, someone has stacked the diapers, pull-ups and the baby-powder. About than, I remembered what I'm wearing and taking off the urine soaked diaper, I dump it in the pink and white trash can next to my desk. As I look into the mirror, seeing my naked self reflecting back, I ask to myself, &quot;Am I going to do that every evening? Will I need a diaper or pull-up every night I go to bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coming up with no answer, I head for the bathroom and the shower.<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
I consider myself lucky as over the next several weeks I suffer no mind slips. Oh, I have the occasional odd thought whenever I'm around a girl or my sister, but I'm able to shake it off, but the big problem is Thomas still refusing to speak to me. School has been out for about two weeks now and summer has officially started today.<br />
<br />
I'm still five foot one, my hair is still soft, brown and reaches down past my shoulders, while my skin has grown even softer and my eyes have began to turn a bluish grey. The only real odd thing is that I must wear a diaper or pull-up at night, otherwise I'm likely to wet the bed; embarrassing, huh? Lying in my bed, feeling the Dry-Night hugging my flat and smooth crotch, happy that this was not one of the times when I wet myself, I think about what I should do today.<br />
<br />
Sitting up, I see Angelina Ballerina sitting on the nightstand, but I ignore the stuffed mouse as I look at the alarm clock. Currently the time is ten thirty and I decide that I should get up.<br />
<br />
Pulling off the pull-up, I dispose of it in the pink and white trash can and open my dresser. In the top drawer, I now have Hello Kitty and Angelina Ballerina underwear rolled up with my socks. Lately I've taken to washing my own clothes, just to keep mom from finding out that I've not only bought some little girl panties, but that I'm still wearing them. For some reason, by male underwear’s not really comfortable around my new genitalia.<br />
<br />
Taking out a pair of Angelina Ballerina underwear, I open the next drawer which contains shirts. Thankfully, they are all male, except for the light purple shirt with Tinker Bell on it, which to me is still a mystery as to why it wound up in with my clothes instead of back in Katherine's dresser. Taking a white short sleeved shirt, I close the drawer.<br />
<br />
Next, I open the drawer that holds my pants and shorts, also still male except for the tight pair of shorts that I'd worn all those weeks ago when mother had caught me. Taking out a pair of shorts, I close the drawer.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on my bed, I look at the clothes. I have a theory why I've not experienced any mind slips; I think it's because I've allow myself to wear certain girl’s clothes. The underwear I wear on a day to day basis, the diapers or the pull-ups I put on at night and then there is the fact that I sometime sleep with an Angelina Ballerina plush.<br />
<br />
Pulling on my panties, I'm still bothered on how they hug my crotch and enhance the view that I'm a girl. Next I pull on my shorts and use a belt to hold them in place. After that, I put on the shirt and go find breakfast.<br />
<br />
Seeing that Katherine and mother are still not up I get down a bowel and the cereal. Taking all of this to the dining room table, I sit down and begin to eat. After a bit, I'm joined by my sister, who I choose to ignore. Sitting there, eating her breakfast, feet swinging back and forth, hugging a doll, I all of a sudden realize that I'm staring. Katherine, seeing this, asks me, &quot;Are all right Marcus?&quot; Bothered by the fact that I'm staring, I hastily nod, jump up and rush to the kitchen with my now empty bowel and spoon. Dumping them into the sink, I rush outside, thinking to myself, &quot;Shit, I don't know how or why, but my mind began to slip again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Breathing in the summer air, I thought about going swimming, but the moment I thought about the one piece bathing suit with the pink and purple swirls on it that was rolled up in my closet and how cute I'd look in it, I pushed that idea aside and thought about going to the batting cages. &quot;Maybe I'll even see Thomas there,&quot; I gave attention to.<br />
<br />
Octagon Park was the only park near us. There’s the batting cage, a pool, a lake to swim in and for boats to use and a miniature golf range as well. Arriving, I start looking through the crowds for my best mate, but I don't see him. Spending some cash there, I pass the morning and part of the afternoon there before I think to head for home. On the way home, I take a detour, thinking that the best way to confront Thomas was at his home.<br />
<br />
Arriving on the block he lived on, I jog down to his house and stop dead in my tracks at the sight I behold. A large 'For Sale' sign sits in the front yard and on top of that there's a small sign that reads 'Sold'.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell,&quot; I think to myself. Upset that Thomas would go and move, I start walking home.<br />
<br />
At my house, I see mother's car is gone. Knowing that she now works the morning shift and only on weekdays, I briefly think to myself, &quot;Wonder she's gone?&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside, I see that Katherine is not present and walking to the bathroom, I sit down on the toilet to pee. It's then that I feel really strange and as I finish my business, my mind slips so badly, I'm unable to bring myself back.<br />
<br />
As if I'm in a dream, I see myself go to my room and remove all but my Angelina panties. Next I pick up my stuffed mouse and cradling her to my body, memories flood in of me doing this and playing with her my whole life. Still feeling like I'm sinking, I head for my sister's room and there I open the closet and remove a pair of pink tights and a matching body suit.<br />
<br />
Putting on the outfit, I spend the next hour and a half prancing around Katherine's room, lost in a sea of girlish tendencies. I play ballerina first with Angelina and then we play Tea Party and after that, still dressed as a ballerina, I play house with my plush mouse.<br />
<br />
After that, tired, I lay down on my sister's bed and snuggling closer to Angelina, I fall asleep.<br />
<br />
I awake to someone rushing into the room and sitting up, still lost in my girlish self and now feeling really groggy, I see my sister, who says to me, &quot;Oh, Marcus, you look oh so cute. You look like a real ballerina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shifting her sheets about, blushing at the compliment, Katherine presses on and asks me, &quot;Would you like to play dollies with me? You can invite Angelina if you want. Afterward, we can play dress-up or Tea-party if you want. Or we can watch a princess DvD.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling myself sinking, a strange ticklish sensation in my groin and abdomen, I giggle like a little girl and tell my sister, &quot;Angelina would love to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
We’re about to get out Katherine's dollies, when I hear from the door, &quot;Marcus Maurice Ericson! What the hell do you think you are doing? I thought you'd learned your lesson, but I guess that I was wrong.&quot; As a hand grabs me by the arm and starts to  drag me out of my sister's room, it comes to my attention mom had just seen me wearing my sister's ballerina costume.<br />
<br />
Sitting me down on my bed, she says in a stern voice, &quot;You're grounded for two weeks. And to make sure you don't do this again, you forbidden to go anywhere near your sister's room. Dammit, Marcus, I thought that I could trust you. Making you dress as a girl for an evening wasn't enough to scare you straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt the tears begin rolling down my face and looking at my mother, I said to her, &quot;I'll behave, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mother shook her head and in the same stern voice, she says, &quot;You’re grounded for two weeks. And on top of not being allowed near Katherine's room and to teach you what you’ve done is wrong, I'm going to make you wear girl's clothes for the next week. For the next week, you'll be known as Ashley. Maybe, this will keep from wearing your sister’s clothes&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears rolling down my cheeks, feeling really embarrassed, I hollered, &quot;Please, no. I'll be good, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother looks at me and finally she quietly explains, &quot;We’ll see. If you can be good, I may shorten your time as Ashley, but if you misbehave, I'll be forced to lengthen it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Crying harder, I nod at this and mother leaves. After a bit, she is back with Katherine's old clothes from when she was three. Opening my top drawer, mother swore loudly when she spied the underwear I'd been wearing lately. That bit cost me another week.<br />
<br />
Dressed as a girl against my will to teach me a lesson by my mom, I sit outside after she sent me out and thinking to myself, &quot;How can this get any worse?&quot; I pray silently that my mind will take another slip, but nothing happens; I’m a fifteen year old male, forced to wear his sister’s clothes for two weeks because of something I can’t control.<br />
<br />
After a bit, mother comes out with the laundry and tells me, “Ashley, your time as a girl will not be all fun and games. I have list of chores for you to complete,” and than she hands me a long list. Sighing, I set to work.</p>
