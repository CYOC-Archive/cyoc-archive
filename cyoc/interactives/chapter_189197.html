<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff felt a great sense of defeat as he pulled his hand back and the recognition that the only way he&#39;d be able to get out of the master bedroom of the Chapman house was as a Slug Person. He had some sense that transformation was going to happen eventually and there were even moments where he felt parts of it were already happening. For at the same time as he felt defeat, he seemed to also get some assurance in the back of his mind that seemed to be coming from his sisters, Lucy, Zoe, and Grace, and from his mother Whitney. It was very weak, but it was some indicator that elements of that transformation was happening and that he was starting to tap into the hive mind that linked all Slug People together. That, however, didn&#39;t remove the sense of defeat he felt about him and the worries that came with it.<br />
<br />
For when Megan and Jenny first came into the house, they displayed all the known behaviors that Slug People were known for, but at levels that hadn&#39;t been reported on outside of the specific communities and colonies that Slug People had, and almost without concern for whether or not it was welcome. Grace even said that forcibly transforming humans into Slug People was NOT something that Slug People condoned after her transformation. It likely represented whatever influence that Edward Cupple had over Megan and Jenny and what lead to Whitney being rather mindless and lust driven when she first transformed as well. Jeff could accept that he&#39;d been exposed to enough of that magic to lead to his transformation, and at times there was certainly the incentive to want to, but he wanted to keep things on his own terms, particularly when Grace and then Zoe and Lucy showed all the sorts of things that made them who they were before Megan and Jenny&#39;s initial visit after their transformations.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still our brother and still will be,&quot; Lucy said to Jeff as she put a hand on her brother&#39;s shoulder, &quot;and we&#39;ll still love you in the way we always have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I know,&quot; Jeff answered as he looked over to her, &quot;though... there are some things that scare me a bit. I mean... what if I end up a Slug Woman...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll help you learn to balance yourself with your new breasts if that happens,&quot; Zoe teased, &quot;just as you can help us adjust to having penises as well as a vagina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff slowly nodded a bit, remembering that Slug Women were hermaphrodites and that only the rarer Slug Men only had one gender. There was a part of him that would prefer to remain male, and it was that part of him that had some nervous about the possibility that he&#39;d become a Slug Woman when his transformation happened. Sure, he&#39;d keep his penis, but he&#39;d also gain female reproductive organs as well and would likely also grow breasts. It was something that left him pondering what the right pronouns were for a true hermaphrodite and whether or not it was something he really wanted. Though the assurance from Zoe, even if it was in a teasing way, put him a little more at ease on the issue. Though it was then that something broke that ease of comfort from where it had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Realizing you&#39;re truly trapped in there, aren&#39;t you, Jeff?&quot; came Megan&#39;s voice from outside the door to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
That alerted him to the door and reminded him, and all of the Chapmans in the room on who was directly responsible for their situation. The wizard, Edward Cupple, might be the the mastermind behind the plan and as such, Megan and Jenny might only be victims of his scheme, but for the moment they were the ones who had come in and bathed them all in the transformative magic that lead to Whitney&#39;s, Grace&#39;s, Zoe&#39;s, and then Lucy&#39;s transformations in that order. It was something that all of them could rally against for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t leave that room as a human,&quot; Jenny chimed in, &quot;you must join our hive and then you&#39;ll be free to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your family joined and they are free to go,&quot; Megan added.<br />
<br />
&quot;We aren&#39;t in YOUR hive,&quot; Grace said to the door and the two on the other side of it, feeling a bit of worn frustration at having to deal with the two Slug Women. Her temperament left her more inclined to see Megan and Jenny as victims of Cupple, but while they were carrying out Cupple&#39;s orders and commands, that really didn&#39;t matter. &quot;Our hive is based around real love. Not lust born out of some wizard&#39;s greed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are the only other Slug People here,&quot; Jenny warned, &quot;and the master can find ways to control you. And so long as you cling to Jeff... you are ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should already know that your master failed to control us!&quot; Lucy growled at the door, &quot;so you can take your victory in forcing us to all become Slug People. But we are NOT part of your hive, nor will we EVER be!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that now,&quot; Megan answered, &quot;but you haven&#39;t had sex as a Slug Person yet... and once that happens you&#39;ll want to be with us. As we are the only Slug People here. Particularly while you&#39;re defending your human brother...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human for now,&quot; Jenny corrected, &quot;for even that&#39;s on borrowed time. Eventually he&#39;ll become a Slug Man and will want to be with us... as all that lust in a new Slug Person will want to get started quickly with a big throbbing cock...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned and was uneasy with that. While he knew that Slug People naturally had a very high libido that easily exceeded humans and loved contact, the stories and reports he&#39;d read about also indicated that Slug People also weren&#39;t solely obsessed with these things, which was something that Megan and Jenny had seemed to be, even before they&#39;d begun to reason through the possible reasons why. At first it was something that he couldn&#39;t resist or didn&#39;t fully notice until Whitney started transforming, but once that was recognized it was something that unnerved him. It was like Megan and Jenny solely wanted him for sex and nothing more than that and the fact that they also made statements on how he would do the same with his sisters and mother was also unnerving. Slug People may have had some magical protection against inbreeding, but that didn&#39;t mean he wanted that for himself or his sisters.<br />
<br />
That only made the situation ever more frustrating with Megan and Jenny still present. They&#39;d tried all they could to get at him through the door, and even tried going around to come in through the windows when his mother and sisters went to get food. Ultimately Megan and Jenny were pushed out, but between either help from their wizard master or because the front or back door wasn&#39;t locked they&#39;d been able to come back in and were now messing with them through the door... again. It left him feeling trapped and nervous, for with the main door shut and locked, there was no way any of them could see if Cupple was with Megan and Jenny and thus a great deal of uncertainty remained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may end up a Slug Woman,&quot; Jeff commented, &quot;though either way... I am not yours and nor will I be. Those I&#39;d want to be with romantically... start a family with... it should be someone I love, not just someone who is horny and available.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your transformation hasn&#39;t completed yet,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and we can tell by your scent that a lot of all this turns you on. You want to experience it. To complete your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be able to defend my family and stop whatever plans your master has,&quot; Jeff spoke as he managed to stand up, and feeling some of the united confidence coming from his sisters, &quot;and if that means becoming a Slug Person... I&#39;ll accept that. But keep in mind that your master is not invincible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Megan answered, &quot;but then you can&#39;t defeat him as you are... or even after your transformation is completed. Nor will the churches in the area help you. They&#39;re all largely wedded to their own beliefs on how we&#39;re wicked Satanists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One can never know for sure,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;as they&#39;ve also tolerated the existence of Slug People.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad you&#39;ll never get to ask them...&quot; Jenny countered, &quot;for you&#39;ll be joining our hive.&quot;<br />
<br />
The end of the sentence lacked some of the confidence that the earlier taunts had, but Jeff also knew that they were all in pickle. His family had to stay together so the Cupple couldn&#39;t overpower the hive mind that linked his mother and sisters together and they couldn&#39;t leave him because of what Megan and Jenny would do without his family being present to protect him. And as he&#39;d recently found... he couldn&#39;t leave the room if he remained human.</p>
