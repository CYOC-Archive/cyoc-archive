<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He aimed the camera at the babies, who&#39;s minds have seemingly adjusted with reality as they happily gurgled away. He aimed the picture, but before he could take it his hands vanished. He tried to catch the camera with his feet but he only through it in the air upside down as he vanished completely.<br />
<br />
The camera fell to the ground, and in a sudden struck of luck, the camera landed on it&#39;s button and snapped a photo of the two babies. They both simply laughed at the strange box as a photo popped out. Reality was about to shift again, but would the only one aware of the changes come back?<br />
<br />
After what felt like an hour of holding his breath, Jake felt himself come into being once again. It was impossible to describe what had happened. Previously he had seen his hands vanish, and as that had happened all sensation went with it. The next minute, he thought nothing, saw nothing, felt nothing. Then, he was back, standing in his home&#39;s hall, just as he had before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was... weird.&quot; He muttered to himself. &quot;I-I guess the camera took a new pic.&quot; He thought, glancing down at the camera. Suddenly his eyes shot wide upon remembering why he had nearly vanished from reality in the first place. &quot;MOM AND DAD!&quot; He thought in a panic. After swiftly yet carefully picking up the camera, he leaned over to glance inside his parents bedroom, making sure to stay just out of sight. <br />
<br />
Jake let out a sigh of relief. The first thing he saw were his two parents, Patrick and Nancy, standing in the middle of the room and back to their proper ages. Jake was so happy, he nearly jumped for joy there and then. However, this joy was short lived as a few odd things caught his eye.<br />
<br />
His father looked mostly the same, except his red curly hair was now much shorter on his head, and he had a small, neatly trimmed beard across his face. His mother, however, seemed more off. Her long black hair was now a bob cut, her usual casual clothing was replaced by an elegant red dress, and she appeared to have much more jewelry all around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jakes mother began, &quot;we better all get back downstairs. Dinner should be ready soon.&quot; She announced.<br />
<br />
Jake was weirded out. She was a full blooded Italian-American so she NEVER talked so quiet and calm. That&#39;s when the added word struck him. &quot;Wait, all who?&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
As if to answer his question, two people emerged from the other side of the room, initially obscured from Jake&#39;s sight by the door he hid behind. One was a tall African American man, the other was a short and plump asian woman. The man was bald, wore a nice flannel with dark jeans and a crisp pair of glasses. The woman was wearing a dress in similar fashion to his mother alongside a stylish purse and acrylic nails.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re definitely right baby.&quot; The man said. To Jake&#39;s total shock, he wrapped one arm around his mother&#39;s waist, pulled her in close and gave her a passionate kiss. <br />
<br />
Jake was in shock, then turned to his father, expecting him to be ready to fight this guy, but instead Jake was greeted with yet another shock. His father leant down, and was also kissing the woman who Jake had never seen before.<br />
<br />
Jake backed away from the room, trying to process everything he had seen. It was clear that the camera was magic, and WAY too powerful. Somehow, it brought his parents back to mostly normal, but now they were married to different people. Were their personalities changed? Were they slightly younger or different ages?<br />
<br />
As Jake walked away and down the hall, he began to spot family photos around the house which had changed. The first he spotted was an old college pic. It used to depict his parents at the party where they met, but now showed both Patrick hugging the new woman and Nancy kissing the man passionately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... so, so they fell in love with different people?&quot; He muttered aloud. &quot;Or, maybe they didn&#39;t meet in time? Oh god... wait, who am I the son of?! I can&#39;t be Mom and Dad&#39;s I gotta be one plus whoever those new people are... What about Luke and Lizzy, did they still exist or were they erased?! Did I change? Who even lives here now?!&quot; He thought, his mind racing at a thousand miles an hour.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t bring himself to check himself, so decided there was one picture on the wall that would settle it all; the family portrait. Or, rather, a family portrait.<br />
<br />
Jake dashed over, still holding the camera that had caused all of this tightly, then glanced up at the photo... there, he saw...<br />
<br />
What does the family of that house look like? Who changed? What siblings are there? What happens next?!</p>
