<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Can I help you with anything?” The cashier asked, startling Evelyn,<br />
“S-sorry!?” She replied, spinning to face the teen cashier, chewing on bubblegum, hair tied up messily. She clearly didn’t care a lot about her job, but maybe she could help, “uhm, I’m looking for a pair of shorts— a large pair of shorts… like in a large size, for large… y’know,” she stuttered,<br />
“Plus size shorts?” The cashier asked,<br />
“I wouldn’t say plus size, more like…” Evelyn trailed on, catching the cashiers disinterested gaze, “y-yeah, plus size shorts,”<br />
“Let me show you,” she said, slipping her cell-phone into her pocket. She left her little desk and passed Evelyn into a corner of the shop. Evelyn followed, looking over the shoulder of the cashier into a selection of shorts that were definitely too small for Layla’s posterior,<br />
“These any good?”<br />
“No, a little bigger,”<br />
“Right,” the cashier said, looking behind the shorts, seeing if she could find a larger size, “how large exactly?”<br />
“Uhm… I don’t know,” Evelyn said.<br />
The cashier grabbed a pair of pretty large shorts, but still not big enough to fit Layla,<br />
“This any good?”<br />
“I think they’re a little…” Evelyn said, but hesitated before saying, “t-they’re fine, I think we can make them work,”<br />
“Great,” the cashier said, “wish I could fit into these like your friend,” she said without much thought,<br />
“W-what?” Evelyn questioned awkwardly,<br />
“I said I wish I could fit into these shorts,” she said slightly louder,<br />
“O-oh right,” Evelyn replied, nodding awkwardly, “sure,” she finished.<br />
“Let me know if you need anything else,” she said kindly, but immediately grabbing her phone out of her pocket and returning to her little desk.<br />
<br />
“Alright, I wish…” Evelyn started, “I wish these shorts were the right size for Layla,” she whispered, hoping the cashier wouldn’t hear her.<br />
She watched as the shorts began to expand in her hand. It didn’t feel like they were just getting larger, it felt as though they were being remade, like each fibre was being woven again to suit the wish she had made. She was amazed, this ring could really do anything.<br />
Looking at the perfectly sized shorts, she impulsively whispered, “I wish the cashier could also fit into these shorts,” with a smirk on her face. Why not do a good deed with the power she suddenly possessed, right?<br />
<br />
She turned around to approach Layla’s changing room, but caught a glimpse of the cashier. She looked over at her, noticing something,<br />
“Oh shit,” Evelyn said, realising her mistake. The cashier’s body was bloating, getting larger and larger by the second. She couldn&#39;t quite see her lower half but she knew it was going to grow as big as Layla’s, but with her body following!<br />
Evelyn watched as her button-up shirt got tighter and tighter, stretching against her huge belly before suddenly,<br />
POP!<br />
A button flew off, the cashier didn’t seem to notice,<br />
POP!<br />
Another flew off,<br />
POP!<br />
POP!<br />
Two more, Evelyn couldn&#39;t take her eyes off of her, watching her whole body expanding, her face getting larger, puffier, fatter! It was mesmerising.<br />
<br />
“Evelyn!” A voice called. Evelyn quickly turned to face the voice, seeing Layla trying to get her to come over. With disappointment, she followed her girlfriend into the changing room.<br />
Layla was in her underwear, hoping Evelyn would have something at least somewhat close to her size,<br />
“This should be perfect!” Evelyn said, handing over the large pair of shorts,<br />
“Oh my god!” Layla said, “i-it’s…” she looked amazed, “I had no idea this store did my size!”<br />
“Y-yeah… pretty hard to find, but they had ‘em,”<br />
“I’m so relieved!” She announced, letting out a breath.<br />
<br />
Evelyn looked at Layla trying her best to manoeuvre around with two people in one stall,<br />
“I can step outside of you want?”<br />
“Y-yeah, thanks. I don’t mind you seeing me in my panties… there’s just not a lot of room,”<br />
<br />
Evelyn stepped out from the behind the curtain, creeping a view of the cashier. She was definitely a lot bigger than she was before, Evelyn could’ve guessed she was over twice her original size (and likely weight).<br />
“Th-thanks for the help…” Evelyn said, approaching the cashier,<br />
“What?” She asked dismissively, but smiled afterwards, placing her phone on the desk, “no problem, I’m happy to help. I’ve always liked fashion and clothing,”<br />
“Right?” Evelyn said, “actually, could I ask for some advice?”<br />
“Sure,” the cashier said.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“These fit perfectly!” Layla said, stepping out of the changing room, “I can’t believe you managed to find it in this store, I always imagined…” Layla stopped, looking at Evelyn.<br />
“Like it?” Evelyn asked. She was stood against a mirror with the cashier beside her. She was wearing a beautiful blue dress that really complimented her figure perfectly, almost as if it was made for her,<br />
“Wow…” Layla said, looking speechless, “it’s… amazing!”<br />
“Thanks,” Evelyn said, blushing at her girlfriends compliment,<br />
“I can’t believe just how well this fit her,” the cashier started, her buttons miraculously sewn back on like magic,<br />
“It really is wonderful,” Layla said, averting her gaze to the cashier, “I don’t think we’ve met?” Layla asked,<br />
“She helped me find you those shorts,”<br />
“Oh!” Layla, “thank you so much, they fit perfectly!”<br />
“Don’t worry about it. I was saying I wish I could fit into those…” the cashier started, but lost herself, “b-but… I guess… but I could fit into them,” she looked immensely puzzled, “I-I don’t have any idea… why I said that…” she had completely lost her focus,<br />
“O-oh… uhm,” Evelyn said, realising her wish had confused the cashier beyond understanding, “w-what’s your name?”<br />
“Huh?”<br />
“I-I never asked your name!?” Evelyn said, desperately trying to change the subject. Layla could tell something was up, but she kept it to herself,<br />
“Oh, right… I’m Trisha,”<br />
“Thank you Trisha, we really appreciate all the help you’ve given us,”<br />
“R-right, no problem!”<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
At the counter, now changed into her original clothes, Evelyn was purchasing the dress and the shorts. She realised she definitely didn’t have enough money to pay for them. So with a smirk, she simply said,<br />
“I wish I had my wallet full of money in my back pocket,” she finished. It was an awkward sentence that everyone heard, and the silence was very uncomfortable. Evelyn reached into her back pocket and found exactly what she’d wished for.<br />
<br />
She took out $300 for the dress, $40 for the shorts, and decided to give over $200 to Trisha for her help… and compensation for her dramatic change in appearance.<br />
<br />
“I hope to see you two again!” Trisha called to them, dazzled by the amount of money in her hands. The two waved at her as they exited the shop, but Layla wasn’t staying silent much longer.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“I know for a fact you don’t have five-hundred-and-forty dollars to throw around… what’s going on right now?” She asked very seriously, confronting Evelyn directly.<br />
Evelyn, for the first time in a while, looked over Layla’s body. Standing in front of her was what used to be her fairly short, fairly pudgy, sweet and unassuming girlfriend. Now, she was looking at a woman with large breast implants, one of the largest rears she’d ever seen on anyone before, especially for her small frame. This power really had changed reality, and with almost no consequence to her actions. She’d made a cashier double in size with a simple mistake in her words. And nobody had any idea what was going on.<br />
At the very least, she felt if she was going to tell anyone, it was going to be Layla…<br />
<br />
She was conflicted. She didn’t know what she was going to do!</p>
