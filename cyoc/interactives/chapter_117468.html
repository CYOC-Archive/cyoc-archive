<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, what are you trying to do Kyle?&quot; Jen asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Just choose one, quickly!&quot; Kyle said pressuring Jen<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh....uh...ummm...&quot; Jen said stressed<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late, now you get both transform and dare.&quot; Kyle said<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jen asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Just listen, for your transformation you will become a giant humanoid dragon god, and just so we&#39;re clear a god and goddess are different. You will be six stories tall, be anthropomorphic and retain all of your normal abilities. However, everyone except for me will believe that you have existed since the beginning of time, and your parents will become your personal servants. Your body will outclass every athlete in existence, and your reptilian dick will be half the size of your entire body. As a god your role will be to populate the dragon community by transforming people into dragons, and giving them traditional dragon instincts. Your dick cannot be sheathed so you will keep it out as well as your testicles, and you will be able to grant others immortality. Others will look to you when they want to have children, and dragons will worship you by mating every year. As you transform nobody will know and nobody will be harmed, but everyone will know your presence, and swear loyalty to you. Nobody will know the truth except for me about your past as a human girl. As for your dare, you will do as I command and grant me anything that I wish.&quot; Kyle said<br />
<br />
&quot;Really Kyle...&quot; Jen said unamused<br />
<br />
&quot;See you soon,&quot; Kyle said then hung up<br />
<br />
Jen sighed then got ready for school, when suddenly her chest started to burn like a rash. Jen didn&#39;t know what was happening to her, but when she took of her shirt to see what was happening she saw navy blue scales forming across her body. Jen started freaking out, and she now noticed that she was growing as the scales were spreading across her body. Jen then fell to the ground and she saw her breasts shrink giving her a flat chest, and she began seeing muscles bulge. Jen also noticed that she was developing bat-like wings and a tail, and she ripped through ger clothes as she grew. Jen&#39;s shoulders broadened and Jen was now about the size of her room, until suddenly the floor collapsed beneath her giant feet that were beginning to look like giant claws. As Jen grew her features became more apparent, as her hands changed into 3 digit claws retaining their thumbs, and her feet had 3 toes and giant claws all claws black. Just then Jen had a growth spirt and her entire body grew up and destroyed her house, and her face was beginning to develop a muzzle. Jen&#39;s hair then fell out and she grew two black horns on the back of her head, and her muzzle finished growing in. Jen&#39;s teeth became sharp like razors, her tongue was forked, and her eye pupils became slits. Jen hadn&#39;t been paying attention to the scales as they were now completely covering her body, and her wings stretched over at least 3 blocks of houses each. Jen&#39;s tail was now about two thirds the size of her body and now dragged behind her and she could move it easily. Jen&#39;s wings were the same way, and she was awed by them until a sudden pressure caused her to moan extremely loud over the entire city. Jen watched as a dick forced its way out of her vagina accompanied by two gigantic balls that were the size of two mini-vans each. The dick then pushed its way out and Jen could now lift it up to her, or rather his face now and it sprang to life erect in his claws. <br />
<br />
When Jen finally stopped growing he was standing in the center of a street and could look over multiple houses and neighborhoods easily. Jen&#39;s body was now extremely muscular, and athletic more than anyone he could imagine. Jen held his dick in one claw and cupped one of his balls in the other and it throbbed and he moaned in a masculine voice as it produced a drop of cum that while small, it had the diameter of the street&#39;s width and it snaked its way to the ground on a band of pre-cum. <br />
<br />
Jen then had a compulsive desire to find Kyle, so he took a few steps to the school and sat down on a slope near the parking lot and looking over the entire thing and placing his dick on the ground where it&#39;s erection destroyed the sidewalk and dug a cylindrical hole in front of a car. Jen waited there for about an hour when he felt like something tiny was poking his balls, and he looked down to see Kyle punching one of them. Jen then sat up and Kyle looked up and said,&quot;About time you took notice, I was there for about ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want Kyle? I&#39;m not in the best mood today if you haven&#39;t noticed.&quot; Jen growled in a masculine threatening tone<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sorry about that Zantor, I can&#39;t make myself that much more noticeable for you.&quot; Kyle said<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough, also Zantor really? Couldn&#39;t come up with a more creative name?&quot; Jen, or Zantor asked annoyed <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I didn&#39;t exactly plan this for a couple days, so let&#39;s just cut to the chase. You are going to get me out of school today, and you&#39;re going to take me wherever you go.&quot; Kyle said<br />
<br />
Something in Zantor refused for him to say no, so he just sighed. &quot;Whatever you say, just don&#39;t annoy me today, or rather for the next week or month. I don&#39;t really care, I&#39;m just pissed off right now.&quot; Zantor said annoyed again.<br />
<br />
Just then the principal Mr. Ralph came out and saw Zantor with Kyle, and rushed over to them. &quot;Uh...um,&quot; Mr. Ralph said nervously <br />
<br />
Zantor sighed and said,&quot;Greetings, what kind of trouble are you having today with mating and such?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, Lord Zantor I was just here because you have one of our students, Kyle is supposed to go to school regularly. In fact Kyle is required to attend daily, I&#39;m not sure how it works for you, but I will excuse him if it was important, or punish him if his annoyances are bothering you.&quot; Mr. Ralph asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, Kyle is interested in what I do as a god, and I wish to give him a visual demonstration of my power. Of course it won&#39;t be on him, but he won&#39;t be required to attend school today because of that.&quot; Zantor said<br />
<br />
&quot;B..but we&#39;re conducting state tests that each student is required to take.&quot; Mr. Ralph said<br />
<br />
&quot;And you as the principal shall tell the state that they can wait, and if they don&#39;t believe you then consider that there must be many listening to my words and what I&#39;m saying and they can vouch for you. That is unless you are questioning my authority over yours in which case I will happily aplage to end things for you right now.&quot; Zantor said<br />
<br />
&quot;N..no, of course not Lord Zantor do what you will, and I will attend to my own duties.&quot; Mr. Ralph said then walked away, and Zantor picked up Kyle and put the tiny human on his shoulder and walked off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have liked if you destroyed the school to prove your strength.&quot; Kyle said<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You realize that I would end up killing everyone inside the school right? Besides it&#39;s unnecessary and pointless. Now, tell me what I&#39;m supposed to do.&quot; Zantor said whispering which was about as quite as a normal person talking.</p>
