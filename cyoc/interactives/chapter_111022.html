<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harold studied Dean for a bit as he considered the offer to sit down and talk things through rationally.  There was a part of him that wanted to get away from the college, grab his daughter from school, and run away as far as he could.  Yet, there was another part of him that urged caution, and to think through things rationally.  This part of him won out over the former.  Harold sat down and studied Dean for a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Dean said as Harold sat back down, &quot;Now, let&#39;s start with what you already know.&quot;  Harold explained the happenings with Samantha, followed with his meeting with Virginia McCoy.  &quot;Ah, Virginia.  She&#39;s a nice woman and a good weretiger.  I hear she&#39;s still single.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you know Virginia?&quot; Harold asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she and I are part of the same pride, if you will.  We see each other pretty regularly during our meetings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you...&quot; Harold asked looking a bit worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weretiger?&quot; Dean finished with a bit of a smile.  &quot;Yes, I am a weretiger.  I moved here to take this job 7 years ago, and it was a difficult decision.  But, it&#39;s not one that I regret.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold looked a bit shaken, unsure of how to take the news.  He then asked, &quot;So, how many others know about this secret?  That this town is full of these...were things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, just about all of the faculty know.  Even those who live outside of Moon Lake, but we make them sign a waiver.  Many in this town are a were of some variety.  Majority are werewolves, as those seem to be quite popular.  But there are others, such as weretigers, werebadgers, weremers, werecows, werebulls, and others.  Although...&quot;  Dean paused as he picked up the pamphlet and thumbed through it.  &quot;This pamphlet is a bit light on the information, but it does explain some of the basics.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;So, why do I or Melissa have to change?&quot; Harold asked.  &quot;I mean, couldn&#39;t I just sign a waiver and be done with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean shook his head as he explained, &quot;Unfortunately not.  Because you moved into this town, it means that you are now a resident.  And, as part of the law of this town, you or Melissa...your daughter I presume?&quot;  Harold nodded his head, &quot;Okay, well you or Melissa has to join a community of weres.  The reason for this is to protect the secret of this town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, right, Virginia mentioned something like that.  It&#39;s to ensure that no one in this town would reveal the secret without risking their own lives or the lives of people they love.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s correct,&quot; Dean replied.  &quot;We&#39;ve had problems in the past with a family of normals living in town and the council thought it was too much of a risk of a reveal.  The worst thing that could happen to this town is for the existence of weres to be revealed to the world before the world is ready.  History is filled with examples of people discovering a town full of weres only for those people to hunt and kill every last one of those weres in town.  Roanoak is an example of this.  History books will tell you that the colony of Roanoak mysteriously disappeared.  The truth, though, was that was a colony founded by weres to escape persecution in Europe.  When people found about the colony, though, they killed everyone in the colony, normal and were alike.  They then covered it up saying that it was attacked by native Americans, and leaving it a bit of a mystery.  Our history is filled with examples like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Harold said, his eyebrows raising up. <br />
<br />
Dean nodded as he continued, &quot;If you want, you could go down to the special library and see for yourself.  Suffice it to say that we take our secret very seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Harold continued, &quot;What&#39;s it like?  Being a weretiger and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so bad, really,&quot; Dean answered with a smile, &quot;We get to live for a very long time.  Most weres can live to be 400 or so, but the aging process doesn&#39;t really start till about 300.  We have more strength and energy as a were, and we can heal from just about anything.  Although, we do have an allergy from silver, and a gunshot wound can kill just about anyone, were and normal alike.  But changing feels like a bit of a...rush.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold&#39;s eyes popped open and he asked, &quot;So, how does one join a were community, or become a were?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Dean answered as he thought about his answer.  &quot;There are three main ways.  First is by being bitten by a were.  Second is by being scratched by a were.  Last is having sex with a were.  Most people choose that last options, for obvious reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; Harold replied, looking a bit embarrassed.  <br />
<br />
Dean grinned as he continued, &quot;Don&#39;t be so bashful.  Weres here are a bit open about their own sexuality, although we do like to think we have a sense of what&#39;s appropriate.  Anyway, we weres have a close relationship with each other.  It&#39;s even closer with weres of the same type, although it&#39;s closest with family, regardless of family members.  Although I was born as a weretiger, it&#39;s something that I&#39;m proud of, and I wouldn&#39;t trade it for anything in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Harold replied as he thought about what the Dean said.  &quot;So, what do I do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did the right thing by coming here and discussing things with me.  I&#39;ll have a chat to Samantha about her approach.  What I would suggest is to take time in the library and read up on the history of weres.  Also, I&#39;d suggest you learn about the different groups of weres here.  If you or Melissa is going to join one, it&#39;d be good to get a bit more detail on which group either one of you will join.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One more question,&quot; Harold asked, &quot;What would happen if Melissa and I didn&#39;t join a group?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean frowned and had a serious look on his face.  &quot;If that were to happen, the council would want to meet with you.  They would then, depending on your answer, could decide to have to join a community against your will.  It&#39;s never really happened in the time that I&#39;ve been here in the town, but I wouldn&#39;t want that to happen to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I see,&quot; Harold replied, taking a bit of a gulp of air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and one more thing.  There&#39;s been a situation with a student also named Harold Jenkins.  He and a Jennifer Harper are to be married this Saturday, but there&#39;s been a few...issues so to speak.  While I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no danger to you, but just be careful.  At least until Saturday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...Ok.  Thank you,&quot; Harold replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, if there&#39;s nothing else, you&#39;re free to leave now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.  If I have any further questions, I&#39;ll be sure to come to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anytime, and stay safe out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Harold left Dean&#39;s office and made his way to the library to do some research.<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
More foreshadowing!  But what&#39;s being foreshadowed exactly?  You&#39;ll have to figure that one out.<br />
Also, Harold&#39;s daughter is Melissa, not Melanie.  Although, both could be shortened to Mel.</p>
