<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Monika and I finally fell asleep around 2am after quite a few hours of fun. It was as if we both were in heat as no matter how many rounds we went, we just could never have enough of each other and after a short while, would be right back at it again. I had to remind Monika not to wake up early in the morning as for the rest of the week, as she wasn&#39;t my maid until next week. She felt a bit saddened by the idea, but cheered right back up when I said she would instead be spending her morning in bed with me. I also set up one of our other maids, a recent hire named Libby, who was just here for part time work as she attended college. She was convenient since she worked only in the mornings and nights since durring the day she attended her classes. Monika and I agreed that Libby was to wake us both up no latter tha. 8:30am if we are not up already. <br />
<br />
I awoke silently and checking the clock, I saw that I only had a few minutes to go until 8am. Monika was still fast asleep too. Both of us were fully naked as well. Looking over the room, I could see the aftermath of our night if fun. Our clothes werr thrown about everywhere, a chair had been knocked on its back, condom wrappers scattered across the floor, etc. All of it was just a testimony as to how much sex we had last night. I eagerly wait watching the clock as it finally reaches 8am. <br />
<br />
Suddenly my entire body tingles pleasantly. Apparently it was the same for Monika too as she let out a moan and woke up, still a bit sleepy. &quot;Hmhmhm Good morning Sir. You were quite excellent last night.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Monika, and you were perfect as well. And remember that we are on a break. So you don&#39;t have to be formal; actually I would prefer it if you were very casual with me. I doubt that after what we did last night, that we could continue to be considered just in a master/servant relationship anymore.&quot; Monika nods, understanding what you were implying &quot;S-sure thing, um, h-honey&quot;  she says a bit nervously. Honestly, I was only expecting her to drop the sir and use my name, but there&#39;s no way in hell that I am going to correct her. If she is comfortable with moving right into pet names, then I am fully on board. <br />
<br />
I roll over to fully face her, and she continues to look at me. We just smiled at eachother until she finally began to laugh.  &quot;Hey, I never realized this before, but you have sone seriously long eyelashes. I am super jealous.&quot; Now that she mentioned it, I indeed noticed that slightly more of my view was now blocked by my eyelashes. I guess the changes have already begun. I could actually feel my insides shifting a bit, but nothing enough to cause me discomfort. However it was apparent that I was growing, slowly but surely, more and more feminine features. Monika didn&#39;t seem to be changing too much, but then again she didn&#39;t get nearly as many changed as I gave myself. <br />
<br />
I could now feel the skin on my chest changed as all of the chest hair I had disappeared, leaving behind a smooth, flawlessly, soft skin which nkw was slightly pushing out a bit behind my nipples. It would seem that I now technically have breasts, but am just so flat chested at the moment to really tell. On a side not, my nipples were also very hard due to the consistently increasing sensitivity the entire area was getting. From the outside though almost nothing was overly different. <br />
<br />
&quot;So my eye lashes are a enviable are they?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very. I will bet any girl would love to have them. Oh, uh, but they look fine on you.&quot; <br />
<br />
I knew what she meant, but this was too good of an opportunity. &quot;Sounds like you may need a bit of punishment for that.&quot; Hearing this, Monika became very excited. Playing along, she sat up and turned her back towards me as she slipped into a kneeling position with her ass raised and her face down on the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, did you mean to say that?&quot; I ask as I too take up position behind her to spank her ass. &quot;Mooooooo, I didn&#39;t.&quot; Monika wined, suddenly breaking the mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you just moo?&quot; I asked, stifling a laugh. &quot;I-I may have. But I don&#39;t know why I did. It just sorta came out.&quot; Monika embarrassingly admitted. Neither of us was in the mood anymore, but it wasn&#39;t too big of a deal for me since I knew why she moo&#39;d. Timing wise though, it was a perfect point to stop as a knock came from the door, as it opened up. <br />
<br />
Libby was here for our wakeup call and was pushing a cart along with her. &quot;Good morning Mistress, Miss Monika.&quot; Libby said as she pushed the cart over to my side of the bed. Monika now had a stern look on her face. &quot;Libby, that is no way to address your superior.&quot; <br />
<br />
Confused, Libby tried to understand what it was that she did wrong. &quot;Oh, I am so sorry!&quot; She said, backing away from the cart. Now standing in front of the bed, Libby redid her greeting &quot;Good morning Mistress, Miss Monika&quot;. The only difference this time was now she did a curtsy as she said it. This only made Monika furious. However before she could lash out at Libby again, I intervened, and cut her off. &quot;Thank you Libby. Your curtsy has improved.&quot; Monika now was looking at me. So I grab her hand and whisper &quot;Could you just let it go. She is still somewhat new and is likely very nervous.&quot; This caused Monika to sigh and relax. &quot;Alright, I am suppose to be on break anyways.&quot;<br />
<br />
Libby walked back over to the cart and opened the side doors below the surface, pulling out 2 hand fulls of tubing, each ending in a clear suction cup. 8 cups in total now lay ontop of the cart. &quot;Are you ready Mistress for your morning milking? Or should I begin with Miss Monika first?&quot;</p>
