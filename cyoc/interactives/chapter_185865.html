<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zeke knew he probably should tell his dad where his phone - the Chronivac included - was.<br />
<br />
But his mind ventured to all the things he could use this thing for. All the people he could change. So for now, he decided to indulge himself and kept quiet about it, &quot;Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve seen it, dad.&quot; He left no hint of his involvement. He watched his dad just shrug his shoulders, those boulders as impressive as ever, and then went to go pump some iron while he was feeling it. Zeke admitted as he rubbed his head that much as he enjoyed the idea, he would not be changing his dad any more. Though even still, thinking of Jake as his dad and Zeke himself as the son was somewhat...odd. Was there some sort of other change that occurred before...?<br />
<br />
Ah whatever, Zeke felt like a million bucks, and he decided the first place he&#39;d make use of the Chronivac would be at school the next day.<br />
<br />
He could already picture the mischief he could get up to. Slow transformations, fast transformations, people reckoning with them in different ways, and then reverting later - much later in some cases, or outright changing their &quot;reality&quot;, and mucking with their awareness. It was a power trip, to be sure, but Zeke wondered how far was too far. He decided not to make too much of a disruption.<br />
<br />
He decided to join his dad in the home gym, keeping the Chronivac equipped phone under his bed, where he could pick it up at any time. Whereas his dad was doing leg day today, Zeke went ahead and hit chest and shoulders. He swore as he watched his shoulders pump with blood following some shoulder press that he almost remembered being shy - of all things - about showing this body off. Dressed in a tank top as is, Zeke took his shirt off and continued.<br />
<br />
His eyes drifted to his dad doing some squats. The short shorts his dad wore to the workout were tight - way too tight. It was almost lewd the way that the shorts grew tight and strained by the powerful muscled ass that showed every dimple when he squatted down to full extension. His manhood was even slightly visible, and Zeke blushed a little when he realized his dad was visibly half hard. He turned his eyes away.<br />
<br />
After all, they were related, and while they were both men, Zeke wasn&#39;t exactly interested in seeing that.<br />
<br />
By the time they finished that evening, both went to the showers - and Zeke beat off as usual as he showered the sweat off. It was almost a ritual at this point - hit the gym hard, do as much as he could, then when he had the time to himself, just enjoy his body and jerk it to his own good looks. It was a private vanity he didn&#39;t extend to the rest of his behavior. He was cocky, confident for sure, but he didn&#39;t act obnoxiously preening when around others.<br />
<br />
By the time he was done, he walked past his dad&#39;s room, clad only in a towel to cover his modesty.<br />
<br />
His dad seemed to be using his room&#39;s adjoined shower room too. Zeke blushed again when he heard a moan, perhaps indicating, like father like son, he was not the only one to enjoy a wank after a workout. Zeke headed into his room, and after a few hours he went to sleep, excitedly thinking about what he could do with the Chronivac tomorrow.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
The next day, Zeke made his way to school, and inspiration hit him as he walked in to the front of the school, seeing the clique of Danny, Nate and Brad heading to class. They were three of the varsity jocks, and while Zeke didn&#39;t play he knew them well enough from the gym to know how he wanted to change them. Danny was overeager to grow up, and had obviously the previous year started dosing on...something. The way his trapezius muscles bulged up like that didn&#39;t exactly leave much room for lying. His face was prematurely aged a bit by the influence therein, but he didn&#39;t seem to mind. His black hair was styled short and slicked back, and with his strong jawline, dashing blue eyes and masculine features, some said he looked like a Hollywood movie star.<br />
<br />
Nate on the other hand was a shorter guy who reaped the benefits of being not exactly the tallest, to contrast with Danny being 6 foot 4 inches tall. Thickly muscled and with a strong core, but standing only five foot nine inches tall, Nate had his long light brown hair combed to the side, but cut short on one side, giving him a distinct look. Nate was a bachelor - a religious man who, while he didn&#39;t begrudge the others their playboy ways, preferred to wait till marriage for sex. His pretty, effete features kind of contrasted against his powerfully muscled body.<br />
<br />
Brad was a man with something of a complex - he was the one out of the clique who most often went out with women, and trained the most heavily. This was due to how Brad looked naturally. The Out teens at the school found that Brad looked very much like a twink typically, and it had taken the better part of three years of work to attain a look that didn&#39;t so strongly send a message. He however had completely internalized this issue, and so had become very defensive of his masculinity and how much he had sex. It didn&#39;t help that it seemed the &quot;doth protest too much&quot; effect was visible - he might prefer women overwhelmingly, but Zeke had noticed he ALSO looked a bit long at the other guys.<br />
<br />
Considering his options, he loaded up the Chronivac and scanned their data - Straight, Straight and Bisexual (Preferring Women) as he thought. It seemed according to the data that Danny had started a stronger dosage of whatever steroids he was on lately, hoping to add a bit more brawn still to show off even more. And who was Zeke to begrudge him that? He decided to start with Danny.<br />
<br />
Loading up a transformation, Zeke decided to have Danny, always eager for maturity and good looks, start aging one year every hour he was at school, with each year keeping up with his, ahem, usage. It&#39;d be interesting to see how Danny handled that. And how long before people found him kind of odd looking attending school like that.<br />
<br />
Next was Nate, and Zeke felt a sense of mischief when he saw that apparently Nate had a reasonably strong libido he was trying to deal with. The good Christian boy could do with some unwinding. So Zeke went ahead and strengthened the jock&#39;s libido even further, and added another clause - Nate would put on ten pounds of muscle every time he indulged his sexuality. It was time to see just how strong Nate&#39;s sense of restraint was.<br />
<br />
And last was Brad - and Zeke knew what to do with him. He went ahead and added 30 lbs of muscle to Brad&#39;s body over the course of the school day, the varsity player would also however be growing prettier despite putting on all that muscle. And like Nate, his libido would be growing stronger and more insistent. Zeke knew this was a bit strong of a prank, so he decided against adding absolute compulsions. More just letting the guys deal.<br />
<br />
In the interest of this being more fair, Zeke went ahead and scheduled the changes to mostly fade by the next day. Mostly.<br />
<br />
As Zeke headed to his first class, which would include Nate and Danny, Zeke also saw Chris Jensen, one of the school&#39;s nerds, clad in a jacket, a loose polo shirt, and jeans. Chris never really had much luck with women, being considered too skinny, gawky and awkward to be a plausible partner. Zeke felt bad for the ginger boy with blocky glasses and hazel colored eyes, so he went ahead, loaded Chris&#39; profile, and started work.<br />
<br />
He added 40 lbs of muscle to Chris&#39; 125 lbs body, deciding to see how he responded to this. Zeke knew he&#39;d be slightly late, but it was worth it as he watched Chris pause, and cover his groin with his hand. All of a sudden as he pressed his back - and backpack - against the row of lockers on the wall, Chris felt hot. Like something was heating up within him as Zeke watched. The shirt that was so billowing this morning was suddenly a deal tighter, pecs and abs pushing out where none existed so strongly before. Chris groaned as he tried to get room in his shirt sleeves - his biceps and triceps growing in size.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39; legs pulsed and almost sent him to his knees, his quads and thighs making far less room in his jeans. Likewise, he found himself really having to cover his groin as his cock grew harder - and a bit larger. His shoulders grew enough to damage the seam lines on his shirt, his back widening out...and then it stopped. Chris gulped and adjusted his glasses. His features filled out during this and became a bit less awkward and thin. &quot;What the...? What happened to me?&quot; Chris murmured. He was still every bit a nerd personality wise and such - after all, Zeke only added muscle to him, he didn&#39;t change reality or anything.<br />
<br />
Poor Chris, standing there erect as could be, more muscled than he&#39;d ever been. Maybe he&#39;d have better luck with the ladies now!<br />
<br />
But it&#39;d be interesting to see, likewise, how Chris adjusted. Zeke also remembered having a few classes with Chris. So it&#39;d be fun to see how things changed in his self presentation - and whether Zeke should add a bit more muscle to him. A bit.</p>
