<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The situation would be essentially hopeless if Mark allowed herself to fall into too much anger and resentment revolving around her sister and what through her mother she had done to her. Once her mother had left with the remote and her bratty sister now sporting her former male body had finished sticking her tongue at Mark and ran off Mark went up to her sister’s room and looked in the full length mirror to consider her options. Decked out in the pink sweater and brown skirt she also noticed a large amount of makeup applied on her face in an obvious attempt by her sister to look overly beautiful for school as girls her age usually do. Until a short time ago this was not her sister as Heidi would have never been caught in an outfit like this unless either her mother had forced her into it or she was expected to go to some formal event or party and again her mother, father, or relative had forced her into it. Knowing and growing up with Heidi was like growing up with another brother in the family at thirteen years old Heidi was growing into a beautiful young woman but if Mark before his swap had ever told her that he would have stumbled away with a bloody nose. Everything she did was as masculine as possible whether it be wearing only pants, cargo shorts, and jeans, playing rough sports with Mark and the boys in the neighborhood, watching sports, and refusing to wear anything feminine or act in a way that was in accordance with her birth gender. Heidi acting this way turned into a tough sell for her mother who always wanted a girl to baby and doll up when Heidi was little but that wish had never turned into anything concrete as the years rolled by. Still Mark felt that her mother hoped it was just a long drawn-out faze that Heidi was working through and eventually she would accept her place in the world as a girl.<br />
<br />
Remembering the long, loud fights her mother and father had with Heidi over many nights through the years is something that never left Mark. Subject matter ranging from her clothes choices, and refusal to play with and befriend the other girls in her age group seemed to track on forever and Mark remembered the particularly brutal anger emanating from her room one night a year ago when Heidi was caught attempting to cut her hair and both of her parents forbid her from ever doing such a thing as the consequences would be substantial. This restriction on her life sent Heidi into a rage induced stew that didn&#39;t subside for many hours and the majority of her spewing hatred emanating from her mouth went right into Mark’s parents who got whittled down to exhaustion answering her back with their own anger. Heidi’s parents knew that this type of relationship they had with their daughter was self-destructive to its core and that it couldn&#39;t stand for much longer with the way things were going. Heidi Mark suspected felt the same way.<br />
<br />
This outfit and the makeup applied to her face which was now Marks was once so anti-Heidi that she had to do a double-take several times as she stared at the sight before her. Through all the anger and rage she produced at her parents and the unfair place she was expected to stand in the world Mark suspected that she would never accept her femininity. Then like the flip of a switch six months ago her sister and her attitude to being a girl flew from one side to the other in what seemed like a miracle overnight switch. Suddenly Heidi wanted all girl clothes and wanted to be shown how to apply makeup and act more like a girl. That change also included a double-take from Mark at the time but in pressing Heidi for answers all she got was answers to screw off.<br />
<br />
Still she was just as much a boy trapped in a girls body as Heidi was months before this predicament but even more so when referring to being trapped she wasn’t going to be caught dead wearing this outfit especially with how alien it felt on her body. Not wearing anything on her legs and expecting people to not pay any attention to her was going to take some getting used to. Certainly of course Mark wasn’t going to have to get used to anything because she wasn’t gonna wear this outfit and embarrass herself navigating the world in it.  Moving to the dresser burrow to the side of the closet with the full-length mirror hanging on the door Mark was just about to open it when she heard her mother downstairs yelling her sister&#39;s name <br />
<br />
&quot;Heidi time to leave for school, Martha&#39;s here to walk with you like you called her about, I&#39;m sending her up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn&quot; Mark thought finding herself intrigued that the voice in her head was the same as Heidi&#39;s and not her male voice. Even though her sister liked hanging with the guys and was a tomboy through and through she had still struck up a friendship with the across the street neighbor&#39;s daughter Martha a short time before turning girly. Martha was slightly taller in height then Heidi but redheaded. The only reason Martha and Heidi had become friends in the first place was because Martha enjoyed watching sports like volleyball, hockey, baseball and soccer like Heidi but that was where the similarities ended as Martha was very girly and Mark suspected that through Martha’s good friendship with her Heidi would and in fact eventually did appreciate the true side of the coin and begin acting more like a girl should. Either way Mark was now that friend whom she admired looking exactly the way both she and Heidi’s mother prayed she would come around to living as. Blindsiding Mark with this popping over Martha was just the icing on the cake for the start of this nightmare. Grabbing hold of the dresser knobs Mark began to pull the draw open hopping to change clothes before Martha arrived but that plan was dashed as before she could even open the wooden panels an inch she heard a knock on the door, and a squeaky voice called out:<br />
<br />
&quot;Heidi you in there?&quot; and even before Mark could have a chance to think of a reply the door swung open revealing Heidi&#39;s friend Martha standing in the doorway.</p>
