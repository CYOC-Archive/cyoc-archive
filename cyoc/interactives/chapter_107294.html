<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor&#39;s brother looked back to where little Trevor had stood a moment ago, blushing like crazy and showing off his cherry red ass. He was pleased to see that it had worked. But he wanted to make sure that everything had gone right with the plan. With a few careful settings on the remote, he went ahead and made it so that, only for half a second, he would feel as Trevor felt. He pushed save.<br />
<br />
It felt as if someone spanked him on his bare ass with everything they could right there and then. He yelped. But that was the least of his concern. The mind numbing panic erased almost all thought from his mind. It was a whirlwind of emotion. Betrayal. Fear. Pain. Humiliation. Oh, god, the humiliation! Imagine the feeling of going to show and tell at school completely naked. That was the feeling Trevor would have if he just saw himself in the mirror alone. No, this was unimaginable.<br />
<br />
That half second seemed to last much longer than it should. When it was over, Trevor&#39;s brother collapsed gasping to his knees. No. No. No. This wouldn&#39;t do. If left alone, Trevor would only escape into insanity before long. That would ruin everything. He set to work, “fixing” Trevor further.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trevor had materialized in the middle of a punchbowl. The feeling of the liquid on his body sent shivers through his spine, but it did nothing to sooth the glowing from his spankings. He looked around to see the entire wedding congregation staring at him. He could literally feel them watching him. Every set of eyes. It must have been another cruel feature to his brother&#39;s programing of him. All the eyes compounded and intensified the experience making it even more humiliating then with his parents.<br />
<br />
And, of course, Trevor&#39;s body took over. He found himself smiling mischievously at the crowd. Running a finger across his punch drenched body and licking it clean with a face of ecstasy. Inviting all watching to please come lick it all off him. Cute little pants and lustful moans escaped his lips as he changed his pose to show them all his cherry red ass. As if saying, yes I have been a bad boy.<br />
<br />
Of course, those inviting sounds were simply the result of Trevor&#39;s attempts at crying out in panic. The more he cried out the more perverted his moans became. The more horror he tried to express, the sluttier his expression became. His mind was numb with shock and he was sure he was moments away from fainting from the intensity of it. All of a sudden, the fog of his mind lifted. Nothing had changed. He was still just as humiliated as before, but now he could think. Or more accurately, experience without distraction. He wasn&#39;t about to faint anymore either. His mind was free to drink in every sensation to its fullest and to reflect on the horrible reality he found himself in with no delusion what so ever. It was pure, stark, inescapable reality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trevor&#39;s brother smiled to himself as he pushed the save button. Now Trevor wouldn&#39;t be able to escape into his own head. He&#39;d be forced to be fully aware of all that was happening to him at all times. In addition, he fixed it so that Trevor would never need sleep either. Can&#39;t let him have a break. Ever. This torment would be constant and unending.<br />
<br />
But something was still off. Trevor&#39;s brother thought hard about that maelstrom of emotions and sensations he&#39;d felt for that split second. It had been horrible, yes, but beneath it all, there had also been a slight pleasure. He remembered how his brother now reacted to the slightest touch with euphoric ecstasy. He rather liked that feature. It added to the humiliation. But it was also a bit too rewarding. He couldn&#39;t let Trevor start enjoying what was happening to him. Even if it was just a little. But taking away that feature was not something he wanted. In fact, for this additional punishment, perhaps his horniness should be even higher.<br />
<br />
He went ahead and made the adjustments. While doing so, he thought of yet another danger. It wasn&#39;t as if it would be easy for Trevor to ask for mercy or help in his condition, but it was still a risk. It was a real possibility that despite it all, someone would instinctively try to help him. Or show him kindness. A few subtle alterations to reality should fix that up. Now, anyone who saw Trevor would loose any sympathy or moral inhibition about him. In fact, they&#39;re first thoughts would be that here was a boy that needed to be punished and humiliated. They&#39;d also feel powerfully aroused by him and feel dominant. There. With that other adjustment, Trevor&#39;s life should be a lot more frustrating and humiliating for him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite it all, Trevor was feeling incredibly turned on by all the eyes watching him. Yes, he wanted more than anything in the world for this nightmare to end, but he also wanted to cum like crazy. It made him blush with shame even more, if that was possible.<br />
<br />
A man came over. The groove, Trevor realized. He couldn&#39;t help but notice who was doing what to him now. The man took a lick off of Trevor&#39;s body. If his body wasn&#39;t forcefully held in place to show off, Trevor would have collapsed in a convulsive fit from that. Yet all he could do was give encouraging mews and gasps. More people came over to taste his supple body. Trevor was amazed he hadn&#39;t orgasmed already. The guests and groom all continued to feast on Trevor. Some biting his nipples. Other&#39;s licking his privets. Trevor would have gone insane at that moment, if he could have. Yet all he could do was be completely and fully conscious of each and every lip, tooth and tongue on him. Even their breaths on his skin were too much to bare. One man was now sucking greedily on his dick. Trevor wanted to scream. He was so horny. Yet not only did he not cum. He couldn&#39;t even get erect. It just stayed humiliatingly small and flaccid and right at the edge of orgasm.<br />
<br />
No. Not at the edge of orgasm. He was way past that point. It was as if the barrier to how horny he could get had been removed with his ability to climax. The frustration was unlike anything he&#39;d ever known!<br />
<br />
All along, the wedding photographer snapped picture after picture of the molestation. Trevor giving laude and suggestive expressions and looking with a shy smile right into the lens. An expression that said, let the world see me.</p>
