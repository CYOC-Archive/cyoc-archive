<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ah... Um...&quot; Matt started to feel himself regain consciousness. &quot;What happened?&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;I was with... the Doc... And then I... was on the floor? Yeah.... Why was I on the floor?&quot; &quot;Matt?!&quot; &quot;Think Matthew... What happened?&quot; &quot;Matt?! Brother?!&quot; &quot;What...?&quot; Matt could see again. Above him was a cold metallic ceiling. He tried to move, but couldn&#39;t, the sound of metals grinding in his ear. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; Matt regained full consciousness and saw to his horror that he was chained up. And not only that, he was stark naked. He lay atop a cold metallic bed. His 6 inch flaccid cock was out in the open. &quot;Brother!!&quot; Matt heard a familiar voice. He turned to his side and there was his little bro, likewise naked. &quot;Kyle?! Holy... Moly!&quot; &quot;Matt... What&#39;s going on?! I&#39;m scared!&quot; &quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Matt stared at disbelief at his brother and noticed something stranger. Kyle&#39;s penis was covered by his own boxers and he could see his own clothes to Kyle&#39;s right. He looked towards his left and likewise saw Kyle&#39;s clothes. &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why I&#39;m glad you asked!&quot; A voice called out to the two siblings. They looked towards the voice and saw their physician and his assistant come through the door. &quot;Doc?! What&#39;s going on?!&quot; Matt was confused, when suddenly he remembered how he fell unconscious. &quot;You bastard! Oh you are so dead!!&quot; Matt roared out. Kyle was in tears. &quot;I see you remembered your little fall.&quot; &quot;I sure did! You&#39;re gonna regret it!!&quot; &quot;Am I? I see you have forgotten your little predicament.&quot; &quot;Doctor Schneider lifted to chains up. They seemed to stretch as if they were made of elastic. &quot;Shit!&quot; Matt suddenly realized that the doctor called the shots. He was powerless. &quot;Oh my god! Please, let me go! I&#39;ll do whatever you want, but please let me go!&quot; Schneider simply smirked at him. &quot;And what of your brother will you let him take your place. &quot;I... I...&quot; &quot;No need to answer. I realize how little you appreciate your little sibling. And I thought why not kill two birds with one stone! You help me in my grand experiment and I can you use it to help your fractured sibling relationship. &quot;Experiment? What do you plan to do with us?&quot; &quot;Again, I&#39;m glad you asked. See the purple vial in my hands. It used to be blue you see, but I&#39;ve added your brother&#39;s red blood to the mix. And the vial in my assistant&#39;s hands used your blood.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t understand. What does that mean?&quot; &quot;Imagine with me a world where you can literally change your DNA to another. In most fiction, these body swaps are what they are called. And thanks to this concoction, I can inject Kyle&#39;s DNA into you and vice versa and obtain the worlds first body swap.&quot; The tables moved up slightly so the Doctor could see his patients better. &quot;That&#39;s crazy! There&#39;s no way that can happen!&quot; &quot;Oh but it can. It worked on the chimps and it can work on you.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t believe you! Is this some kind of dream?!&quot; &quot;Oh I&#39;m afraid its all reality.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah,ah... What the hell?!&quot; Matt watched in horror as Schneider was getting him hard. &quot;What the hell?! Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah... Oh god! Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; &quot;Brother?!&quot; &quot;You have a nice penis don&#39;t you Matt. I&#39;m sorry to say it won&#39;t look this good for awhile.&quot; &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah... You disgusting freak! Ahhhhhhhh!&quot; Schneider suddenly let go. Matt&#39;s dick was leaking pre-cum and was hard at a foot. &quot;Look at that Kyle. You get to have that soon. You get to have all that.&quot; Schneider was near euphoric now. Kyle was in shock, but in all that confusion he did admire actually getting a body like Matt&#39;s. &quot;Kyle... I&#39;m sorry you have to see this... Ahh....... Ahh!&quot; Without warning Doctor Schneider inject to serum into his dick. The pain was great. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah....&quot; Suddenly Matt&#39;s body couldn&#39;t take it. He convulsed as his dick started to erupt. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah... Don&#39;t look Kyle! I&#39;m gonna... gonna cummmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot; Matt ejaculated. To Kyle it looked like he was peeing white snot. &quot;Oh god!&quot; Matt was completely embarrassed. Here he was, cumming in front of his own kid brother. His dick started to go limp again. &quot;Shit!&quot; Matt could cry, but he was in for more of a shock. His dick passed the 6 inch mark. That wasn&#39;t all. His balls were getting smaller, the hair receding into his scrotum. His dick was like a little kid. It was 2 inches long now looking strange leaking pre-cum. &quot;Holy crap!&quot; It actually happened. He had a little kid dick. &quot;It worked! Elena!&quot; &quot;Elena went toward Kyle. &quot;No! I don&#39;t wanna!&quot; &quot;Dammit! Leave him alone!&quot; &quot;Silence! We are in the presence of a scientific breakthrough!&quot; Don&#39;t worry Kyle. It won&#39;t hurt that much. Your brother was just... sensitive is all.&quot; Elena tried to reassure Kyle. She was quite good at those things. Kyle squirmed but he didn&#39;t yell. Elena took the serum and inject it into Kyle&#39;s penis through the boxers. &quot;Ah! Ow!&quot; &quot;It&#39;s done now Honey. Look at your pee-pee now.&quot; Kyle opened his eyes and watched as his pee-pee grew ever so slightly. He could see hair come out from under his balls, his balls also growing in size. His penis went from 2 inches to 4 to 6. His body felt hot. The penis continued to grew, getting harder. &quot;My pee-pee!&quot; Kyle proclaimed. Matt looked onward and saw a mushroom shaped object spring forth from the top of the boxers. &quot;Holy shit!&quot; &quot;My oh my!&quot; Schneider let out. &quot;It seem getting an adult penis is having an effect.&quot; Kyle&#39;s new equipment kept growing reaching a respectable 1 foot long. Matt couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. His 10 year old brother was getting an erection. Suddenly Kyle started to convulse. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah... My body feels funny! Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah...&quot; &quot;Fucking hell!&quot; Matt was in more shock then he though possible. &quot;Brother...! I think... Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah... I think I&#39;m doing that cum thingie... Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; Suddenly Kyle&#39;s new penis ejaculated white hot cum. A ten year old was cumming. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah... This feels so good!&quot; And he was turned on as well. Everyone was quiet until Schneider broke the silence. &quot;It... It worked! Elena! Let&#39;s us make history!&quot; &quot;Ye... Yes Doctor!&quot; &quot;No! No, stop!&quot; Matt struggled in vain from what was to happen. &quot;Wow...&quot; Meanwhile Kyle was in awe at what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will start from the feet up, understood?!&quot; &quot;Yes Doctor!&quot; Schneider injected the serum into Matt&#39;s bare feet. &quot;Ah!&quot; He felt it all. Elena did the same with Kyle, but he was so memorized by his dick, he let out no sound. Matt&#39;s feet were callused and as they shrank, his skin smoothed out. His toes looked smaller by the second. His feet looked like those of a baby. His ankles had shrunk to compensate. The opposite was true for Kyle. They became big and meaty. He wiggled his toes in awe as his ankles expanded to compensate his massive feet. Then came the legs. The chains that looked like they were elastic showed what it was really there for as his feet started moving towards his upper body. His well earned muscles contracting and his hair receding like his ball hair. The chains stretched so they wouldn&#39;t rip his body apart. Kyle felt as if the world was getting smaller. His puny legs were increasing in muscle as they caused him to grow up in height. Hair grew from his pores. Then the hands. Matt&#39;s hands grew smaller. He tried to flail them around in some desperate attempt to stop the process but it was in vain. Kyle&#39;s hands grew. Hair was appearing there was well. He gripped them, feeling new found strength. Then the arms. &quot;Please!&quot; Matt pleaded in vain. He couldn&#39;t watch anymore. His arms moved inwards, his biceps feel apart making both his arms look chubby, his skin hairless and pale. Kyle&#39;s arms stretched outwards. He flexed as his muscles formed, his skin tan and full of hair. &quot;Awesome!&quot; Second to last was the upper body. Matt&#39;s pecs collapsed on itself, spreading out. All his body hair was gone. His lack of a treasure trail lead to his small groin and even smaller cock. His eight pack abs disappeared one by one. His body was nothing more then and 18 year old head on a 10 year old body, Kyle watched in awe as his growth spurt continued. His stomach felt firm and he saw eight square shaped mounds of flesh appear. Hair formed on his pecs which likewise looked square shaped. He tired to play with them, making each pec move in and out. Hair formed there and lead down to his new found penis. Kyle was still shocked at how big and meaty it was now. And finally the heads. Schneider and Elena watched as Matt&#39;s hair receded into his scalp and his face become all chubby. His eyes turned green as his transformation to his kid brother was complete. Kyle&#39;s baby face was disappearing. His short cut hair was growing more and more. His eyes turned blue as his transformation into his hunky big brother was complete. &quot;Success!!!&quot; yelled out Doctor Schneider. The man had made history.</p>
