<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dymixious fumed as he continued walking; the were-dragon was in an ill mood and showed it well. After having to dispatch Lionel Ulysses; Dymixious was ordered to take himself and his wife Jade to Moon Lake general hospital. The obvious was to have Jade checked on as she was seven months pregnant with Dymixious’s first child. Yet the were-dragon knew the real reason; his father wanted him out of his compound in case the Feds or Seattle Police managed to I.D him.<br />
<br />
While Dymixious was clever when he infiltrated the hospital Lionel was recovering in; taking care not to kill anyone but his primary target, he knew knocking out an inattentive police officer just to accomplish his mission would mean trouble with law enforcement. But Dymixious didn’t care; all he cared was keeping were’s safe, no matter what it takes. So when he found out through his father that his compound was just raided by the FBI; Dymixious raged uncontrollably. All his skills and he couldn’t evade a simple security camera; keeping his head down as best he could, Dymixious was still I.D.ed. Now he had to hope his father’s friends were skilled at keeping him and Jade off the grid.<br />
<br />
Still, the were-dragon knew that he had no right to blow up at the two kids earlier; they were minding their own business and he did have a few things on his mind. Not liking the house his father set up for him was one of them.<br />
“Next door to the town Chancellor and her wife,” Dymixious swearing at his father when the old man called after he and his wife settled down.<br />
“Nosey bunch of were-cats,” Dymixious fumed; “why have us lay low next to them?”<br />
<br />
His father’s only answer was, “it was arraigned with the help of Tachibana No Akane. Deal with it.”<br />
“Great father,” Dymixious grumbles to himself; “anyone else know of our location?”<br />
<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Two men quietly observed from the woods as federal agents were swarming over the compound that Dymixious called home for the past several years. Watching with binoculars as the FBI brought out bags of evidence into their vans; the two men quietly retreat into the heavy brush and walk to their car. Parked at an abandoned logging road ten minutes away; one gets on a secured sat phone to make a call.<br />
“We arrived near Dymixious’s compound. The feds beat us to the place and are already collecting evidence how do we proceed?”<br />
<br />
A moment of silence from the first man transpires as the second comes back from behind a tree; zipping up his fly as he just relieved himself.<br />
“Very well; we will proceed with caution. Please forward our report to the watchers in Seattle.”<br />
The first man disconnects his call and looks at the second man.<br />
“We proceed to Moon Lake and get eyes on this Dymixious person.”<br />
“Is that where he is hiding,” the second man asking.<br />
“Yes,” the first man speaking; “but our orders are clear. We observe and nothing more. The Skulk are all over that town and the Luna Brotherhood has a long standing agreement not to step on their paws as they protect the town with the assistance of local law enforcement. Plus with the wedding of Harry Jenkins and Jenny Harper; the town is on edge with the bride’s family coming along with this Dieter bloke to disrupt the happy moment.”<br />
“Do they not know how dangerous this man is,” the second asking as they get in the car.<br />
“Apparently Dymixious’s father and Tachibana, the skulk leader have a history;” the first man speaking. “So the were-vixen most likely knows how dangerous this man is; the question you should be asking. Is Moon Lake’s local police force aware of Dymixious?”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
After their unpleasant encounter with Dymixious, both Tad and Amy agreed it was best to report the disturbing incident. Yet being so close to home, Tad wanted his mother to make sure he and Amy were fine. After the death of his father; Tad’s mother Jen was dealing with having to find a job. The Elder Decker’s pension would only help the struggling family so much. Hearing about Lionel’s capture after murdering Jen’s husband was a relief to both; however hear about the were-rat’s brutal murder while in police custody set them and the town on edge. Lionel’s tail showing after he got shot; shifting into his were-rat fursona on instinct, the whole act caught on a police officer’s body camera and making its rounds on the various social media sites.<br />
<br />
Tad watched the video and naturally growled in disgust; being a naturally born werewolf, he knew the danger of shifting during the daylight. His parents driving the whole point of secrecy as they too were weres; his father a werewolf but Tad’s mother was a were-cat. With his mother moving back to Moon lake, Tad was able to enjoy being in his fursona more freely. The town allowing for shifting after sunset and with plenty of woods to run through and explore; Tad was adjusting to the town quiet well.<br />
<br />
So when he and Amy stepped in the front door to see his mother cooking dinner; Tad felt relieved. His mother seeing Tad feeling worried stopped what she was doing to look at her son; See Amy also concerned, Jen had to say something.<br />
“Is everything all right; you two look like you saw a ghost.”<br />
“Mom,” Tad speaking; “I need to tell you something, it’s about a man we encountered.”<br />
“Who was he,” Jen looking at the two children.<br />
“He called himself Dymixious,” Amy speaking; “he was ranting and raving that if it wasn’t for him, we would have all been hunted down or some such nonsense.”<br />
“Mom,” Tad speaking; “he claimed he was the one who killed Lionel Uylesses.”</p>
