<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sometime in the near future...   <br />
<br />
Chris Harris was suspected by the FBI for being a Russian spy or Trump plant. He was named in several documents as being a hacker and connected to the Trump&#39;s campaign. They had him on watch lists and he couldn&#39;t leave the country when he wanted he had tried to go to court a number of times but he wasn&#39;t going anywhere. He hadn&#39;t expect Trump to win, it was a joke until the SOB won the election. <br />
<br />
He asked his lawyer to recommend a solution, his lawyer pointed him an expert who he had to make contact with a man called the &quot;Extractor&quot;. An unknown number texted him to a time and address, an appointment he supposed to an office in downtown DC with no furniture. He was asked to bring a million dollars in cash. If he failed then there would be no further contact the text said.  Chris told the heavily disguised Extractor what he wanted. Travel overseas without the FBI blocking him, he wanted something to turn the disguise on and know when it would wear off. <br />
<br />
He stood up as the Extractor took scans of his body and photos. <br />
<br />
Three months went by and nothing happened until another blocked number texted him an appointment this time the amount in cash was ten million. This time he did meet a dark haired beauty, an English girl with white skin, jet black hair, with at least a 32C chest and long legs. She wore form fitting black leggings and a grey business shirt without a bra. He got a hard on as he saw a nipple imprint through the thin fabric. <br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to be squirming Mr Harris, do you have a snake in your pants?&quot; she asked sweetly.<br />
<br />
Looking over him calculating eye he tried to hide his boner. She wore glasses that made her look like a cheering leading captain who also has a degree in marine biology.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I look like the man you meet nearly four months ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Chris gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; she tapped a long finger nail against her perfect white teeth &quot;because I am. Please remain calm, seeing is believing in our business.&quot;<br />
<br />
She lifted her shirt and allowed Chris to touch her breasts and even run a hand over her panties. He couldn&#39;t believe his luck!<br />
<br />
She pulled out a Chinese like gong and banged it. The noise ringing through the office. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please remain calm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly hair appeared on her smooth arms. She started to grow facial hair, five o&#39;clock shadow, but it became thicker, the bearded woman. Her shoulders started to widen as it stretch the fabric of her grey shirt. The breasts and nipples that so proudly pushed into her shirt was starting to stretch, becoming handfuls the nipples still point but less so than before. Her bubble butt started to become hard and made of muscle.<br />
<br />
She stood as the smooth crotch of her pants started to fill out with a penis and balls. The leggings ripped as toned legs appeared her long dark locks of hair became a man&#39;s business cut, short but functional. Soon he was staring at a male twin of the woman he had just touched as his eyes turned brown. The hair also developed grey in it and thinned on top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wish to touch my body and confirm that I am a man now?&quot; the Engineer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Chris muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good you can see that using a highly advanced process I can turn myself into a woman or back to my male self. Balding, 40s, still fit but starting to thicken down there. I can offer you one disguise, one woman. I worked for the CIA and what you would call MI6. They fired me because I took my work too far. Never mind, now I am in the private sector.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can turn me into that woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No she, Megan, is my display model.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then what can you turn me into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only females, I find attractive ones are the best for avoiding detection as they have a biological reaction to them as you just felt.&quot; the Extractor noted dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can you offer me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They have to be three things, one they have to be real people, two they have to left a DNA sample and thirdly they must be in the country. Megan was an exchange student from Oxford to Georgetown or something when I snatched her ID. I can&#39;t make you Rhianna or Gigi Hadith, those two would be the opposite of the service I provide. I use students or daughters of diplomats who look cute, have a valid passport and can bounce (like their chests Chris thought) through airport security.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the downsides?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Several: only one alternate version me/Megan, Megan is a real living person so anything that affects her body affects me when I turn, so if you develop a heroin habit as Megan (but you normally don&#39;t even smoke) when she takes over she will still have the same addiction even if I don&#39;t use her for six months, the change will last only 24 hours before you turn back and finally the trigger. In my case a gong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the trigger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was in the showers after working out some idiot had a similar sounding gong noise as his alert tone and well, I spent 24 hours as Megan in the showers of the local gym. No matter how rare the trigger I guarantee you that if you chose this form of disguise there will be accidents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the shelf life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The biological age of you/your Megan. It cannot be reversed and you must live your Megan as if she were Joan of Arc. If the Feds get onto your Megan you will be charged and convicted under your name of whatever you have done in your Megan&#39;s body. Plus your Megan will be suing your for abusing her body/DNA which after all is his &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have for me? The price?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten million for a full work up. You have the daughter of a minor Mexican diplomat who been here for 20 years, looks like Ugly Betty good if you want to not be noticed. Second you have a Swedish student who has and addiction to platinum blond hair, fake breasts and lots of working out at the gym. Thirdly you have a childless diplomat&#39;s wife from New Zealand, funny accent however she looks like an aged Lucy Lawless, can still rock a bikini but grey in her hair and she needs glasses to read. I like this model, little chance of interference from the Feds reduced hardons, but enough if needed and fourthly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Extractor took a sip of water.<br />
<br />
&quot;A Ukrainian teenager, legal age in her own country and here. Tall, dark brown hair, eyes and reasonable chest. This one dreams of being a model, so does the Swedish student.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both have active fan accounts on Instagram and bare their flesh. If Katya, whom as a Ukrainian hates Putin, f like her dear father, finds out Putin got killed and does a live stream from Red Square urinating on his grave. Meanwhile, you are using her ID in Washington DC, well awkward would be an understatement. I suggest the Mexican or the New Zealander&#39;s wife, both a low profile from countries that are mostly &#39;meh&#39; to other people. The others would require speaking a new language you don&#39;t know, yes I know you speak Spanish, with a Mexican teacher in school, Ukrainian is not Russian, you would have to learn the difference very fast.&quot; <br />
<br />
Each had a folder with their <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like Katya.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I suppose so&quot; he sighed &quot;I want another ten million dollars and a sample of your DNA. Here is a print off her social media accounts. Study them, Imagine that you are an actor who is going to not play but become say JFK. Well learn all about his life, his weaknesses and the fact that he wore a back brace and probably would have die of the syphilis if he hadn&#39;t been assassinated. You learn to become Katya if you have a &#39;gong&#39; moment like I did. I learned the accent and mannerism&quot; he slipped into Megan&#39;s accent &quot;so sorry chaps I think I stripped in the wrong showers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaking in his bland regional American accent he continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;ten million is the deposit, prepare another 50 million. If after six months you don&#39;t hear from me, or you have changed your cell number, then the deal is off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris sweated: &quot;Do I get my deposit back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Buyer beware.&quot; said the Extractor before showing as Megan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it was only good for 24 hours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had about an hour left, the gong just wrapped it up quickly, then I have another 24 hours as Megan but I will pay a price.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is the price?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her blue eyes pierced Chris as he knew he was dealing with the Extractor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use only once a month, many customers find that a full moon akin to a werewolf is actually the best form of trigger as it hits only once a month and you can plan around it, to use or not to use. Full moonlight to change and to leave the country, month away, full moon to change back and reenter Stateside.&quot;</p>
