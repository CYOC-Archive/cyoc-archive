<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Don put the plants into his bag, collected a few odds and ends, and headed out the door.  Dad had already left the house, and Brett and Bryan were getting things together for school.  Don managed to make it to his car and pull out of the driveway without being confronted by anyone.  Not that he was feeling guilty about anything.  Not that he even had anything to feel guilty about, he quickly insisted to himself.
<br />

<br />
Now Don had never paid much attention in biology, but he knew enough to stop at Home Depot and collect some potting soil, a tray, and some fertilizer.  For a moment he wondered how he was going to explain his sudden interest in plants to his roommate, Scott, but then he realized that Scott would be his first customer.  Problem solved!
<br />

<br />
As Don made it back to the campus, he started to have second thoughts.  What if Scott didn't see things the same way he did?  What if the plants couldn't grow inside?  He parked his car, and the doubts only grew.  If dad killed the crop at home, and his died in his room, he'd be screwed.  Walking up to the dorm, he noticed the ivy growing on the building.  Maybe he could plant just one of the plants outside, together with the ivy where it would be hidden.
<br />

<br />
Don waited until the coast was clear and then he quickly pulled one of the plants out and tried to stuff it into the ground.  Careful to not bruise it, Don managed to keep from getting any of the plant's fragrant fluids onto his hands.  He had taken his nose-plug out before going into the hardware store, and while the sweet aroma wafted up from the plant it was not overwhelming this time.
<br />

<br />
There was no hole, but he was surprised how easily the soil yielded when the roots touched down.  In no time, the plant had taken hold and swayed gently in the breeze next to the ivy.  Mission accomplished, Don sighed with relief.
<br />

<br />
Racing up the stairs two at a time, Don was soon opening the door to his own room.  He heard Scott snoring and tried to come in quietly.  His roommate was still asleep, his large, slighly overstuffed ex-footballer frame was laying on its back, on top of the covers naked.  Don quickly came in doors, not wanting to expose his roommate unnecessarily.  As he passed the bunks to step over to the window, Don's eyes lingered a little longer on Scott's big body than usual.  His roommate's cock was at &quot;full mast&quot;, whether that was the result of a horny dream or just pressure from his bladder couldn't be known, but Don hadn't seen his roommate fully hard before and he found himself drawn to the sight of another man's manhood
<br />

<br />
Don set his bag down and shook his head again.  Turning away, he wondered what he was thinking.  He had never been interested in men's bodies before... what was going on?  Frowning, he turned his attention back to his future riches.  As quietly as he could, he set up shop along the windowsill, carefully potting and fertilizing each plant.  Although he was being quiet about it, at some point in the process Scott was roused and they exchanged &quot;hey&quot;s without looking.
<br />

<br />
His work finally complete, Don opened the window behind the plant and a cool morning breeze blew a strong blast of the plant's fragrance at him full in the face.  Don staggered back into the chair, seeing stars in his vision.  He struggled to remain calm as his dick swelled under his clothes.  &quot;Well, I never thought you had much of a green thumb, Laird.&quot; Scott said, unaware of Don's unfolding personal crisis.
<br />

<br />
With effort, Don tore his eyes off the plants and spun in his chair.  Scott was modestly covered again as he leaned up on one arm in bed.  &quot;True,&quot; Don said slowly, wondering if he should wait before introducing Scott to his new best friend.  Why wait, he wondered.  &quot;But this plant is a little special,&quot; Don tried to add mysteriously.
<br />

<br />
Scott guffawed, his deep chuckle echoing in Don's ears.  What Don really wanted to do right now was sit himself down in Scott's lap and plant a big kiss on his roommates unshaven face.  Then he would slowly start to shrink while the big man's hand started to work his -- Don was startled out of his reverie when Scott spoke again.  &quot;Oh yeah?  What is so special about this plant?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Don tried to focus his mind, but it was tough.  Feeling a little woozy, and definitely with some butterflies in his tummy, he decided now was the time to strike.  &quot;I'll show you,&quot; Don said reaching behind to pull off a single juicy leaf.  With great effort he extended it towards his roommate.  His precious leaf!  But there would be more, he reminded himself.  &quot;Chew on this and see for yourself.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Scott regarded his roommates' offer coolly for a moment.  It was true he didn't have classes today, but he never had enjoyed any drug other than alcohol.  Besides, how stoned could you get on a plant that was legal enough for Don to be growing right in their dorm room window?  After several seconds of thought, Scott decided Don wouldn't offer it if there wasn't something good in store, and he did not want to miss out.  Hesitation banished, Scott stuffed the leaf in his mouth and started chewing, tasting its sweet juices as they spilled out and down his throat.  Don and Scott smiled at each other as Scott started to feel -- something.  One thing was for sure, this plant was fast acting.</p>
