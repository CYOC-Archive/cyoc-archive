<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a nice hot shower, Jake walked out of the shower. With a bit of dog insticts kicking in though. He got down on all fours and started rapidy shaking his body in order to get dry. However, his big figure made it so that water dripped absolutely everywhere, all while his fur was still dripping wet. &quot;Maybe ill just stick to a towel.&quot; He said as he got back up on his hind feet. Jake had been thankful he could fit his towel around his waist. He knew he was alone, but even if he had the build of Hercules, he was a bit insecure about his privates.<br />
<br />
After putting his boxers back on, Jake was thinking it was finally time to sleep. There had been so much excitement in just a few hours, and even more to come tomorrow. Before Jake even made it to his bed, the door knob rattled and pushed open. His roommate Leo had showed up. &quot;Oh... uh... hey Leo....&quot; Jake spoke awkwardly. &quot;Hey bud. I know I was out a bit later than usual. Had a date tonight.&quot; Jake was confused. Leo didn&#39;t take notice of his new form? Then it had hit him that reality had shifted so that everyone thought Jake was like this. He sighed in relief. &quot;I wasn&#39;t gone that long. Don&#39;t tell me you were worried.&quot; Jake realised He heard him. &quot;I... I know... it just gets a bit lonely around here easly. You know I used to have Ash keep me company all the time.&quot; Leo gave him a look, and chuckled. &quot;Okay. I get ya. He was the only one who could really relate to you all things considered.&quot; Jake knew what he ment. Leo was referring to Jake&#39;s species. It made him laugh a bit thinking about it. &quot;Anyway, I got some homework to do for animal science. I see your heading for bed?&quot; &#39;He would be the one person to do homework on a Friday night weekend.&#39; Jake thought. Jake just about nodded his head yes, until one more idea popped into his head. &quot;Just about. Gonna browse online a bit.&quot; Jake said grabbing his laptop, heading towards the couch. &quot;Alright. As long as you don&#39;t play any videos too loud.&quot; Leo said opening his book bag.<br />
<br />
Jake booted up his laptop and typed Leo&#39;s name into the program. Jake thought, being the only dog man in the whole campus would get unnerving for him. His instincts yearned for a playmate. He decided to make Leo a hulking dog man as well. This time though, Jake would turn Leo into a beagle. He decided on a brown and white fur pattern and turned his muscles slider up to 65%. Jake thought he&#39;d be a more built for the sake of it. He&#39;d also adjust Leo&#39;s personality to be a bit more doglike, but retain his human traits. Looking at everything entered, Jake clicked change.<br />
<br />
Leo had his book on one side of the table, with a sheet of paper on the other. Focusing on his book, he had noticed this feet were uncomfortable.&quot; Gah! Neede. Why am I still wearing shoes to begin with.&quot; That being said, he took off his shoes and socks to reveal they had stretched already, and were also developing pads under his feet and toes. Jake saw his nails sharpen into claws, turning them into well defined dog paws with human skin. The skin part didn&#39;t Las long as brown fur began to start clumping up from the tips of his toes. Jake could see that Leo was still oblivous to the whole change, and thankfully to him watching it. The fur had climbed up to Leo&#39;s ankles and knees, as they start to increase in size. His knees bent outward much like Jake&#39;s did to support his new hind paws. His legs grew thicker and more defined with muscle as the fur finally reached his pelvic area.<br />
<br />
With Leo&#39;s legs fully changed and covered in fur and muscle, Jake saw what was coming next. Leo&#39;s shorts were beginning to tighten. Jake saw that Leo had started developing a bulge in his crotch area, swelling up with the rest of his waisted. He also saw Leo&#39;s buttocks becoming tighter and more firm, bulging into the size of bowling balls. Above his glutes, his lower back had started developing a bump. The bump extended slowly to about 8 inches, becoming long and flexable. The fur grew to his pelvic area, spreading to his new growth, sprouting brown fur all over with white at the tip, completing his tail. Jake had noticed Leo started wagging it, yet his facial expressions haven&#39;t changed. Maybe his body was adapting to the new growth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, it&#39;s getting hot. Why am I wearing a shirt again?&quot; Leo asked himself as he decided to take his shirt off. He started noticing Leo was also panting hard like a dog. Jake had already saw that after he took his shirt off, Leo&#39;s stomach was reshaping. His abdomen area had divided itself into an 8 pack just like Jake&#39;s. Once the fur spread all over his abs, his chest started expanding, growing to beach ball size again, although not as big as Jake&#39;s. As fur crawled up his chest, Leo&#39;s biceps and forearms started thickening, graduly reshaping into a more tight and firm figure.The fur reached his wrists, as his hands shot out into black claws, and his palms and fingers grew rough pads.<br />
<br />
The fur finally reached Leo&#39;s neck, swelling out to accommodate his new form. Now fur reached his cheeks, and his face started pushing forward, creating a canine muzzle. His nose flattened, and turned rough as his paw pads. Jake hears Leo still panting. While taking breaths in and out, Jake noticed Leo&#39;s tounge was enlongating and flattening, reaching about 3 inches out from his mouth. The fur continued up his face finally reaching his hairline. The last thing was Leo&#39;s ears. They had moved further up his head, but they were getting longer... much longer. His ears had stretched to about 5 inches, all at the same time being covered with fur. With that, Leo was now a bulky beagle.<br />
<br />
Leo had finally managed to stop panting after he cooled down. &quot;Okay... i feel much better.&quot; He said as his tail started wagging in relief. Jake looked at Leo&#39;s new body. His facial features remained mostly the same, not mentioning his muzzle, but he was bulging with muscle everywhere on his body. Leo of course wasn&#39;t as big as Jake, but if the two were to wrestle, he wouldn&#39;t underestimate him. Leo finally turned his gaze away from his book to look at Jake. &quot;Hey. What ya staring at?&quot; The sudden response made Jake back up a bit. &quot;Nothing. Just wanted to ask if you needed help.&quot; Leo raised an eyebrow at his comment. &quot;Thanks... but I&#39;m good. Besides, you look tired. Maybe you should hit the sack.&quot; Leo turned back to his book. Jake felt weird talking to Leo like that. His beagle muzzle moved like human lips. He had decided to take Leo&#39;s advice and just turn in for the day. <br />
<br />
Returning to his bed, which could surprisingly hold his weight well enough, Jake lied down and tried to get some sleep, thinking about Leo&#39;s new appearance, and wondered what tomorrow would bring in store for him.</p>
