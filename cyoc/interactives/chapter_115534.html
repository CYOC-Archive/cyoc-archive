<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;But mom, I don&#39;t want to go to boarding school,&quot; Ben cried as his mother dragged him to the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, you don&#39;t have a choice, I can&#39;t do everything and if your away I can work properly,&quot; Sara responded. &quot;Your sister doesn&#39;t mind,&quot; she lied &quot;so why should you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben&#39;s sister lucie sat quietly in the back of the car, headphones in, trying to ignore everything else. Ben groaned and moaned as he was forced to sit next to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Ben, it won&#39;t be that bad. It&#39;s just for this semester, after that you can go back to your normal school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben said nothing as he stared out of the window. Sara set off and turned the radio on, a que that she wanted the others to be quiet.<br />
<br />
Ben hated the idea of boarding school in general but from what he had heard this one was very bad. It was a Catholic school, run by a group of nuns. And he had to wear a uniform. How could he, a 16 year old boy, survive in such a place. He knew Lucie would be fine, she was boring as ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is she so boring&quot;, he wondered, she was only a year older than him yet acted about twice her age, and looked it. Ben&#39;s mother was a very attractive woman: sun kissed skin, curvaceous figure and goddess like face, which Lucie had inherited in spades, almost the spitting image of her. Ben had not been so lucky, he had seen pictures of his father, he was a big dude. Ben was a short skinny kid who looked about twelve if you asked anyone who didn&#39;t know him.<br />
<br />
Ben tried to get some sleep as he knew they were in for a long drive and also he didn&#39;t like thinking about what the next three months had in store for him. When he awoke a few hours later the navigator on the car said they only had twenty minutes to go. <br />
<br />
He looked around for a while, they were in the middle of nowhere. The school must have gotten everything delivered as there were only fields around. <br />
<br />
They eventually approached a large, castle like building and drove up to the gate where there were a few other cars approaching as well. <br />
<br />
They drove up a long road until they reached the building. The three of them exited the car and were approached by a smiling nun, who walked swiftly up to them, The habit of her gown flowing in the wind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, you must be Sara. I&#39;m sister Abigail, are these two here for the semester?&quot; She asked in almost a synthesized voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, nice to meet you. Yes these two are here just for the semester. This is Ben, and Lucie.&quot; She said as ahe motioned to the two of them. &quot;Do I need to sign anything or, what. I must apologize im not to familar with how things work here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re free to go if you wish, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;d want to say your goodbyes first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh alright then,&quot; Sara responded. She turned to Ben and lucie lucid and pulled them right in a hug. &quot;Now you kids be good, I love the both of you.&quot; She planted a kiss on each of their foreheads and got back into the car, she gave a small wave and drove off.<br />
<br />
Sister Abigail motioned for the two of them to follow her and walked inside. They walked into an office room with two desks and a bunch of file drawers lining the walls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I know you two have only just got  and may not be ready for this but we are going to do a test.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben went to speak up but was struck by a stern gaze from Sister Abigail. <br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t like to put children in classes based on age, but rather based on ability. So if you will, sit down and take this Test. You have as long as you want, just hand it to me and we&#39;ll see what result you get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben sat down and was handed a panflet of paper withowith one hundred and twenty questions on it about a bunch of different subjects. He wrote his name down and started question one. <br />
<br />
The first few questions were easy but got harder and harder as they went on, he was stuck as to what to do by question 15. He looked over at Lucie who looked to be blasting through questions with ease. Ben was frustrated but kept on going, unbeknownst to him however. I&#39;m his frustration he had failed to get even a single answer correct. He handed in his test and sister Abigail looked over it.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could just  wait for your sister to finish please, sit back down.&quot;<br />
<br />
About 10 minutes later Lucie handed in her paper. It was looked over and both of their papers were marked. Sister Abigail took in a breath and read out their scores.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben you scored a total of seven out of 120 and Lucie you scored 103, which is exceptional. Now let&#39;s see where that puts the two of you.&quot; She pulled a manila folder out of a drawer and filed through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;That puts Ben in kindergarten, no; nursery even and lucie you&#39;re actually above the highest grade we teach so your going to go into our special program.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 16, I can&#39;t be in nursery&quot; Ben proclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that child.&quot; Sister Abigail replied coyly. And she snapped the fingers on her gloves hand.</p>
