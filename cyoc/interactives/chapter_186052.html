<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Do you have any money?&quot; – The voice from the door said. Jake looked and saw it was his little brother, Mike. He was a couple years younger than Jake, and had just entered high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot to take my money, and now I can&#39;t buy anything to eat. I saw you leaving class, so I followed. Do you have any?&quot; – Mike continued. Jake, still in shock about his cock, didn&#39;t answer, and was still trying to process everything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I&#39;m hungry. Do you have money or not?&quot; – Asked Mike, coming closer. He suddenly stopped as the smell of Jake&#39;s cock reached his nose. He looked down, not seeing it as Jake was still turned around, but he said – &quot;Boy, that smells really good. Hey, Jake. If you don&#39;t have money, can I eat that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake turned around, and Mike saw Jake&#39;s cock, all brown, sticking out of Jake&#39;s pants. Jake was about to give Mike some money, but then he stopped and, without thinking, his mouth said – &quot;Sure, you can have it.&quot; – Then, while Jake was trying to run, his body took control and went inside one of the stalls, sat on the toilet with his cock still out and told Mike – &quot;Come and get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Mike followed Jake into the stall, closing the door behind him. Jake was trying to regain control of his own body, to tell Mike that he didn&#39;t want to do this, but he couldn&#39;t do anything. Mike got on his knees and took all of Jake&#39;s cock into his mouth, licking and sucking it. Jake began moaning as he was getting a blowjob from his brother. His cock got hard inside Mike&#39;s mouth, and he felt Mike&#39;s tongue licking his tip, where he could feel some drops of precum appearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, this is delicious. I could eat it every day&quot; – said Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you only have to ask&quot; – answered Jake&#39;s mouth, while he was trying to get out of it. He felt as he was getting close to cumming, but he could do nothing to avoid it. He shoot his load inside Mike&#39;s mouth in an amazing orgasm. Then, before Jake could even breathe, he felt his cock... disappear? He looked down and saw that Mike was still pushing his face against Jake&#39;s hips, but this time, it looked like he was chewing.<br />
<br />
He remembered the phone call and the part about cumming. Every time he cummed, his cock would become actual shit and it seemed that had just happened. Mike was eating Jake&#39;s shit-made cock, enjoying it like it was the best thing in the world. Jake couldn&#39;t do anything, and Mike kept eating Jake&#39;s shit cock.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mike finished swallowing Jake&#39;s cock and Jake stayed there, looking at his now empty crotch. What would he do now? He didn&#39;t have a cock anymore, but then he remembered what was coming and looked at Mike in horror. As if he was reading Jake&#39;s mind, he turned around and dropped his trousers and his boxers, revealing his ass. Then, Jake&#39;s body moved towards it, and he placed his mouth against his anus. Jake wanted to run and leave the bathroom, but his body was in control, and he couldn&#39;t do anything now.<br />
<br />
He waited for a second, and then he felt Mike&#39;s anus opening and a long hard turd emerging from it. He tasted it, strong and bitter, but he could only swallow it, as now his body was in control. He began chewing Mike&#39;s monster turd while tears came out of his eyes due to the strong flavour. He couldn&#39;t believe it. He was eating his brother&#39;s shit, and he couldn&#39;t control his own body while he was doing so.<br />
When Mike finished pooping, Jake took the rest of Mike&#39;s shit in his mouth and chew it. Mike turned around and Jake had to finish eating the shit while his brother was looking at him. After that, Mike turned around, pulled up his clothes and opened the door of the stall &quot; Thanks, Jake, I thought I would go without lunch for the day&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome&quot; – said Jake as Mike left the bathroom. He was still on the toilet with his mouth and face dirty with shit and his trousers down, looking at his own crotch where a cock about two inches longer than before was now growing.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real&quot; – thought Jake – &quot;It has to be a nightmare&quot; – but he could perfectly feel his body, taste the shit and knew this was real.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to leave&quot; – was the last thing Jake thought before leaving the toilet after cleaning himself, not even able to look at his own shit-stained reflection.</p>
