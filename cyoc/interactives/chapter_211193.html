<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan was elated when the Victoria&#39;s Secret store opened again in the morning. He could not wait for women to try him out and to perhaps, dare he hope, purchase him. Feeling female digits upon his fabric was very nice, but to be tried on again... The mere thought sent him to a world of pleasures... Alas, if a few women tried him on during the day, none chose him. He was either too tight or too large, even if slightly so. And then he had to wait until he was placed back upon his rack. A precious time during which his future owner could have passed by and missed him. The slowness and crass incompetence of the employees here! Really! As if HE could wait! As if HE could afford to miss out being bought and enjoy embracing the soft, supple breasts of a girl! If he had had a mouth, he would have complained loudly to the manager for sure! But unfortunately, no one chose him to be part of her undergarments. Too bad too, because some girls were not ugly at all. Then again, as time went by, Dan reconsidered his expectations and reluctance to hug and feel the boobs of an overweight girl, even if  her personal hygiene left a lot to be desired. Besides, some chubby girls he had seen in the store had looked charming, rather stylish and even smelling of delicate perfumes. Dan wouldn&#39;t have minded being picked by them. A clean and stylish girl was all he desired. Unfortunately, his one special girl he wanted still was not there. He swore to himself that once he met her, he&#39;d press her breasts delicately and as tenderly as a besotted lover.  <br />
<br />
As the days went by, Dan wondered if that one girl would show up eventually. Each time he was tried on, he was further disappointed as he got rejected. It wasn&#39;t fair. He was such a pretty, soft bra, ready to protect the chest of a woman and one that will faithfully follow his duties of cajoling and supporting his owner&#39;s chest. Over time, Dan felt jealous of the other bras that were bought. Even the panties made him envious. Even if these pieces of cloth would get menstrual blood stains and even cum, along with traces of urine and feces, as well as having to live right next to coarse pubic har, unless their owners had the good taste to pluck, they still had the opportunity to rub against labia and even tickle mischievously the clitoris of girls, arousing them and teasing them playfully and indeed rather innocently. Dan was assaulted by self-doubt. Was he ugly? Defective? Would he have been prettier as a pair of panties? More attractive? He had fine lace and a silken pretty fabric of a nice blue hue, however. Anyone would have called him a pretty bra, he was sure. And... What would happen to him if he wasn&#39;t picked by the time the season fashions ended and another started? Being on the sales racks or boxes was not that bad, if it meant he got bought eventually. But... What if he wasn&#39;t chosen when the sales ended? What then? If Dan had had blood, it would have turned cold. Luckily, it did not have to come to that and Dan later thought that it had been beneficial for him to wait, in spite of his worries.<br />
When he had given up hope, a manicured hand took him from the rack and carried him daintily to the changing room, her heels delicately smacking the floor. Dan was stunned. That girl easily was amongst the prettiest that had tried him since he&#39;d arrived. If not the prettiest. She was tall, almost 1.80 meters and very slim. Why, she had the measurements of Megan Fox, or nearly so. Dan had fantasized on the actress enough to gauge competently a comparison. And she dressed sexy too, with slim jeans and a top showing just enough boobs to stay shy of being vulgar. Obviously she acted like she owned her body, and not like she was a simple mind living in a shell of flesh. The difference between people that looked after their health and hygiene thoroughly and those who just munched on junk food and smoked without a care. Dan had learned to respect and appreciate the first since he&#39;d been a bra. Clearly the sort of people he preferred to be owned by. The girl tried on Dan first, much to his joy. And oh, wow! He fit her superbly. He supported and engulfed her soft breasts firmly yet gently and her skin was as smooth as velvet. Being pressed against these pert little globes of flesh was a true delight! True, her boobs were on the smaller side but that meant less sagging in the long term. Besides, bouncy little apples of breasts were just as enticing as melons. Or even cherries for that matter. As long as the fruits were young, full, ripe with youth and juicy, the size mattered not. Those apples sure were the sin of Dan right now. And their aureolas were just as soft and perky! Dan the bra was so overjoyed that he felt as if he was plunging his face in this girl&#39;s chest and pressing his hands upon her breasts. Feeling her boobs press upon his fabric made him respond by stretching against these two mammary glands. He had to reassure these sinful twins. He promised them he&#39;d protect them, ensure their safety, support them to the very end and that even in bed, he&#39;d hug them like two precious babies and that they would fall asleep safe and sound. Did the owner of these wonderful breasts hear his oaths to her delightful boobs? Impossible to know, yet she did decide to select Dan. Dan thought he looked stunning upon her with only her jeans and shoes in the mirror of the changing room. Why, a sexy picture worthy of the nest movies aimed at guys! Dan glowed with pride, all doubts about himself gone for good. He WAS sexy and cute and worthy of the best girls! He was exclusive all right, hew could only fit the sexy chicks! The girl shook her hair cropped to her shoulders and removed Dan from her frame. The bra was most disappointed but knew it was only temporary. And in the meantime, he could see the rest of her body as she tried on panties. What a small rounded cheeks she had! The perkiest buttocks ever! And she even shaved down there! Really, Dan thought he had picked the winning ticket at the lottery. <br />
Obviously, that girl was on a shopping spree because she purchased four more bras and a dozen panties. As Dan was carefully folded and placed into a pink bag, he was beside himself with glee. Not only he was purchased, but he was bought by a hottie! He felt so special! And as the young woman carried him through the mall, he saw guys glancing at her direction. Dan would have stuck his tongue out at them if he could have. These guys could only fantasize about her. He&#39;d be the one privy to her intimacy and he&#39;d have access to the places those dudes never would! He&#39;d be the one touching her boobs and feeling her warmth all day long! Ha! Those poor saps! He&#39;d be the one seeing her naked every day and becoming extremely intimate with that part of her body that drove guys wild. He was still elated as the young woman went to the food cart and ordered a salad with beetroot, vegetarian sushi and green tea. Oh, Dan thought, she really is the sort of girl to look after herself. He couldn&#39;t wait to spend the rest of his life with her.     <br />
<br />
It turned out this girl was a model, as well as an artist. She drew female nudes and did photo shoots. For Dan, this was the high-life. He got to see Claire everywhere. When she lounged in a bath. When she ate her healthy meals, mostly of greens. When she posed seductively yet demurely during the shoots. When she dressed and undressed. And talk about a girl of wealth and taste! her paintings and drawings sold well and Dan felt very important in his mission of helping her being enticing and good-looking. She had just the right amount of curves upon her slim body and her clothes fit her very well. She was a bit of a loner but Dan did not mind. Like that he had the impression of having her for himself. His little sexy model. She spent a lot of time grooming and buying skincare products, as well as toiletries. Dan did not mind, as he would be the one feeling the softness of her skin. Her breasts were like soft delicate pillows to him, as soft as the satin sheets of her bed. Her little apartment was always spotless. She made sure of it when she cleaned it up and Dan fell utterly at ease with her, wishing he could stay with her forever and revelling in the feel of her body.</p>
