<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You can do it, man! Push...push!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Fuuuck, man!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had decided on the recommendation of Matt Dalton (the high school&#39;s very nice and accommodating JVC Quarterback) to start working out - Matt seemed to find the growth and height Jeff had achieved quite remarkable, and even as Jeff had previously thought Matthew seemed remarkably distant, now the two of them seemed to hang out more.<br />
<br />
So with 24 more days of this accelerated growth, and Jeff&#39;s new acuity in the gym, he found that his body was responding very strongly to the stimulus. His entire build seemed to puff up with muscles, muscles Jeff had never even thought prior to talking to Matt about working out. His core pushed out against his older brother&#39;s clothes, and on his polos the six pack he&#39;d developed almost seemed to be visible thru the shirt!<br />
<br />
His shoulders were broad and powerfully built, forcing students around him to give him the right of way in the halls. Even Brian admitted to Jeff in privacy that he was a little intimidated by how big Jeff was. And Big Jeff seemed to be catching on as a name. He heard it uttered by disbelieving football players and jealous former nerdy compatriots. He heard it spoken by teachers who seemed taken by just how quick this seemed to happen, before ruminating he HAD been interested &quot;for a while&quot; in fitness, as if snapping back in some way.<br />
<br />
As of now, Jeff was of course in the weight room, his wide and strong jaw clenched tight as he powered out a set of military press, the weight bar loaded out with two big 45 lbs plates. 225 was a personal record for him on military press, and he&#39;d found that when he started eating healthier too that his body responded in kind with even quicker growth.<br />
<br />
Racking the weight after 12 reps, Jeff got up and took off his hoodie to flex - and he was almost taken away with how he looked. Two years further development with this ironclad fitness routine had bolstered his muscles to a level he&#39;d only seen in Instagram and Snapchat - of bros snappily posing and exulting in their development.<br />
<br />
He could not let it on that he was actually 20 now, and with this development came a desire to keep this new and respected Jeff present in the school. The new bodybuilder-jock had never been so readily respected, and the feeling made him feel heady with an almost coquettish arrogance.<br />
<br />
Fists crashing together in a bump, he and the primely muscled Matt chuckled and moved on.<br />
<br />
Matt asked, &quot;I swear man, every single time I see you you get bigger...what&#39;s the secret?&quot; Asking about the secret had a certain dark tone to it, as if expecting a very typical answer. Nobody got this big without a certain chemical agent. 235 at &quot;16&quot;? No way! Jeff of course had also had to shave up a lot to maintain his illusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;No secret, man,&quot; Jeff said with ease, &quot;I just come in, I work hard, and I eat right.&quot; Well, that and a magical computer program capable of accelerating my aging. But he didn&#39;t see any reason to mention that little detail.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Sure, man. But I respect your privacy,&quot; Matt said, and lightly jabbed Jeff&#39;s jacked shoulder, &quot;You don&#39;t gotta worry about me. I&#39;m no gossip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt didn&#39;t need to be.<br />
<br />
People around school basically saw Jeff&#39;s steroid use as kind of an open secret even without it being true. Nobody could prove it or catch him in the act, and there was talk of a drug test being administered, but nobody really wanted to make the first move.<br />
<br />
Jeff jumped on bench press to clear his head of any of his doubts. He wasn&#39;t on anything and no amount of tests could change that. He did 275, and found himself grunting and groaning like a true blue bodybuilder. Maybe that could be something he did...well, best leave the Chronivac on then, so he could continue his development. See where it all goes.<br />
<br />
Jeff powered out six sets of ten, leaving an astonished Matt asking if he was all good after such an exhaustive looking series of sets.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m great,&quot; Jeff started, &quot;Barely even my personal record. That&#39;d be...uhh, 305.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three hundred and five!? Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ, man!&quot; Matt smirked and lead the way to the next exercise, which in terms of their full body workout, was due to be lat pulldown. Jeff was really liking how big and strong his lats were looking lately. Really pushing out. His mom called em wings!<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta come to Brady Jescott&#39;s party this coming Saturday. Everybody&#39;s gonna be there!&quot; Matt invited as Jeff went on doing his pulldowns.<br />
<br />
Finishing a 12 rep set, Jeff got up for a moment and pressed a hand into the leg rest, &quot;Seriously? I&#39;m invited? Officially...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah man, definitely. Everybody&#39;s gonna love to have you there. Hot chicks if you&#39;re into them and hot dudes like me if you swing the other way.&quot; Matt said and scoped out how Jeff took it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not personally gay bro...&quot; Jeff grinned as he commenced his set, chatting even as he powered out a set of 10 at a higher weight, &quot;...but...thanks for being inclusive. You can...definitely count me in...mmph there we GO!!&quot; Jeff had a bunch of friends who were gay, and he was glad Matt at least was inclusive in terms of the kinds of available hook ups for the party.<br />
<br />
As the two of them continued the workout, Jeff wondered how much more he&#39;d change between now and the party that weekend...</p>
