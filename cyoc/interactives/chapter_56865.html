<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin looked up and just stared in complete amazement at his little brother, who really wasn’t all that “little” anymore. In fact, Ty was standing seven feet tall, and he weighed over seven-hundred pounds – all muscle- and it showed!<br />
<br />
Seeing Ty standing there, flexing as he looked down at his abs, his chest, and his enormous legs, was just an incredible turn-on for Dustin. He could not believe that he now had the power to take any being, especially a person such as his wimpy little adopted brother, and transform him so easily into such a hulking behemoth of muscle and strength just by wishing it.<br />
<br />
Just the thought of making Ty grow bigger was giving Dustin goose bumps. In fact, it was making him incredibly aroused, knowing that he had the ability to make his younger brother as big as he wanted.<br />
<br />
“Ooooh Ty… Dude… You look… Magnificent… Stupendous… Titanic…” Dustin stuttered, while he just stood there, practically drooling as he gawked at his enormous brother. Indeed, Ty was probably the largest human being on the face of the planet at this point.<br />
<br />
“Dang, Dustin…” Ty grinned, as he slowly turned his small head, which sat on top of his thick, bull-shaped neck. His shoulders were like six feet wide and his delts and his triceps were absolutely astounding. His pectorals were so big, that it had become impossible for Ty to see directly in front of him, just because he had these huge mounds of thick, spherical muscle sticking out in front of his chest. Truly, Ty practically resembled a Greek god! “I don’t think you could make me bigger than this, bro…”<br />
<br />
“Ya wanna bet?” Dustin grinned. “I think I can!”<br />
<br />
Even though it really wasn’t Ty’s intention to challenge Dustin or question Dustin’s powers, Dustin took it that way, and decided in his mind to prove to Ty that he was in charge, as it was his duty to do so, as his older brother. <br />
<br />
“Let me show you what I can do!” Dustin assured Ty.<br />
<br />
“Huh? What? What are you gonna---“ Ty began to wonder, just when he was overcome by that odd, tingling sensation he had just felt a few moments earlier when Dustin had made him grow the first two times.<br />
<br />
“Come on, bro…” Dustin ordered. “Get bigger! BIGGER!”<br />
<br />
“WHOA!” Ty exclaimed, as his huge muscles began to inflate even MORE!<br />
<br />
Ty was in complete ecstasy as his enormous arms began to expand to the size of sewer pipes. His monstrous legs, which were as thick and as wide as steel columns already, now grew thicker, wider, and even longer!<br />
<br />
“Whooooaaa! Take it easy Dustin!!!!” Ty gasped as his body continued to expand in every direction!<br />
<br />
His torso ballooned outward, sideways, and upward while his limbs just grew longer and thicker at the same time. If Ty seemed freakish at first, then he was absolutely monstrous now!<br />
<br />
Ty’s little head was barely visible as it was surrounded by huge mounds of large, round muscle, which just didn’t seem to stop expanding. He could no longer move his arms or his legs, for he had become immobile. His limbs were now far too heavy for him, and everything had become too big. His fingers and his hands were now the size of large metal sheets. His legs were completely inhumane and his torso seemed like a giant wall of flesh and muscle. Ty now towered over everyone at 12 feet tall and over 1,100 pounds!<br />
<br />
“Uuuuhhh… Dustin! STOP! Please STOP!” Ty groaned.<br />
<br />
“Alright…. Alright…” Dustin said, as he silently wished for Ty’s dramatic growth to cease, leaving the boy standing before him like a huge monument of muscle.<br />
<br />
“Dustin! I-I can’t move!” Ty gasped out loud.<br />
<br />
Ty tried desperately to move his arms sideways or upwards, but they were just far too heavy for Ty to lift, even with all that muscle. Then he tried to take a few steps and walk forward, but the poor boy just couldn’t get his huge, massive legs to move at all.<br />
<br />
Dustin noted Ty’s struggle and wondered what to do. He realized that Ty had practically maxed out with muscle, and it dawned on him that his muscles had grown so big, that they were fighting for space on Ty’s body and that the only reason why Ty had grown to become so big and so tall, was to allow for more room on his body for the muscles to expand. So, Dustin realized that Ty couldn’t move because the muscles were just far too close together.<br />
<br />
“Hey! If I make you grow bigger without growing your muscles, then you’ll be able to move again!” Dustin reasoned.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Dustin! How could you make me even bigger than this? I’m already too big!” Ty grumbled.<br />
<br />
“I’ll make you grow without growing your muscles! Here goes!” Dustin smiled. Dustin was beginning to really enjoy making Ty grow, and Ty was beginning to wonder when this was going to end. <br />
<br />
Ty was overcome by that tingling again, and his body began to experience another growth spurt. This time, however, Ty did not feel his muscles grow, only the rest of his body. Ty slowly grow taller and wider, with his muscles suddenly gaining some more room to grow and to move around in.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Guess what?” Ty cheered, as he was suddenly able to move again. “I can move! I feel better now! I can move my hands and my feet and my arms and everything else! Wowwww, This is soooo cool!”<br />
<br />
Dustin just looked up at his brother, who was now almost 13 feet tall. It was just wonderful seeing Ty so big and so happy.<br />
<br />
Ty walked up to Dustin and reached down with his huge, massive hands, placing his giant hands under Dustin’s armpits. Ty then gently lifted Dustin off his feet and into the air.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!” Ty cheered, as he pulled Dustin close to his big body and gave Dustin a big hug.<br />
<br />
Dustin just smiled. Being hugged by the largest boy in the world was such an amazing turn-on already….<br />
<br />
Dustin just looked up at his brother and wondered what he was going to do to him next…</p>
