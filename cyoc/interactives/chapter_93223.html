<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hannah was walking home when she saw a glint in the street. She bent over to pick it up and found it was a ring. She ran it through her fingers a few times and put it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What luck,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
She continued to walk home thinking about how lucky she had been especially considering how bad her life had been recently. Hannah wasn&#39;t a bad person or anything, things just never went her way. She tried hard in school got good grades and had a fairly good body. However she was convinced one of her kids hated her and her husband had died six months ago. However she was hoping that this ring although very small, was a good omen for things to come. <br />
<br />
She got home, greeted her four children, (three and her stepson) and went to get changed out of her clothes. As she was getting changed she noticed that she was developing a small late of fat. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was thin for ever,&quot; she said analysing her back. She suddenly felt a slight tingle in her stomach and turned around quickly. She saw that she was now very thin. She squealed with delight and looked at her hand where the ring was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder,&quot; she said as she felt her now tiny breasts. &quot;I wish my breasts were F cups,&quot; again she felt a slight tingle and watched as her small breasts inflated to a huge size. Almost snapping her bra. She noticed this and naturally wished that all of her clothes would fit her. <br />
<br />
She stopped wishing there wondering if the ring had a limit. So she wished it didn&#39;t. Nothing happened except for a slight tingle she felt in her left ring finger.<br />
<br />
She changed into a pair of jeans and a v-neck sweater and went downstairs for dinner. <br />
<br />
All four kids were already eating so she sat down to join them. In age order there was Jane at four years old, Joe who was 10, Hayley who was 17, and her stepson Sam who was also 17. Sam&#39;s mother had divorced his father after she had found out he was having an affair with Hannah by that time Hayley and sam were both five years old. His father however had received custody over him and Hayley moved in. Twelve years later his father and her ex husband died in a car crash and Hayley received custody over Sam. And enough money in his father&#39;s will to mean she never had to work a day in her life.<br />
<br />
While eating Joe, Jane and Hannah made conversation however Sam and Hayley made no effort to do so. They were both rather unsocial and tended to focus more on their studies than anything else. However due to that they had become rather good friends over the years. <br />
<br />
Sam However was not very helpful towards Hannah. She had always tried to replace his mom, which was something they both knew she could never succeed in doing. She had always wanted a stronger relationship with the boy and now thanks to the ring she could do that. <br />
<br />
Hannah lay awake that night contemplating what to do with Sam. She wasn&#39;t going to use the ring to make him like her then their relationship would be artificial. No instead she was going to punish him when ever he did something wrong and discipline him, thus making them closer in the long run. She knew it sounded crazy but her mother had done the same with her and they were very close.<br />
<br />
The next day Sam came down the stairs, poured himself a cup of coffee and started watching the weather. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you watching the weather for?&quot; Hannah asked him as she fed Jane from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me and Hayley were planning to go to the beach, so I wanted to make sure we could,&quot; he responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay. Well, make sure to where sun block and don&#39;t stay out to long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Half an hour later Hayley came down in her bikini. Hayley wasn&#39;t an ugly girl, she had quite a pretty face in fact. No it was her body that was the problem. It was her body. She had almost no curves. Hannah noticed this and looked down at her own body. It didn&#39;t resemble hers at all. She decided to help her out a bit and made a silent wish that Hayley&#39;s body would became much more curvaceous. In almost a second, Hayley&#39;s breasts ballooned up to a D cup, her hips widened and her ass became much rounder.<br />
<br />
Sam and Hayley set off and spent a nice day at the beach, they met up with some friends and came home at around five. As they were walking through the door the first thing Hannah noticed was Sam&#39;s skin it was burnt red. <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t put any sun block on did you?&quot; Hannah asked him. <br />
<br />
Sam just shook his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come upstairs I have a cream for burns,&quot; she said as she led him up the stairs.<br />
<br />
He lay down on Hannah&#39;s bed as she rubbed the cream into his burnt skin. She told him to go straight to bed and even wished it to make sure he did. When he was asleep she decided to enact her punishment upon him. She was almost certain it would work and since he disobeyed her she had reason to do it.<br />
<br />
When Sam woke up in the morning he got out of bed and looked in the mirror to see...</p>
