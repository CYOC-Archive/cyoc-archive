<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The part of Chad&#39;s mind representing her memories and general attitude was horrified at what was about to happen. However, that part of her was being completely drowned out by a veritable river of new specially tailored hormones, absolutely overwhelming any sense of reason and driving out all thought being with Vinny and making him happy. Even without the extra modifications she and the other new does had been given, she&#39;d have had a hard time resisting. At worst, she felt a little guilty at jumping the gun. He still wasn&#39;t officially champion yet. There was no way though any of these other bucks could ever beat her Vinny though. He was so strong, and powerful... and very very virile. He was definitely the best of the best, and she was lucky to claim him before any of those other does could. He was going to end up king of all the stags, and she was going to be his queen... just like that Lateshia. Somehow, the thought of bearing Vinny&#39;s children excited her even more, pushing her well over the edge of pleasure.<br />
<br />
As they finished, Vinny looked down at her with his usual wry smile. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to find something else to call you now won&#39;t we? How about Cherry, since you&#39;re such a nice little extra on top of my eventual victory?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. Whatever made him happy was enough for her.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tim massages Terry&#39;s shoulders as she sat in his lap. &quot;Research, believe it or not. See, I&#39;m something of a writer and... well it sounds terribly geeky this way, but my next book involves this isolated elven village, and I just figured, vegetarians, non-violent, pointy ears...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you&#39;re not Tim Corwall...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this isn&#39;t the face that goes on the back page, obviously.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry felt rather embarrassed. It wasn&#39;t often one had a chance to meet one of their favorite authors, and instead of letting him know how much she liked his books, she&#39;d just been focused on how much she liked, well, him. &quot;Well... I suppose that&#39;s why your blog hasn&#39;t updated in so long...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Tim replied. &quot;The next time a fan asks why the next sequel is taking so long, I&#39;m just going to have to explain how I simply haven&#39;t been able to get any writing done because I&#39;ve just constantly been having to make love to a beautiful and insatiable rabbit woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that at least was something Terry knew the appropriate response to.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not sir,&quot; the receptionist told Agent Sherman when he asked to be made female again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why the hell not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it was one thing helping you out when you were on official business, and of course we&#39;ll help get you restored to normal if we are able to work up the proper template, but for anything past that and you&#39;re asking us to provide our regular professional services for free. Operating these chambers is far more expensive than most people realize. That&#39;s why we restrict guests to a single form for their entire stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Sherman glowered, reaching for his wallet. He always carried a handy supply of cash, and a number of credit cards... all of which had been ruined in the initial accident. And of course, with no ID and a different voice, he couldn&#39;t very well just get in touch with the bank. He would just have to deal with this until he could get it straightened out. Reaching for his phone he found that it too had been rendered useless by the chamber. What else could go wrong?<br />
<br />
Borrowing a phone, he called his next door neighbor. All he had to do was have her overnight a comb, or a tooth brush, or something like that. He&#39;d have a sample of his regular DNA, and that would be that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Gene? This is Diane Sherman from next door.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Diane? Whose phone are you on? I&#39;ve actually been trying to reach you all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story, but I need you to do me a favor. You still have my spare key, right? I need you to go over to my place and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we have a bad connection, you sound all scratchy or something. About your house though, that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been trying to reach you. First of all, I want you to know your cats are fine, they&#39;re here with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sherman didn&#39;t like where this was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a huge fire last night. Not really sure what the cause was seriously Diane, you were living in a death trap they tell me. Old paper insulation in the walls, space heaters in rooms with shag carpeting... you know this place was built around the same time, I should look into what my walls are filled with...&quot;<br />
<br />
Of all the possible times! &quot;OK thanks for the update but believe it or not this is more important. I need you to head over, and just... if you could find a toothbrush for me, or the hairbrush on my nightstand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A toothbrush? Diane! Your house is gone sweetie! There was a delay at the fire department over something. I had to go over there myself to get your cats out, it&#39;s a miracle they&#39;re OK. Everything else just kinda went up like kindling. I&#39;m telling you, it&#39;s these old buildings! They look nice, but they just didn&#39;t know what they were doing back then. At least we have insurance though, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sherman sighed. &quot;Right... Would you mind taking care of the cats for a while? I have some things I need to get worked out here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. Is this your new number?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I&#39;ll call you when I get that straightened out. Just... bear with me here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Sherman passed the borrowed phone back and returned to the front desk. &quot;So how long would it take to get me back to normal without a DNA sample?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s the only way we can help you out. Company policy is against providing original templates for pure human forms. I think it has something to do with identity theft. We keep profiles for all our guests, but they&#39;re strictly confidential, and when someone decides to keep their new form, we delete the old as part of the exit process.&quot;</p>
