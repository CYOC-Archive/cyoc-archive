<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The barn was dark, but John found it easy to see with his new eyes.  The girl was standing by a large bale of hay next to a pole.  She was fiddling with a lantern resting on the pole.  The lantern suddenly lit.  John hissed, as the bright light temporarily blinded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that,  &quot; said Amy, as she walked behind him and closed the barn door.  &quot;Wow, you turned out even better than I hoped.  Can I see your wings?&quot;<br />
<br />
John hadn&#39;t realized he had wings until now.  He had been so preoccupied with fleeing he didn&#39;t notice the other changes occurring to his body.  But now he felt the wings sticking off his back, and extended them experimentally.  They were large, and resembled bat wings.  His whole body was now large, well over 20 feet from head to tail.  Amy walked around him, carefully inspecting his body.  &quot;Perfect, just perfect. Well, almost perfect, &quot; said Amy as she inspected him.  &quot;I really wish you were a girl dragon.  Boys are so icky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy suddenly slapped her hands over her mouth.  &quot;Oh crap, I just wasted my wish, &quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t understand what she meant.  Then he suddenly felt a stirring in his groin. His penis tingled.  He was a little embarrassed to do it, but he had to see what was going on.  He focused on his dick, and it shot out of its slit.  The long barbed white shaft looked smaller somehow.  As he watched, it rapidly got smaller and thinner.  Try as he might, he couldn&#39;t get it to extend any further out of its slit.  It finally became a small nub and rested just inside his cloacae.  John was suddenly racked by intense pain, as his testicles swelled inside his abdomen, changing into large ovaries. They immediately set to work, shifting sperm into ova.  One sperm rapidly grew into a large egg.  John grunted as it forced its way out of his womb and through his cloacae.  John hissed in shock at the new egg that plopped out of his body onto the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, sorry about that, &quot; said Amy, as she stared in fascination at the egg.  &quot;But a dragon is a dragon.  It really shouldn&#39;t matter if you are a boy or a girl.  I wonder if a baby dragon is in there?  That would be pretty cool.  The hens can only have chicks if they are fertilized by a rooster.  I wonder if that&#39;s true for dragons, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy tapped the egg to see if anything was inside.<br />
<br />
John was fed up.  This had gone on long enough. First he was dragon, and now a female dragon.  This girl seemed to know what was going on, and he wanted some answers. He began to hiss and grunt, trying to communicate with Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, easy girl.  Sorry I can&#39;t understand you.  I really wish that I had used to my wish to be able to communicate with you.  But I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.  I know what you want.  An explanation.  Well, John, I guess I owe you one, &quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
Amy giggled a little.  &quot;I guess I shouldn&#39;t call you John anymore.  That doesn&#39;t sound like a name for a dragon, especially a female one.  How about Jana?  That sounds kind of magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
John huffed angrily.  He didn&#39;t like the name, but there really wasn&#39;t anything  he could say about it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, as I was saying ....&quot; Amy began.  She stopped and suddenly turned her head.  &quot;Did you hear that?  I think someone is outside the door.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked at the barn door. He hadn&#39;t heard anything, but in truth he really wasn&#39;t listening.  He turned and saw Amy approaching him with a leash and collar.  He reared up and backed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Jana.  I know how this looks, but hear me out.  If you let me put this collar on you and pretend to be my pet, they will leave us alone.  When they leave, I will explain everything,&quot; said Amy.<br />
<br />
John snorted, his equivalent of  sigh.   He didn&#39;t exactly trust Amy, but she appeared to be trying to help him.  He decided it wouldn&#39;t hurt to let her put the collar on him.  After all, it certainly couldn&#39;t make things any worse.  He bent his long neck down, and let Amy fasten the collar around it.<br />
<br />
Amy was happy.  Her plan had worked.  It had been surprisingly easy to trick the dragon into letting her place the collar on its neck.  She was beginning to think the transformation had made the boy a little dumber or something.  But then again, all the boys in her class seemed a little dull. She hadn&#39;t really heard anyone outside.  It was just a clever ruse.  So she was pretty surprised when the door really did start to open.<br />
<br />
John reared back as the barn door started to open, pulling the leash out of Amy&#39;s reach.  The collar tingled on his neck, and he decided he didn&#39;t want it on any longer.  He didn&#39;t care who was at the door.  He just wanted to get the collar off and flee somewhere else. He tried to pull it off with his large claws, but it held fast.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, Jana, no,&quot; screamed Amy, desperately trying to grab the leash as John flailed about.  As the door swung open, they both briefly stopped and stared at the new visitor entering the barn.</p>
