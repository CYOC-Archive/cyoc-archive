<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh, actually,” Elizabeth cut in, “I need to borrow him after breakfast to spot me while I work out.”<br />
<br />
“Well, alright,” Martha nodded stuffing a waffle into her mouth, “I’ll just get the twins to help me out then.”<br />
<br />
“Yay! We get to help Mommy!” Marcy cheered.<br />
<br />
“I get to be Mommy’s hero today!” Darcy similarly exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Wait, hold on,” Jason interjected, “She’s still working out?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, every Saturday, remember?” Elizabeth asked around a mouth stuffed with ham steaks. The word “remember” rattled around in his head until, like magic, memories of spotting his humongous sister while she exercised popped into his mind.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” Jason states, “Sorry, bit of a brain fart.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, don’t worry about it,” she waved off with a hammy hand, “It happens. Heck, happens to the rest of us a lot. Sometimes I sit on people by mistake and it takes a while to notice.”<br />
<br />
“Heh, sheesh,” Martin chuckled through a gallon of coffee, “If I had a buck for every time <i>I</i> did that, I could pay off my mortgage.” The guy sounded like John Goodman.<br />
<br />
“Well you two have fun,” Martha said, wiping her greasy and slobbery mouth on her flabby arm absent-mindedly, “Just be back by dinner. I’m holding a family meeting.”<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Jason and Elizabeth reply in unison.<br />
<br />
“We’ll get ready to go after breakfast,” Elizabeth explained as she tipped a plate of bacon into her drooling lips, “If you’re done early you can go change and I’ll catch up later. Don’t leave without me though, dude!”<br />
<br />
Jason nodded as he tried to resume his meal, but “after breakfast” was probably going to be a wait of about an hour, and the horrible symphony of chewing, burping, and farting was starting to get to him. He asked to be excused early and ran into the bathroom to scrub himself at the sink. Just watching his transformed family eat made him feel unclean enough!<br />
<br />
After that he changed out of his clothes and into a loose t-shirt and some basketball shorts, his preferred workout clothes. He also decided it wise to pack a duffel bag with a change of clothes, his phone and wallet, and some towels since he was certain he was gonna wind up drenched in sweat one way or another, and he definitely preferred one way <i>over</i> the other.<br />
<br />
Not long after, Elizabeth came to his room, indicated by some serious thumping footfalls and a knock on his door. “You ready to go in there, dude?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” he called back as he opened the door. He winced for a second the moment he saw his older sister. The only thing that&#39;s changed about her since breakfast is her clothes, from her pajamas to workout gear. It wasn’t altogether a pretty sight. She wore a pair of black yoga pants that looked ready to burst at the seams around her enormous thighs, and did nothing to hide a hideously obvious camel toe between said thighs, or her strained underwear which was visible through the stretched material. Up above she traded out her t-shirt for a bright blue training bra, which was barely able to contain her melon sized tits any better. Her massive gut was still completely exposed, shining with body oil and almost audibly sloshing around with the sound of her breakfast digesting inside. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail and she had an already drenched sweatband around her head.<br />
<br />
“Man, are we in sync or what,” she grinned, showing off her own duffel bag, “Never hurts to leave the house with a change of clothes, especially when you’re working out. I always do.”<br />
<br />
“I... yeah,” Jason nodded, “So what do you wanna do first?”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s a beautiful day out,” Elizabeth said, “so I think we should start with a warmup jog to the park. I wanna beat last week’s record so you need to time me again.” Jason could feel his magic memory remind him that yes, he has done this before, and what her last record was.<br />
<br />
“Gotta,” he nodded, “You want me to run alongside you?”<br />
<br />
“Pfft! As if you could keep up with this sonic meatball!” Elizabeth snorted, “You can just ride between my tits like we usually do.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, we what?” the scrawny boy exclaimed as he was suddenly lifted by his giant sister’s huge mitts and deposited into her sweaty cleavage. It was a tight, squishy fit as the elastic of the bra held him tight against her chest and breasts. His legs hung out from the bottom of her bra, resting against her bloated belly, and his head was right under one of her many chins. He felt like a baby in one of those carrying packs.<br />
<br />
“There you go, all nice and secure,” his sister said, holding a stopwatch up to her brother, “Just hit start when I say go.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Liz, uhh, I don&#39;t know about this,&quot; Jason tried to say. It didn’t feel like he was gonna fall out, but he really was just not comfortable being carried between his teen sister&#39;s tits, especially when they&#39;re this gross.<br />
<br />
“It’ll be fine, dude,” Liz (short for Elizabeth) said dismissively, not really grasping the context of her brother’s concern, “Just like always.” Oblivious to his concerns, she lumbered out of front door. The park was about a mile away, but the sun was beating down pretty hard that day. Jason doubted that his butterball of a sister would be all that fast.<br />
<br />
“Ready with the watch?” she asked her brother. He fumbled with it for a second and readied his thumb over the start button. “Alright then, GO!”<br />
<br />
Jason was sorry he doubted her, as Elizabeth jogged forward at an incredible speed for some as big as her. Her heavy footsteps slammed against the concrete as she went, causing small tremors around her with each impact. Her belly and breasts, and subsequently Jadon, got bounced and thrown around by her body fat jiggling around, adding to the nausea her stench was already causing him. She didn’t even get 100 feet before he could feel her boob sweat soaking through his clothes and dripping down her body. Man was he glad he packed towels. For what it was worth, he was surprised that she wasn’t out of breath by this point, but then again with her huge mouth she could gulp down lots of oxygen.<br />
<br />
It seemed like other people were perfectly fine with her presence as well; she lumbered past neighbors as she went, and they even said hi to her like nothing has changed. They even acknowledged Jason as if it were a normal thing to see a boy being carried in his sister&#39;s bra! How do they even recognize her, let alone not notice she&#39;s become a nine foot tall land whale?!<br />
<br />
“Woo! Made it!” Liz eventually cheered with relief as she cleared the park gate, “What’s my time, Jason?” He looked at the watch, and read out 13 minutes and 5.24 seconds to jog a mile. “Aww hell yeah, that’s 30 seconds faster than last time! Pretty soon I’ll knock it down to 12 minutes!” Her huge hands reached into her bra and grabbed her brother under his arms to hoist him out of her rack. He was absolutely drenched in boob sweat and was jittering and shivering from shock and discomfort. He felt like he swam through a sweaty swamp to get here. “Geez, how’s you get so sweaty when you didn’t run?”<br />
<br />
“Th-this is your sweat, sis,” Jason wheezed as he shakily opened his duffel bag, “You sweat a lot... like a LOT a lot... thank god I packed a towel.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, whoops,” Liz chuckled, “Sorry ‘bout that, man! I forget how sweaty I get sometimes. Now, my legs are all warmed up, so time for some squats. I need you to watch my form for me, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
“O... kay?” Jason replied with trepidation, “How do you want me to do that?” He glanced around the park to make sure no one was watching, and thankfully it was pretty empty this morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason, we do this all the time,” Liz explained with a sigh, “Honestly, it’s like you caught amnesia or something. Now come on, just lay down and push me back up if I&#39;m going too deep, okay?&quot; She began to turn around and face away from her brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, lay down?! Wh-OOF!&quot; Jason didn’t seem to have a choice in whether he’d be laying down as he was knocked to the ground by his sister&#39;s sweaty ass as she backed into him, continuing until she was positioned directly overhead. Her massive form completely blotted out the sun over him, and if he thought her upper regions smelled bad, her under regions were absolutely hell. Her swamp ass was at full potency, reeking of... well, ass, and her cunt was giving off a horrible, sweaty, fishy stank.<br />
<br />
Liz wasted no time getting into her first set, bringing her putrid private parts even closer again and again. Her sweat dripped down on him constantly like a salty drizzle of rain, worsening the stank he coated in. Worst of all, despite the unbearable stench and fear he felt staring at the bobbing mass of ill contained flesh hanging above him, he had the most confused boner ever growing in his pants. He wished that this was as bad as it was gonna get today.</p>
