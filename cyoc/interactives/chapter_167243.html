<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was almost midnight, and one of the houses on Fine Street was being loud again. The exterior of the building looked quite pleasant. A freshly-cut lawn, with a neat stone path leading straight to the front porch. The only thing that looked out of place, was a heavily-worn couch just beside the door. There were many holes in the pillows, and it was covered in unidentifiable stains. Beyond the door was a completely different world. Colourful lights flashed out of every window in the house, and the rhythmic thumping of loud music shook the building. It was clear that Zeta Epsilon Chi was throwing yet another party. It was rare for an evening to go on without one. Most of its members were stars on the Kingshead University football team, and so they’d always feel the need to blow of a little steam. In fact, sororities would travel hundreds of miles just to experience one of the frat’s legendary parties.<br />
<br />
Archie, a boyish teen, cautiously approached the front door. The music grew louder and louder in his ears. He felt his hands shaking, as he clenched them into fists and pounded on the front door. After a few seconds, he thought no one heard him over the noise, and just as he went to knock again, the door swung open.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you again…”<br />
<br />
Zach, the President of Zeta Epsilon Chi, had answered the door. He was a large teenager, no more than 6’6”, and was built like a powerhouse. He was completely naked, his ripped frame on full display, except for a small pillow he held over his crotch. His muscles glistened with sweat, as a wave of the boy’s potent musk flooded Archie’s nose, who almost stumbled backwards at the sheer sight of him. Zach pushed his wet hair back as Archie stared in awe at the figure before him. He thought he had the courage to confront them. He was wrong.<br />
<br />
“You OK?”<br />
“Y-yeah I’m fine. It’s just-“<br />
“We’re not gonna turn it down so you can stop asking.”<br />
“What about the other neighbours? Haven’t they sent a complaint or something?”<br />
“They haven’t, and they won’t.”<br />
“Why not?”<br />
<br />
Zach grinned, before stepping out of the doorway, giving Archie a good look at the main hall of the house. The entire frathouse was there, along with a few sororities. They all lay naked on a massive pile of pillows in the centre of the room. Archie couldn’t believe the orgy before him. The intense heat that radiated from the main hall caused his glasses to fog up, and his forehead to sweat. Some of the guys were even bigger than Zach, including Troy, who towered over everyone at 7ft. Even the loud music couldn’t drown out the euphoric cries of the girls, who watched as the boys made light work of them, their hormonal rage refusing to subside. Their sweaty bodies writhed around, squealing with delight when they felt one of the boys grind their godlike bodies against them. Archie was about to look away, before he noticed Troy slowly move his hulking torso onto what appeared to be a man. Archie’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
It was Mr Baker, Zeta’s other neighbour. A man in his early twenties. His comparatively tiny body was engulfed in Troy’s bulging, dark brown chest, and meaty arms. Archie could hear the man’s screams of pleasure as Troy slowly forced his throbbing member deep inside him. Mr Baker was almost suffocating under the teen’s mountainous pecs. Zach began to rub his boner through the pillow, growing evermore frustrated that he was missing out. He noticed Archie’s dumbfounded expression and side-smiled.<br />
<br />
“If you wanna join in, you can.”<br />
“W-what?”<br />
“You gotta admit, it looks pretty fun. And besides…”<br />
<br />
He inched closer to the boy, until Archie could hear Zach’s deep, low breaths. He whispered into his ear.<br />
<br />
“…you look really cute in those jeans.”<br />
<br />
Archie stood, shocked, as he watched a trail of sweat trickle down Zach’s toned abs, falling behind the pillow. As crazy as it sounded, Archie was tempted by the offer. He hated that he had a huge crush on Zach. He had a crush on pretty much every guy in there. He paused, seeing the buff teen lean in even closer, until their bodies were almost pressed against one another. Their somewhat large difference in height meant that Archie could feel Zach’s steel rod push against his stomach through the pillow. The jock was an overload to the senses. He could feel his own member stir in his jeans. However, Archie jumped back, briskly walking away from the house, and onto the sidewalk. A cool breeze snapped him back into reality. Zach called to him with his remarkably deep voice.<br />
<br />
“If you ever change your mind, you know where to find us.”<br />
<br />
Once Archie heard the door slam shut, he immediately ran towards the house next door. He could feel his heart pound in his chest. He adjusted his crotch as he entered the house next door. Inside, a small group of small guys had gathered in the living room. The room itself looked quite decrepit. Pieces of antique and borderline broken furniture was scattered clumsily around the space. An old grandfather clock stood proudly in the corner, ticking away as the entire group looked at Archie, their eyes filled with hope. Each one of the boys was as skinny and puny as the last. Jamie stood up, compulsively cleaning the blindingly red frame of his glasses.<br />
<br />
“So? What did they say?”<br />
“Surprisingly, it didn’t work.”<br />
<br />
A cacophony of defeated sighs filled the room, as the group shuffled slowly upstairs, leaving Archie and Jamie alone. Jamie scowled.<br />
<br />
“They give up so easily.”<br />
“Well, what else can they do?”<br />
“Something. Anything’s better than nothing. Perhaps we could-“<br />
“For the last time, no. We’re not cutting off their power.”<br />
“Why not?”<br />
“Have you seen them? They’d beat us to death.”<br />
“Ah ha! But we’ve got the brains-“<br />
“Sometimes that doesn’t matter. Sometimes simply being stronger just makes you better.”<br />
“So you just wanna lay down and accept it?”<br />
“Yep. They’re the better frat, and they always will be. Even if they never had a party again.”<br />
“It’s not just about that Arch! Our exams are in a week, and I can barely stay awake during classes! Our futures literally depend on them shutting the hell up!”<br />
“Whatever, I’ll see you in the morning.”<br />
<br />
Archie dragged his feet upstairs, leaving Jamie red with anger. Archie’s room was on the top floor, with a small window looking down onto their noisy neighbours. Kicking his shoes off, he collapsed on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. He could feel his rock-hard cock tent his jeans, but he was too tired to jerk off. He was too tired to even change his clothes. And so, with the rest of his frathouse, he quietly put on a pair of headphones and, blasting some calm music to block out the noise, eventually drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
The sound of the grandfather clock striking midnight echoed throughout the house. The tolls were slow, and gradually grew lower in pitch, as if it was breaking down. Once it announced its final toll, the house returned to its usual silence, however, something odd was happening. Archie tossed in his bed, unaware that the bulge in his crotch was getting bigger. His balls swelled in his jeans, until they were almost twice their original size, pushing the constricting fabric even further out. His cock also grew a few inches, snaking down the leg of his jeans. The sudden boost of testosterone began to coarse in his veins. In the other rooms where the rest of the boys slept, their members also grew, as one boy sub-consciously spread his legs to make room for his enlarged appendage. Their cocks slowly hardened, as they all had the most intense wet dream of their lives. <br />
<br />
It had begun.</p>
