<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were turning out interesting in the middle east, even with the end blood feud <br />
between the three-in-one theologies, Jasmine found a particularly instance that would <br />
have been amusing if it had no been so insulting. A number of Islamic scientists not <br />
wanting the blood feud to end had engineered an innocent man into a faux of a holy beast <br />
mentioned islamic text to have carried Mohammed, intending to use he (now she) as a <br />
figure head. The fools never expected their victim would channel the spirit of the -real- <br />
holy beast or that she would very very displeased that some would try to deceive others <br />
with a false image of her... their punishment was fitting and a proper lesson to them as <br />
well.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yippie!&quot; Kyriel cheered as spiritual creature that had a PH.D in instantaneous gene therapy  <br />
carried the cherub around to help the human soul part of her have a healthy cheerful <br />
childhood. Kyriel new teacher and overseer, Myriel, kept an protective eye on the cherub <br />
which Tabris would never be able to do.<br />
<br />
Myriel sighed, and knew something first had to be done and it would become more <br />
complicated the longer she, or Kyriel, waited. &quot;Kyriel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mam?&quot; Kyriel turned her head and looked at the senior angel.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's about time for you to leave on your first assignment to Charlene's family... there are <br />
some things you take care of before then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your grandparents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel shuddered. 'Right...  Did I really let them slip my mind? Or did I push them out of <br />
my mind? I know I didn't have a choice over the matter... but logically they might still be <br />
here if I wasn't...'<br />
<br />
Myriel snapped at her, &quot;Survivor's guilt IS feeling guilty over something you did not make a <br />
choice in Kyriel... and stop thinking so loud.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyriel started, &quot;Yes mam! I just... I don't want them to hate me. I'm here because Jake <br />
isn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And going through never knowing what because of their son or that they have a <br />
grandchild whose a Messenger is somehow better-?&quot; Myriel materialized in front of Kyriel <br />
and the reluctant holy beast startling both.<br />
<br />
'She really needs to stop doing that.' Kyriel thought, quietly this time. 'Or I'm gonna be the <br />
first cherub to have a heart attack...'<br />
<br />
&quot;As for you.&quot; She pointed at the reluctant holy beast, &quot;You are Kyriel's transport until you <br />
realize in your heart that creating a fake of one of you religious figures to re-instigate a <br />
war was -wrong-!&quot;<br />
<br />
The reluctant islamic holy beast hung his head in shame. His shame doubled by serving <br />
Messengers of the very facet of the faith he sought to re-declare war on. <br />
<br />

<br />
Mr. and Mrs. Springs weren't expecting anyone when there was a knock at the door. When <br />
they opened the door, they were less expecting a girl with dark hair, purple eyes and skin <br />
of a mix heritage. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; The child said and curtsied slightly, &quot;My name is Kyriel Kingdom Springs. I'm your <br />
granddaughter.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two older adults stared in disbelief and shock. Their son had been gone for what felt <br />
like not so much time but as a ocean of fog, clouding their perception of their own child to <br />
where they were obvious of him missing and suddenly fully aware again their son had <br />
vanished off the Earth. the fact this happened a few days before the truth of the world was <br />
finally returned to humanity had left them certain their son's vanish was connected to it <br />
somehow, but that 'how' was a complete mystery to them. <br />
<br />
 96% of the combined employees of psyche hotlines and self proclaimed fortune tellers had <br />
been proven to be absolute frauds by the emergence of and stepping into the light of the <br />
true seers.  Jake Sr. had taken his wife to some of his legitimate soothsayers.  None a <br />
single one could help them. They couldn't locate their son's location, or, (as a reluctant <br />
free of charge service often) his spirit. Anigale wondered if that meant something had -<br />
eaten- his soul.   The soothsayers had said that was simply impossible, souls could not be <br />
destroyed. <br />
<br />
Frustrated, agitated and feeling mocked by the whole thing the couple had finally forsaken <br />
the idea figuring their son had been abducted by aliens or fallen through a hole in time <br />
and space. <br />
<br />
Now they had a strange girl come out of nowhere claiming to be their granddaughter. They <br />
didn't see anyone else around, and their family wasn't particularly rich family, so who <br />
would try to con them? They weren't particularly well known, so who would try to prank <br />
them? <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear you must be mistaken,&quot; Anigale said, &quot;We don't have any grandchildren.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl, Kyriel, sighed, &quot;I'm afraid you do... &quot; The girl removed the red poncho she had <br />
been wearing, and showed a part of small mundane wings. They twitched and moved in a <br />
way animatronics couldn't, and then came that slight glow.  They stared unbelieving.  &quot;I <br />
am Kyriel, cherub and an angel of the nine months, I have..... have a lot to tell you...&quot; She <br />
visibly began shaking, and began to blink away tears. &quot;Grandma.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyriel was glade for her divine aura (which was as much a feeling as a presence and thus <br />
was no cheap lantern trick), it made things go relatively easier. Being the angel grandchild <br />
to atheist grandparents was awkward enough. 'I'll have to ask Sigmund Freud what he <br />
thinks about all this.' Kyriel thought, the fact the great psychologist was dead was beyond <br />
meaningless. <br />
<br />
Kyriel explained it all, the prince of the fennec kitsune, who had been in fact half Huli jing, <br />
chinese kitsune. Of the cheating of the contract, of the kidnapping of men to turn them <br />
into kitsune anthros with the minds of dolls. Of the sisterhood they formed in spite of <br />
themselves. Of Tabris commencing a rescue operation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where were you during all this? Are you saying you're what happened when that bastard <br />
fox prince forced himself on MY son-?!&quot; Her grandfather asked. He didn't think it <br />
impossible given everything that magic foxes aged quickly or something, and that made <br />
more sense than angels to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;No... I come along much later. Sort of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you talk about it like you were there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. These all feel like memories of someone else.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll explain.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Of the chaos that had led to Jake's best friend Tommy, the newest arrival being turned <br />
into Tammy then Queen Tammia, and how Jake, now Janice, found herself almost <br />
assimilated by her own best friend. How almost being turned into a spare body of Tammia <br />
had forced the angel, now Tabra due to the angel's alter shell, to spread it's true wings. <br />
How the shock wave had left Janice and Tabra in the same body.   The fall of Karther, the <br />
rise of Tamthis. The rescue of and fail to recuse multiple numbers of the harem.   Of the <br />
choice Tabra offered them all. Of those who took some choices and those who took <br />
others.  And the arrival of Jasim, angel of the Jihad. And the deadly time limit. Forcing the <br />
four of the former harem to be hard coded for conflict.<br />
 It had given Tabra and Janice no time to prepare, knowing their duel nature would be <br />
used against them, and with no extra shell readily available, had taken the only option they <br />
could. And they had ceased to exist. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tabra and Jake ceased to exist as individuals, they became parts of a whole, as <br />
indistinguishable and indivisible as any two parts of your psyche. Then I awoke, a infant to <br />
the universe but with the life experiences of a human being, a slave, and a Messenger <br />
already in my head... I still wonder why I didn't go crazy. I guess...&quot; She chose her next <br />
word carefully, &quot;Mom figured she and Jake would balance each other out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you're my Little Jake?&quot; Anigale asked trembling with hesitation.<br />
<br />
Kyriel struggled to keep her eyes on the older woman, &quot;No, I'm not. And I'm not Tabra. I'm <br />
myself... I'm so sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... you said that my son got turned into a fox woman... and that... that... 'angel'... got <br />
turned into one too.... is... is that the real you I'm seeing?&quot; Anigale asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;.... Angels don't have a 'real you' in term of a body, we just inhabit what shells we will <br />
when we need to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what did yours look like when you first... born?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A mostly grown woman... it took time for my shell to adjust to my spirit's.... age is the <br />
best way to put it, then again experience might be better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And after that? What did it look like? Is this what you looked like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel only shook her head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you.. show us what you looked like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to?&quot; Kyriel asked now unable to look at them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear.&quot; Anigale asked.<br />
<br />
Kyriel formed glowed and in seconds she was a child with fur, claws, and a humanoid fox <br />
head, and a brush like tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry!&quot; Kyriel repeated and then began to blurb, &quot;You son would still EXIST if not for <br />
me! He and mom gave up -existing- cause they thought I could be more help saving <br />
Tommy! And I ended up being the one who needed help being saved! I'm so sorry!&quot;</p>
