<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rod was bit freaked by the thoughts he was getting about the jockstrap he was wearing. No way could it be Chad.  He managed to squeeze out one more load- a half-load really into it, as he visualized Chad on his knees covered in buckets of cum.  But Chad was his quarterback, his teammate and buddy, even if he was sometimes an asshole that needed to be knocked down a peg.    That&#39;s why he had refused to join some of the other guys in pranking Chad.  He thought it was a mean-spirited tradition to select the most obnoxious graduating athlete after their season was over to prank mercilously for two weeks.  Besides Rod thought Bruno and Brent were way more obnoxious and not as good athletes as Chad.  At least he had the skills to be arrogant about.  Rod peeled Chad off and tossed him in the lost and found bin and headed to his locker.<br />
<br />
Pranking me?  Fuck, is this a prank?  Turn me into a jockstrap?  Wear me, jack off in me- wait, Rod didn&#39;t believe I really was a jockstrap, so he didn&#39;t.  Fuck, this is so hard to understand. If feel so disgusting, I&#39;m drenched in another guy&#39;s cum and sweat in a bin with different guys&#39; discarded sweaty gear, and as far as I know, I&#39;ll be this way forever.<br />
<br />
He lay there cold, damp and humiliated, and the lights went out. Eventually, he fell asleep.  His nightmares were horrible.  He woke in a sweat, he felt like he was covered in slime. He stood up.  He was in the locker room.  He was naked in the lost and found bin, and he reeked of Rod&#39;s cum.  The dawn&#39;s light was sneaking though the windows.  Apparently, when he grew back into a man, Rod&#39;s cum wrapped in him had grown with him. Those maybe 8 ounces of cum were now like 10 gallons- maybe more.  He needed a shower.  At least it was Saturday, and a holiday weekend.  During the week, athletes would sometimes arrive well before dawn.  Chad had his own pass code to enter the locker room before  it was officially open, so if he was caught, no one would think anything of it.  Unless they caught him before he showered.  He climbed out of the bin, and put the sock and jockstrap that had stuck to his sticky body back in the bin.  He headed to the showers.<br />
<br />
Chad stood in the hot streaming water, and put the horrors of yesterday and last night behind him.  It all had to be dream.  But he could still feel himself impossibly wrapped around Rod&#39;s rod as it spewed hot cum into and all over him.  It had to be a nightmare.  It couldn&#39;t be real.  Eventually, the water started to get cold.  Chad turned off the shower.  His fingers and toes had pruned up.  Light was coming through the locker room windows.  He grabbed a couple towels and toweled off.  He would find something to wear in his locker.  <br />
<br />
He opened the locker, and stood on one of the towels.  He reached for his bodyspray, but the aerosol can was different.  Prank?  He wondered.  The plain aluminum spray can had two words stenciled on it: &quot;Jock Spray.&quot;  He frowned, but was curious.  So he aimed the can away and pushed down on the sprayer.  It made a whooshing sound, he stopped and sniffed the air.  He couldn&#39;t smell anything.  Maybe it was a chemical that interacted with the skin, like silver nitrate. He put the index finger of his other hand over the sprayer nozzle, and pushed down gently.  Nothing can out, but his hand was sucked in. It was like some cartoon, his arm narrowed to fit the nozzle, and the thing was still sucking.  He resisted pushing against the can with his other hand and feet, but his elbow soon vanished.  He was sweating in fear and from exertion as he tried to keep from being sucked into the can.  His shoulder seemed to stop it for the moment.  He used his other arm to keep his head from being sucked in right away.  He shouted for help.  Chad stared in horror as his distorted torso, abs, and cock flopped by his face on their way into the can.  His arm failed.  His head was squashed between his own thighs, just before he was completely swallowed by the can.  It dropped to the locker room floor with a clang.  The plain aluminum was now the same blue Chad had become in the field house the day before.<br />
<br />
Chad tried to scream or move, but he was moving.  He seemed to be liquid or gas, nothing human except his memories.  He was in darkness.  He was in the can.  Eventually, he heard  voices.<br />
<br />
The can was picked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were right,&quot; said a male voice oddly distorted by Chad&#39; metal prison, &quot;He used it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now he&#39;ll get used,&quot; said another male voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad, we didn&#39;t get to take turns wearing him when he was jockstrap.  If he really was a jockstrap?&quot;<br />
<br />
The spell worked, but our aim was off.  I got him on video dematerializing in the field house, but he didn&#39;t turn up in your gym bag where he was supposed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I told you, I was sorry, but the guys were rough-housing, and I didn&#39;t know that the bottle of attractant had spilled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, anywhere between your locker and the pool.  I know.  I ran around the locker room, and showers looking for a stray blue jockstrap.  Blue jockstraps everywhere, since the school sells them, but the strays I found in the lost and found bag didn&#39;t turn out to be him.  I even interrupted Rod in a jack off session.  I almost told him who and what I was looking for, but since he didn&#39;t want to participate, I decided not to-&quot; said another male voice.  Rick?  thought Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still don&#39;t get why Chad isn&#39;t still a jockstrap.  We&#39;d planned to wear him all week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple,&quot; explained Rick, &quot;the jockstrap transformation only lasts until Midnight, unless its worn.  Then he would change back the next Midnight.  So as long as one of us was wearing him at Midnight, he would remain a jockstrap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so how does the Eau d&#39;Chad work?  Does he change back at Midnight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Chad&#39;s canned.  Until he&#39;s all sprayed out, he cannot turn back.  So as long as we spray ourselves lightly, he can be our bodyspray for weeks, maybe months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, we agreed two weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just saying.  But since we&#39;re all sharing liberal doses of Eau d&#39;Chad.  I suspect he&#39;ll be used up by Friday&#39;s dance.  The can will turn silver again, and he will begin to sublimate.  Well, he&#39;s an aroma now.  His little aromatic particles will have to collect to change back. And that may take a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you mean he&#39;s just body spray?  I thought he was going to-&quot;</p>
