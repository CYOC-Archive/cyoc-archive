<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark awoke hours later to a door slamming and an overwhelming need to use the bathroom. Looking down, he sleepily wondered why he was wearing a pair of pink panties. Not really paying attention Mark looked at the clock by the bed as he removed the underwear. Seeing the clock read three p.m., he climbed down off the bed, briefly wondered why it was so high, was slightly curious why his shirt was so big and then stumbled to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Outside in the hall, a bedroom door slammed; his brother Jack was home. In the bathroom, he pondered why the toilet was so damn high, figured he was still not fully awake and pulled up his shirt and grasped his penis to pee.<br />
<br />
Only there was nothing down there. What he felt was smooth flat skin. Suddenly Mark was wide awake and everything came back; the German Shepard, the horny black lab and how Mark was now a seven year old little girl. Pulling the shirt off, Mark gazed down at her naked body and then up into the mirror her mother had hung on the back of the door.<br />
<br />
Staring back at Mark was a female copy of her seven year old male self. She had the same colour of hair and eyes, but her hair now had grown past her shoulders. A thought that it would look cute in pigtails or a braid bothered her and then reality brought her back as Mark realized that she really, really need to pee. Sitting down on the toilet, Mark felt his bladder let go and for the first time in his life, he peed like a girl.<br />
<br />
Jumping down off the toilet, Mark then flushed the toilet and dropped the seat and cover back into place. As she was pulling on her shirt, a piece of clothing that now went past her knees and felt nice against her naked skin, someone started knocking at the door.<br />
<br />
Before she could answer, Mark heard Jack hollering, &quot;Who's in there? Nobody is suppose to be in this house, but me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Flinging open the door, Mark looked at her now older brother and demanded, &quot;And how about your brother Mark, whom you tried to permanently turn into bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack could only stare in disbelief at the little girl that greeted him and finally said, &quot;Young lady, I think you have the wrong house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glaring at her brother, Mark then started to bombard Jack with personal and impersonal information that eventually convinced her brother on who she was. It was only when she got to the dog collar and the Amulet of Zulo that Jack finally held up his hand and said, &quot;Alright, alright. I believe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stomping down hard on Jack's foot, Mark hissed at her brother, &quot;That's what you get for trying to turn me into a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I'm sorry!&quot; Jack said, hopping about. &quot;So where's the amulet. You certainly can't remain a little girl. I mean, what do you think mom and dad will say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at her older brother, Mark shrugged and said, &quot;I think it was left at Tommy's place, in Amanda's dog house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, Jack rubbed his temples and said, &quot;I think the next course of action is a visit to Tommy's house. Hopefully he can help get the amulet back. By the way, how did the amulet get into the dog house? Did you take it there? Because if you did, that just shows the irresponsibility Tommy is capable of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Searching her memory, Mark confirmed that she had taken the amulet, but something was bothering her. She knew that she was forgetting something, but what; that information was beyond her grasp for the moment.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jack interrupted her reverie and said, &quot;I think it's best if you come with me. I don't want to know what mom and dad will say when they find my brother is now my younger sister. Are you comfortable wearing that? Or should we find you something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark opened his mouth and was about to ask for a pretty dress and a dolly, but fighting this back with some difficulty she said, &quot;No, it's fine for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is wrong with me? The dog form was easier to control then this.&quot; Mark thought as she followed her brother out the door.<br />
<br />
Minutes later found them outside Tommy's home with Jack ringing the door bell. After a bit a woman in a bathrobe answered and Tommy's transformation came back to Mark. Before she could say anything, Jack asked, &quot;Excuse me miss, but is Tommy home?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman stared at Jack and then said, &quot;Jack, it's me! You got to help me, because I can't find the amulet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack instead responding to new bit of news, asked instead to enter. Tommy showed them in and then closing the door, led both Mark and Jack to her bedroom. Sitting down on the bed and adjusting her bathrobe so nothing was showing, Tommy then proceeded to tell of the events that had happened the previous evening. Afterward, Mark explained what she could remember, which for some reason was growing harder and harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Mark thought. &quot;Am I slowly turning into a little girl? Was there something about my human mind that allowed me to control the dog, but it lacks here because what has changed is my age, sex and gender and not my species?&quot;<br />
<br />
Having no answer, she listened to Jack and Tommy talking and then she remembered something really important. Looking at Tommy, Mark said, &quot;You're stuck like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Tommy asked with a noticeable quiver in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just remembered,&quot; Mark began. &quot;That the amulet won't allow pregnant woman to transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy jumped up and her bathrobe flew open, exposing her B cup sized breast and shaved private region. Not even caring, she wailed to them, &quot;I cant be stuck like this. I'm three months pregnant and eighteen years old! How do you think my parents are going to react to this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you think my parents are going to react when they find Mark is now a little girl?&quot; Jack retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to find the amulet!&quot; Snapped Tommy. &quot;I can't remain like this. I crave odd food, I find you extremely sexy and want you on top of me and inside of me, I'm sick a lot of the time and I keep getting these odd urges. Urges like wanting to name my child, buy clothes for me and my child and for some reason talk to an OBGYN. And the list just goes on from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
What followed next was a row between Jack and Tommy. Mark, tuning this out, wandered out of the room. Roaming through the house, she eventually came to the back door and letting herself out, exited to the back yard. Immediately she was greeted by a hyperactive black lab and spent the next hour playing with him.<br />
<br />
It was during this time that her mind took a slip and when Jack came out and called her Mark, she paid no attention. In truth, she no longer knew who Mark was; her name was Michelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little girl,&quot; Tommy's feminine voice called out to her.<br />
<br />
Turning to the pregnant lady, she giggled and then said, &quot;Silly, you know my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's Mark. Now will you come over here.&quot; Jack responded.<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, she said to him, &quot;Big brother you're being silly. You know my name is.....&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused and the teenager that was part of her former life slipped back and for the life of her she could not remember her old name. The only one was the name that she finally uttered out loud to Jack and Tommy, &quot;Michelle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is getting out of hand.&quot; Jack huffed. &quot;We need to do something and fast. Okay, I got it. Tommy, you search inside and see if the amulet might have wound up back in the house. I'll search outside. Michelle. You play out here with with the dog, but try to stay out of my way. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
All three nodded in agreement and split apart. Jack's search of the yard lasted about half an hour before he called it quits.<br />
<br />
Sighing he called Michelle and looking her in the eye asked, &quot;Is there anything you can remember that might help us? Anything at all that would give us a nudge in the right direction?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking thoughtful for a moment, Michelle finally responded with, &quot;We could try the information I have on the Amulet of Zulo. It's all at home in my room. And maybe when we get home, I can play with my dollies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring her last comment, Jack nodded and dashed into Tommy's home. Michelle followed her brother inward and stopped in the living room and listened to the crying of Tommy.<br />
<br />
Looking up at Michelle and Jack, she cried out, &quot;I can't remember who I used to be. I mean what my name used to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jack asked, worry creeping into his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean,&quot; the pregnant woman wailed. &quot;I remember that I'm fifteen years old and male, but I can't remember what my name is. Every time I try to remember, the only name that come to me is Tammy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cupping her hands over her face, she began to cry even harder. Jack crossed the room and placing his arm around Tammy, tried to comfort her. Finally he cleared his throat and said, &quot;I'm going home to see if I can find, with Michelle, any information that can help us. Like a number to call. If you want, you can come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Tammy said to them, &quot;Let me get dressed first.&quot;<br />
<br />
After another half hour, most of which Tammy spent in the bathroom, they were ready to depart.</p>
