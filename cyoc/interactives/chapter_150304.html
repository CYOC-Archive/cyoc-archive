<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick wasn&#39;t a fan of this trip he was forced to go on; whereas his personality found entertainment from movies and hanging out, this trip was the exact antithesis. He found himself involuntarily in an art museum of all places, and with the pace of the assigned tour, he was bored out of his skull. &#39;Should&#39;ve just stayed home today.&#39; he silently bemoaned, not liking any of the abstract pottery and oil paintings he&#39;s viewed so far. It wasn&#39;t until they got to the statues where things became mildly interesting; all of the nude figures crafted from clay, marble, and other minerals certainly caught his attention. Seeing the giant female forms with exaggerated figures was something he didn&#39;t know he liked, yet found this out immediately.<br />
<br />
It was one of the last statues he was taken to that really got his mind racing. A marble statue, crafted in the 1600s by an italian artist, depicted the god of the underworld, Pluto, trying to have his way with a beautiful goddess named Proserpina. Thankfully, by the looks of things, she was managing to get away. Once the tour group was deciding to move on, Nick stayed behind to ogle the 7.5 ft tall woman made of marble. Somehow, the artist had managed to sculpt the marble to appear as if it was squishy, evident by how Pluto grabbed Proserpina&#39;s ass, squeezing it. A part of Nick also wished to reach out and grope the voluptuous Greek woman, though since the statue was elevated on a pedestal, all he could really reach was her calve and smooth foot. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, she&#39;s just absolutely sexy,&quot; Nick admired. &quot;It&#39;d be amazing if she was real.&quot; Prosperina&#39;s huge G cup breasts, big ass and wide hips, shapely legs, and thick lips that were perfect for oral; all of it was what Nick dreamed in a perfect woman. His grabby hands moved somewhat more sensually, with his desires becoming ever stronger as his blood flowed south. Steadily, his grip of the statue tightened, squeezing harder and harder, relishing from the soft, warm flesh of Proserpina&#39;s leg. &#39;Wait, that&#39;s not right.&#39; he realized. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me!&quot; Nick heard an annoyed woman say, though she had a foreign accent. Frozen in shock, Nick slowly raised his head upwards, locking eyes with a towering female. The woman who&#39;s leg he was sensually grabbing; a woman who was an inanimate marble statue just moments prior. Nick shrieks in fear, letting go of Proserpina&#39;s leg; she takes this chance to grab the 6 ft tall teen to address him at eye level. She frowned at him, obviously not being a fan of his lack of personal space.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe this,&quot; She said, her melodious voice enhanced by her sensual Greek accent. &quot;Forced to be groped by Pluto trapped in marble, and then I find some human doing the same thing?&quot; Nick wasn&#39;t trembling, though noting how strong she must be. In fact, he could only look down her beautifully tanned body. Her huge breasts wobbled from her moving, and he could see down past to her tight pussy, devoid of any hair. Proserpina quickly took notice of Nick ogling her again, and loudly groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, I&#39;ve had it with guys always trying to force themselves on me! It&#39;s time to change things up; I&#39;m forcing myself on you, forever!&quot; Proserpina declared, smooshing Nick face first into her very generous chest. &quot;Wait, what?&quot; He questioned, as Proserpina literally tore his clothes off, to reveal his above average erection. &quot;Typical man.&quot; She added, lowering Nick&#39;s waist to meet up with hers. &quot;Time to give you an eternal punishment.&quot; Using her arms, Proserpina pushed Nick&#39;s erect dick right into her slightly plump cooch. Her genitals having been very lubricated, perhaps being groped for over 400 years made her horny. <br />
<br />
With a loud suction, her pussy desperately gobbled up his shaft, plunging him all the way to the hilt. &quot;Oh god, I&#39;m hitting so deep.&quot; Nick noted, squirming slightly to get some pleasure. Proserpina moaned and pushed him in and out, to provide pleasure for the both of them. Despite being made of marble minutes before, she was now a normal, warm, and very sexy, human woman. And her pussy definitely loved being real for once. The wet walls twisting and turning around Nick&#39;s dick, happy to have forced him to give Proserpina his virginity.<br />
<br />
She then lay Nick on the floor, so she could ride him cowgirl style. &#39;Who would&#39;ve thought the Greeks knew of this.&#39; Nick realized, as the full weight of the Greek goddess crashed down on him with each of her thrusts. Her G cup breasts jiggled fiercely, so Nick took it upon himself to steady them with his hands. Grabbing the warm mammaries, he tweaked her nipples to provide extra pleasure. Moaning loudly at this sensation, Nick was surprised no one had come by to see what was going on. Whether the public sex, or the statue missing a large portion, would be more shocking was unknown to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not forget this is a punishment!&quot; Proserpina demanded, saliva dripping from her mouth due to the pleasure. &quot;As per your punishment, you are going to release your sperm inside my womb!&quot;  This got Nick really curious; she was once a statue, so could Proserpina get pregnant? He didn&#39;t bother to ask her and just enjoyed the ride. The goddess&#39; hips humped Nick faster and faster, longing to feel the warmth of a potential lover fill up her tank.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t much longer until Proserpina got her desire fulfilled, with Nick releasing a huge load right into her lonely womb. She too, climaxed at the same time, covering Nick&#39;s lower body with tons of sex fluids. &quot;Ah, that was amazing....&quot; She sighed, brushing her raven black hair out of her face. Bending down with amazing flexibility, Proserpina locked lips with Nick, probing his mouth with her sweet tongue. Feeling her plump lips against his, made Nick cum a tiny bit more inside.<br />
<br />
Still sheathed, Proserpina sighed, her sweat dripping onto her newfound mate. &quot;Well, that was a successful first round of punishment, but we need to make sure you stay disciplined.&quot; she explained. Proserpina snapped her fingers, causing a series of soft straps to materialize around Nick and her body. The started to tighten and become taught, wrapping themselves around the two, bringing their bodies closer and closer together. In no time, Nick and Proserpina were bound together, stuck in a state of constant coitus. With his head between the goddess&#39; breasts, Nick felt comfortable and at home. The goddess made sure to lock lips with her captive once again before speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;A perfect fit; I had no idea we would be so compatible. And as such, you&#39;re never getting taken out of there.&quot; She smirked, squeezing her pussy muscles for good measure. &quot;However, our outfit is far from complete.&quot; Proserpina snapped her fingers once again, causing a tight wight robe to wrap around both her and Nick in traditional Greek fashion. The thin white fabric was taut against her assets, with her erect nipples poking through the slightly transparent fabric. On her size 9 feet appeared a pair of strappy platform sandals; like something one would find in modern day, that tried to copy ancient female footwear. Lastly, a golden kotinos adorned her head; a crown that a goddess like her deserved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. Now, lead me to your palace of residence, so that I may set up for our life together there.&quot; Proserpina requested, patting Nick&#39;s back, before lightly tapping his ass. She started walking away from her old life; Pluto now alone on his marble pedestal, which Proserpina decided was perfect for him.</p>
