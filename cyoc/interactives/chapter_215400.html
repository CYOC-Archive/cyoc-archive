<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After school, Chad was walking home with his best friend, Kyle. They were talking about tv shows, movies and stuff despite Chad was desperately wanting to tell Kyle about his new powers, but he remembered he had made a promise to his mother to keep his power as secret as possible.<br />
<br />
Kyle knew Chad very well and he&#39;s suspecting he was hiding something from him, so he told him, he would stay at Chad&#39;s home for a few hours to hangout. Chad really liked to idea and they started talking about what they&#39;re going to do.<br />
<br />
At Chad&#39;s home, they immediately noticed that June, Chad&#39;s mother, was there. They ran upstairs to Chad&#39;s room and immediately began to play videogames for several hours until they got bored and went downstairs for something to eat.<br />
<br />
June wasn&#39;t there yet, so they fixed some sandwiches and then stayed at the living room to watch a movie. Kyle was still trying to know what was Chad hiding from him, so he constantly made random questions and talked about several topics like dogs, clothes or trips.<br />
<br />
Chad realized why his friend was doing that, so he decided to play along and answer all his question in the most normal way possible, avoiding to mention anything that could relate him to the fairy world that he had recently discovered.<br />
<br />
When Kyle mentioned something about magic and superpowers, it was really hard to Chad to don&#39;t reveal the truth, so instead he invited Kyle to play some more videogames. Kyle noticed Chad&#39;s weird behavior and despite he was skeptical about super natural stuff, he knew that Chad was hiding something about it.<br />
<br />
They returned to Chad&#39;s room where they started to play a fighting videogame. After several times that Kyle had won over Chad, he felt confident enough to make a deal. He told Chad that if he wins the next battle, Chad would have to tell him his secret.<br />
<br />
Chad hesitated for a moment, tried to tell him he has no secrets, but Kyle didn&#39;t believe it. He felt cornered by his friend, so he reluctantly agreed and started the next match. At first Chad was winning and he felt very confident that he could keep his secret from his friend.<br />
<br />
Kyle had planned that and when Chad confidence was so high, he revealed his true skills and won in an instant. Chad can&#39;t believe it, he had fell in Kyle&#39;s trap and now he was forced to reveal the truth to him.<br />
<br />
He had no idea of how to say it, so he started telling him about the fairy world and magic kingdom of Tir Na Nog, its people and places. At first Kyle thought his friend was just telling him about a new tv show he was watching but Chad seemed very serious about it, so he started to think his friend was getting nuts.<br />
<br />
However, when Chad started talking about him being a fairy and having mystical powers, Kyle can&#39;t avoid laughing and making fun of it. Chad didn&#39;t like Kyle&#39;s reaction so he decided to prove it. Using his hands he created a small wind blast to push Kyle off the bed where he was.<br />
<br />
Kyle didn&#39;t take that very well and he thought Chad just pushed him over. He apologized for making fun of Chad&#39;s story but he said he can&#39;t believe his friend was a fairy, because almost all the fairies he knew from tv shows and movies were very small and girly and Chad didn&#39;t look like that at all.<br />
<br />
Kyle started to think that Chad was making up this story to avoid telling him the truth, so he started to get upset. Chad knew that he needed to give another prove to his friend and he revealed his fairy wings and started to fly around. &quot;It&#39;s not possible that Kyle don&#39;t believe in me after this&quot;, Chad thought and he was right.<br />
<br />
Kyle was open-mouthed watching his friend moving through the air from side to side and dropping sparkling dust all over. Some of that dust fell on Kyle and was absorbed into his skin without him noticing it. Kyle was lightly glowing but it was barely noticeable because by the boys.<br />
<br />
June was arriving home after doing an emergency trip to Tir Na Nog. She felt exhausted because it took her almost all day, but she was finally home. She was a little bit worried about her son, but she knew that Chad can take care of himself for a few hours and there was enough food in the fridge for him.<br />
<br />
June went to her bedroom and changed her clothes to something more comfy. Then she started to look on her phone for a while, that was something from the human world that she liked a lot, because in fairy world, technology was almost non-existent.<br />
<br />
She was very into it when she heard a weird scream from her son&#39;s room. The voice sounded so deep to be her son, but she remembered that he now had the power to alter his age. However, he doesn&#39;t have any reason to scream like that unless something bad was happening.<br />
<br />
June immediately discarded her phone on her bed and ran to Chad&#39;s room to see what was going on. She thought that maybe a monster or an enemy had found them and was attacking Chad, so before she entered she had already made a fire ball in her hands that he could use to defend her son. She opened the door with some magic and entered with fire balls in her hands ready to be shot, however what she found was completely different of what she expected.</p>
