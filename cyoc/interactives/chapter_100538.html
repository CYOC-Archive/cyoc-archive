<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The baby fur infection quickly spread across the country, and in the interest of preventing panic, or at least attempting to save face, the government slowed and edited news reports under &quot;national security&quot; reasons. <br />
<br />
As such few knew of the virus&#39;s existence, and those that did didnt fully understand the full ramifications of it. This was one such group of victims.<br />
<br />
Beta Sigma Tau was a small fraternity, at a small in-state university, but what it lacked in numbers it made up for in spirit. It consisted of about a dozen young men, all focused more on scoring and partying then studying or being good. At present the five most senior members and officers were driving to a cabin to celebrate the end of the year. It was a group tradition, and one that usually resulted in lots of beer, pot, strippers and fights, not than any of them minded. Driving in a large SUV, they consisted of:<br />
<br />
Mark, the driver of the car, and the Frat Treasurer, he was arguably the most responsible of the group but that wasnt saying much. He was tall, fit, and tan, with brown hair and blue eyes, and a swimmer&#39;s build that got looks from all the ladies.<br />
<br />
Travis, or T-Rav, was in the passenger seat and was &quot;secretary&quot; for the fraternity, he was definitely the biggest douche of the group, a tan blonde surfer boy who brefered to use &quot;brah&quot; or &quot;bro&quot; any chance he got. The others would have hated him for being such a stereotype if he wasn&#39;t so much.<br />
<br />
Jose sat in the middle of the back seat, as Vice-president of the Frat he was definitely a popular guy, and the only minority in the frat. His lean latino build was that of a professional soccer player even though his major was pre-law, and his ebony black hair was cut short and spiked.<br />
<br />
Scott, sat to the right of Jose and drank a beer with a grin as the guys joked, he was the Frat President, and though he was a bit bossy, they did think of him as a leader. His body was built more like a quarterback, fitting since he was the QB of the university team as well. His bright green eyes served him well with the ladies, and he was a known flirt.<br />
<br />
Finally Will, with his shaggy brown hair and five o&#39;clock shadow smoked a joint on the left. Though a bit of a stoner, Will was beloved by the group, and as the oldest member, and the only graduating member this trip was largely his last hurrah.<br />
<br />
The trip was long but the guys made the most of it smoking and drinking, save Mark who as the DD was responsible enough not to drive under the influence. It was just after dark, with just a bit of light out, when Mark saw a small figure jump out into the road. &quot;OH SHIT!&quot; Mark yelled slamming on the breaks. &quot;WHat the hell man, what was that?&quot; Jose asked, annoyed. <br />
<br />
Mark caught his breath for a moment before saying &quot;I saw something in the road it looked liek a kid!&quot; &quot;Shit I hope we didnt hit him!&quot; Scott said opening the car door. The rest followed and the five of them surrounded the small figure.At first it did indeed look like a kid, a boy, no older than five or six, but that where it got weird. It wasnt completely a boy it was some kind of Fox boy, a little anthro foxboy in a thick over padded diaper and a squirt gun in his hand.<br />
<br />
 &quot;What the hell?&quot; T-rav said in shock &quot;Brah it looks like some fox kid, the fuck?&quot; The kid stood up and shook himself off. &quot;Owie owie that huwt!&quot; he said in an over the top toddler voice. &quot;W-we are sorry kid we didnt see you, you came out of the fuckin blue!&quot; Scott said trying to explain. <br />
<br />
&quot;ooooo you said naughty word!&quot; the fox said teasingly like a kid. The other guys chuckled as Scot knelt down to the foxes level trying to be the calm one. &quot;sorry buddy... thats right it is a bad word...&quot; the other guys chuckled trying to keep their cool as Scott tried to talk to the strange creature. &quot;...will you accept my apology?&quot;.<br />
<br />
The Fox though for a moment before smiling. Scott relaxed a bit before the fox pulled up the water gun in his pawlike hands and squirted Scott right in the crotch of his jeans soaking it like he had wet himself.  &quot;Dammit!&quot; Scott yelled standing up angrily. The fox giggled and ran away into the nearby wood, singing tauntingly &quot;you sed a bad woowd!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mark and the other lauhed hysterically as Scott wiped at his pants. &quot;Damn freak, what the fuck?!&quot; he said angrily. &quot;HAHA dude you got pranked by a fucking Fox!&quot; Will laughed, the others joining in with various pee jokes. &quot;Better cut down on the beers Scott!&quot; Jose said patting him on the shoulder. <br />
<br />
Scott angrily ignored hte guys wiping at his pants until he heard a strange noise... a crinkle. he touched his pants again noticing htey seemed a bit swollen, and again they made the same noise. &quot;something wrong man?&quot; Mark asked noticing Scott&#39;s concerened face. &quot;it couldn&#39;t be..&quot; Scott muttered as he pulled his pants a bit, revealing his underwear had turned into a diaper, one that was growing thicker by the second.<br />
<br />
The others all began to laugh even harder. &quot;DUDE you wear a diaper bro?!&quot; T-Rav laughed as Scott&#39;s new garment swelled to a ridiculous size before stopping. Scott squeazed the diaper and blushed in shame... what was happening to him...&quot;no man i dont i dont wear nappies!&quot; he said before shaking his head, wheare did the word nappies come from?<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude Nappies?! Seems liek you do wear them bro!&quot; Mark laughed pointing at him. Scott felt strange, fuzzy as they laughed. &quot;No- I don&#39;t I am not a widdle baby!&quot; he panicked starting to sound almost childlike. This just made his friends laugh harder. Scott blushed, but slowly felt a familiar feeling, the feeling of the beer filling his bladder... before he could stop it Scott groaned and the over stuffed diaper began to fill with his urine. <br />
<br />
&quot;d-dude he&#39;s wetting himself! HAHAHAHA&quot; Jose laughed as Scott tried in vain to cover up the growing yellow spot on his diaper.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a rip sounded through the laughter and it all stopped, Scott felt himself starting to shrink as he looked behind himself and saw a tail... A TAIL... he was changing into a diapered baby fur... but what kind?</p>
