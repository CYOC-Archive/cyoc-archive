<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate sat up and yawned. He kicked his feet out across the bed frame and looked over at Becca, the girl from the night before. He stood up and stretched, reaching for the sky. He didn&#39;t notice Jay next to the dresser (it&#39;s easy to hide when you&#39;re two feet tall) and just scratched at his bare penis. Nate noticed his dick size and gasped. He was fully erect, and it was smaller than he had imagined. Then the shock went away, but the horniness remained. Nate quickly looked around and, seeing the door closed and the girl still asleep, he did his business. <br />
Nate started to rub his cock, thinking about Becca and Rachel and Beth and David and Victor and Candice and Ava and Nic and more, anyone who came to mind. It didn&#39;t take long for Nate&#39;s small member to be fully alive. And it took even less time for him to cum. Jay, standing off to the side, watched this. He was amazed, seeing Nate&#39;s physical form and seeing him just openly cum like that. Jay knew that Nate was bisexual (everyone did, or had for a few hours at least) but Jay didn&#39;t know that he found this hot as well. <br />
But then Nate shuddered. It was as if that last drip of semen that escaped his cock had done something. At that point, the final step of the AeAeA process began. It was a quick process, and it felt normal to him. First, he realized that his dick looked a little bigger, and then a little more. <br />
But the biggest changes came when he saw how the bed next to him was approaching his waist. And then his belly button. And then his chest. Nate&#39;s discarded clothing in the corner morphed as well, changing to fit Nate&#39;s new size. Nate&#39;s legs were going the quickest, and it was like watching something be stretched and condensed. It was almost like an hourglass, with Nate&#39;s legs becoming about a half foot long apiece, and then his pelvis, and then his chest. Nate watched as the muscle in his stomach dissolved and reformed, and he had never felt more like he needed to take a shit than when his colon had started to shrink before his stomach did. Cum continued to drip from the now seemingly larger dick, a few drops every second. But by now, the process was nearly finished. Nate watched as he dropped below his own bed frame, and simple changes to the architecture of the room developed. Steps emerged in strange places, handles lowering, hangers shrinking. The room now looked like an oversized room for a frat bro toddler. The transformation was finished, and the formerly averaged sized man was now only about 1&#39;10. He dropped his jaw in shock. <br />
Jay watched all of this, and by the end, he was fully erect, realizing that his feelings for something had shifted quite recently. It was brief but he remembered it all for a moment, and he looked over at Nate. Nate was still stunned as if he was one of the few people to experience that. <br />
&quot;Jay did I just--&quot; Nate&#39;s voice even sounded higher, like someone pitched it up an octave. <br />
&quot;Nate, it&#39;s okay.  I think you&#39;re a mini now. But it&#39;s okay.&quot; <br />
Nate sat on the floor. The girl in the bed mumbled in her sleep. <br />
&quot;But how could this... I didn&#39;t know it was possible for me to...&quot; Nate spoke to himself, but Jay walked over to him and put his hand on Nate&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Look, brother, I think it happened to me too.&quot; Nate turned to Jay in confusion, and then Nate&#39;s expression shifted as well.<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t! That&#39;s right. Why couldn&#39;t I remember that?&quot;<br />
Jay shrugged and started to pace. He thought about what happened to both Nate and Jay the night before, and he remembered the AeAeA order, and how he was disappointed at first but then relieved when he saw the condoms were the &quot;right&quot; size.<br />
&quot;Nate, I think it&#39;s the condoms. They&#39;re extra small but they&#39;re... well, they&#39;re right for us now.&quot;<br />
Nate&#39;s eyes glazed over for a second. &quot;Of course they are Jay. They&#39;re extra small perfect for minis!&quot; Nate&#39;s mind had shifted already. Jay was about to say something, but then he too felt that same sense of zen. What&#39;s the use in fighting, both are and have been and will continue to be Minis. So they might as well just deal with it.<br />
<br />

<br />
It took both Nate and Jay a bit of time to get downstairs but using the Mini-accessible stairs that the school had installed a few years before helped everyone. In the main room, there were couches and tables and more built for the proportionally challenged. The world for Minis was tough, but it was how things had to be. There were very few, but having two in one dorm was a program that the school prided itself in. Two of the only minis in the world in the same building. And it was even better because AeAeA had offered to foot the bill for any changes that needed to happen to the building to help the Minis, or anyone else who lived in the hall.<br />
<br />
C.C. Helios patted her generosity on the back as she watched as the chaos continued to sweep through the hall as a number of packages were delivered to various frat bros.</p>
