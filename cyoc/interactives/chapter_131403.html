<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Before I do anything I kinda want to ask you a few questions.&quot; Kellie nodded as she leaned back slightly taking in the red head girl in front of her. &quot;Go ahead ask away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you say your from an alternate timeline, &quot; Lisa said to which Kellie nodded. &quot;So two questions then. One, how many and Two what have been your favorite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good question,&quot; Kellie said thoughtfully, rubbing her chin. &quot;Well I&#39;ve been going from reality to reality since I was six. Since then, i don&#39;t maybe 30 or 40.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Lisa gaped at this answer, staring in awe at the honey haired girl in front of them. &quot;Wow,&quot; Katie whispered. &quot;What were they like?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie shrugged as she sadly glanced out the window. &quot;Some were okay,&quot; she sighed. &quot;They were pretty similar to here, maybe minus a detail here ot something added there. Like one of them I lived through Obama was never President. Another one I lived through 9/11 never happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie shuddered as she revalled some of the nightmarish realities she had seen. &quot;Others were complete nightmares,&quot; she shivered. &quot;Im talking apocalyptic. One reality saw the Nazis win World War 2. Another one saw a full scale Nuclear war. There was even a reality where zombies existed. Thats just a fraction of some of the things I&#39;ve seen. Trust me it wasn&#39;t fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa and Katie could feel thrmselves becoming slightly nauseous as they tried to picture what horrors Kellie had seen through the years. &quot;Well they cant have been all apocalyptic,&quot; Lisa stated. &quot;So tell me what was your favorite besides the original timeline your were in?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smirked as she looked at Lisa. The timeline she thought of would be perfect for befriending Lisa. &quot;Well there was one,&quot; she said. &quot;And I think Lisa will find it very interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you peaked my interest,&quot; Lisa said excitedly. &quot;So come on tell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled happily as she recalled her and Lisa&#39;s relationship. &quot;Well in this timeline Katie didn&#39;t exist,&quot; she said. &quot;Well why are you so happy then,&quot; Lisa stated frowning. <br />
<br />
&quot;Its a long story,&quot; Kellie laughed. &quot;But in thay reality me and Lisa existed....as sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa and Katies jaws dropped as Kellie began to giggle. &quot;Yeah in one of the realities I lived in Lisa, I was your big sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; Lisa scoffed. Kellie smiled smugly as she looked at the redhead girl. &quot;Oh really,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Then tell me this Lisa. How do I know about your obsession with the Little Mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of kids like that movie,&quot; Lisa stammered, blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;True but how many of them dress like the Little Mermaid for three straight Halloweens and refuse to answer to anything but Ariel when their six years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie giggled as she watched her sister blush. Lisa groaned as she thought back to her Little Mermaid phase. &quot;Okay Im a fan,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;But you could of heard that from anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Kellie mused as she rubbed her chin thoughtfully. &quot;But I also can say that I taught you to fight, I recognize the knee you threw in out fight. I taught you that. I also know that you love having your hair braided.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa unconsciously grasped her long hair as she stared at Kellie. Kellie obviously knew quite a bit Lisa. Judging by the smile on her face the girl obviously had many fond memories of being her sister. Lisa now had the perfect idea of what she would do to Kellie. &quot;Katie,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Can I borrow the ring?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie and Kellie gave Lisa a look of concern asthey turned their gaze between Lisa and the ring. &quot;Im not doing amything stupid okay,&quot; she groaned. &quot;Kellie said I get one shot with the ring so I&#39;m taking it. As soon as I make the wish you can have it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Kellie said. Katie shrugged as she slowly handed the ring to Lisa. Lisa smiled as she placed the ring on her finger, making her wish. &quot;Okay done,&quot; she said happily as she handed the ring back to Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you do,&quot; Kellie asked. Lisa smiled as she now watched Kellie intently. &quot;Just wait for it.&quot; Before Kellie could say anything she felt a tingle wash over her body. As she examined herself closely she noticed her clothing begining to become baggy. Quickly Kellie walked towards the mirror in the bedroom, gasping at her appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your making me younger,&quot; she exclaimed as she shrank to 14. Lisa nodded as she now stood behind Kellie. &quot;Kellie,&quot; Lisa said quietly. &quot;Listen I know we got off on the wrong foot but I can tell just by your expression that you really did care about me when I was your little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie stared up at the teen as she became 12. &quot;So why am I becoming younger then,&quot; she asked, noticing her voice rise in pitch. Lisa grinned as she saw Kellie age backwards. The assets of puberty were quickly being erased from her body. Kellies once prominant breasts had been reduced to softball sized mounds while a generous amount of freckles now dotted her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Lisa said warmly. &quot;You&#39;ve obviously had to be way too mature throughout your whole life. You were the big sister, the protector, the one to save the day. So this afternoon, you get to be MY kid sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie gaped at Lisa as she continued to grow younger. As she examined herself she could see she was only 10 and still growing younger.  The honey haired girl now looked up towards the smilimg red haired teen as she held her overly large jeans in place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; Kellie whispered. &quot;Well,&quot; Lisa stated. &quot;How about you tell me what it was like when we were sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled as she looked her childish appearance over. The girl in the mirror was now only 7 years old. Kellie was forced to hold up her jeans, which were now far too large on her skinny body. Wiggling her toes Kellie found her shies to br quite cavernous while her shirt hung on her like a sack. &quot;Okay,&quot; she chirped. &quot;I just wish you guys knew how to chamge my clothes with my age.&quot;Lisa clapped her hands happily as she now sat behind Kellie. &quot;Maybe next time,&quot; she laughed. &quot;For now though, since you used to braid my hair, today I&#39;m braiding yours. Katie hates it when I try to do anything with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krllie giggled as she now sat down in front of Lisa. The little girl talked in an animated fashion while the teen happily did her hair. For Kellie it proved to be a memory, she realized, she would cherish forever.</p>
