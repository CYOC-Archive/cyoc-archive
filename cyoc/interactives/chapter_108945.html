<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Psh. <i>Baby</i>.&quot; Marco scoffed at James as his freshly regressed and spanked father looked pleadingly up at him with big brown eyes from which tears still freely flowed. The disgust was palpable on the new adult&#39;s face as he nodded at Jacob and Rick, who continued to nurse on their thumbs in a desperate bid for comfort that wouldn&#39;t come. &quot;That must be why you like those stupid toddlers so much. Why you like them better than <i>me</i>. &#39;Cause inside you&#39;re just a dumb little baby too. Well - I think we should make you just like them on the outside, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco picked the Chronivac back up - and though the trio of regressed adults cried and wailed for mercy, there was nothing they could do to keep him from finishing the job. After a moment&#39;s fiddling Marco donned a sinister smirk and jammed his finger on the button, James&#39; pitiful sobbing turning into a helpless squeal as he was once more overcome by the regressive force of the Chronivac. Jacob and Rick watched through their tears as James&#39; limbs contracted and swelled with baby fat, as his tummy rounded and his cheeks plumped, as he grew every bit as pudgy and tiny and adorable as they were. Defeated, James could do nothing but fall on his still-stinging rump and fill the room with his piercing cries, waving his hands and drumming his heels as he threw a tantrum befitting the toddler he&#39;d become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude.&quot; A little smile tugged at Paul&#39;s lips as he gave Marco a nudge. &quot;You just turned your dad into a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Marco&#39;s grin split his cheeks. &quot;And you know what babies need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco plucked his wailing two-year-old father off of the carpet and carried him down the hall, condescendingly bouncing the baby and cooing to him as Paul strode right behind, holding Rick under one arm and Jacob under the other. He let the toddlers dangle in that position as he followed Marco into the nursery, a cheerful room of baby blue filled to the brim with toys and games and stuffed animals - a room in which Jacob and Rick would, on a more cheerful night, be enjoying a night of innocent fun. <br />
<br />
James&#39; wails had subsided to pitiful little whimpers but rose right back up to full-on squalling when he realized what Marco had in store for him - when his grown son laid his tiny, chubby body out on the nursery&#39;s fully-stocked changing table. Those cries, however, were suddenly silenced when Marco jammed a pacifier into his wailing mouth, James&#39; mortification finding new depths to plumb when he instinctively wrapped his lips around it and started sucking away. His round, tear-streaked cheeks pumped as the mollifying bit of plastic rapidly bobbed, the baby reduced to sniffling and squirming as Marco pulled a super-thick nighttime diaper beneath his dad&#39;s glowing tushie. <br />
<br />
Marco, for his part, wore a triumphant smile through the entire process, beaming right down at James as he powdered his most sensitive and private areas and gently rubbed the sweet-smelling dust into the baby&#39;s smooth and soft skin. Though James thought that his humiliation could not be driven any deeper, that notion was dashed when he realized that his son&#39;s - <i>his son&#39;s!</i> - tender touch was actually working to calm him, that there was something instinctively soothing about Marco&#39;s big, warm hands handling his little baby body so carefully. All that, however, came to an end when James sensed his blood rush to a very particular spot, feeling as though he might start bawling all over again when he popped a tiny baby stiffy.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Marco chuckled as he gave the rubbery little rod a flick with his index finger. &quot;I <i>knew</i> you wanted to be like this. Now you can wet your diaper and play with your weenie just like your dumb little baby friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco brought up the front of the adorably puffy and crinkly garment, wrapping his father into the first diaper he&#39;d worn in thirty years and burying James&#39; infantile erection in a cloud of padding. The baby laid there and felt his thighs spread by its ridiculous thickness, barely having a moment to wallow in his helplessness before he was picked back up and carried to the crib against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair that your friends get jammies and you don&#39;t, do you?&quot; Marco smirked as he lay James&#39; poofy bottom on the crib&#39;s mattress. He turned to Paul and nodded him over, and a few seconds later Jacob and Rick were similarly deposited in the babyish sleeping space, not even given time to get their bearings before the new adults relieved them of their jammies. The three toddlers huddled together and cowered beneath Marco and Paul at they chuckled down at the trio, chuckled down at the former adults who sat in their crib in nothing but their double-thick Pampers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now the three of you be good little babies,&quot; Marco grinned as he booped his dad&#39;s button nose. &quot;Me and Paul are gonna have some <i>real</i> fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that they departed, excitedly talking about the possibilities of the Chronivac like the seven-year-olds they actually were. On their way out they turned off the light and shut the door, leaving the distraught babies with nothing but the glow of a nightlight to fend off the scary dark. Jacob&#39;s head spun as he looked blankly at the two other toddlers who had been squeezed into the crib with him. Rick, though obviously quite shaken himself, was still doing his best to comfort James - who continued to suck on his pacifier while looking down at and absently poking the front of his Pampers, the frown that curled around the suckled bit of rubber indicating that the newest adult-turned-toddler was still coming to terms with the fact that he&#39;d just been diapered by his own son. Jacob&#39;s fear and anger and anguish swam in the deep well of guilt that came from the realization that this was all his fault. He had to try and get things back to normal - but, he realized with a grimace, he might not be able to do so without his fellow victims being aware of the truth.</p>
