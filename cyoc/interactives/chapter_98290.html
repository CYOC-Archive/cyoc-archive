<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob&#39;s alarm went off at 6 am. He hit the snooze for another 5 minutes. It was Monday and he felt it, the need to sleep until noon. His little brother was already in the bathroom they shared between their two bedrooms. Jacob was half asleep when he stood over the toilet and pushed his clit to point down into the bowl.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s younger brother, Alex, groaned, &quot;I have to stay at school an extra hour today. I have auditions today for the volleyball team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob said, &quot;Audition for volleyball?,&quot; to Alex<br />
<br />
Alex grumbled, &quot;Yea, it sucks. We have to put on these skimpy outfits and parade around on the court like a pagent, then we have agility drills. Coach said we had to wear them Monday all day at school before the auditions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob said to himself, &quot;I wish I knew what that was about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he realized the volleyball he knew was not the volleyball he now knew. Jacob then said, &quot;I wish I knew all of the differences in this reality from my previous ones.&quot; Jacob leaned forward on the bathroom sink and starred into the mirror allowing his mind to wrap around the reality changes that just a few small statements made. &quot;I have to be more specific&quot; he told himself.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Alex switched places and both got ready. At breakfast, Alex was wearing his audition uniform, a shiny blue spandex boy short and a long sleeved halter top that vacuum formed to his upper chest and arms.<br />
<br />
So this is gender equality. Seems that humans have a more blurred gender identity, since the manliest looking man can be pregnant. The body changed made to Jacob and Cary were not limited to the two of them, the reality wish affected the entire human history. Still, with the changes, Jacob and Cary are just as normal as everyone else. It seems that all sports serve the purpose in society of displaying sexual desire and combat. Alex had been working out for months to get the right body shape for the volleyball team, a toned upper chest and ripped arms, along with a flat abdomen and a toned butt. Even a hint of definition in his ab muscles would disqualify him. Sports was looks before function, since teams were scored on their looks as well as their play on the court.<br />
<br />
Jacob dropped Alex of at the middle school, where he saw others in the same outfit Alex wore. Then Jacob drove to the high school where Cary was waiting for him in the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what&#39;s going on here?,&quot; demanded a very confused and slighty scared Cary. Cary was wearing a shiny rubberized long sleeved leotard. &quot;My dad picked out what I wore this morning. He has never told me what to wear before. And let me tell you about last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob cut Cary off, and said, &quot;I wish Cary knew about the differences in this reality and accepted the new reality as normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cary smiled, &quot;Thanks, I feel better talking with you about that.&quot; Cary stared at Jacob for a moment, &quot;Dude, you did all this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, &quot;Yes, but it was not my intention&quot;<br />
<br />
Cary smiled, &quot;No harm done dude. My back seat is empty. Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob follows Cary, and now that Jacob has made Cary aware of his sexual dominance, Jacob thinks about stopping it, but is turned on and is looking forward to having Cary&#39;s cock deep inside again.<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s first class was boring. Math had not changed, and Jacob was still a math wiz. Jacob did more people watching than anything else. The math teacher was still the same boring man he was before, except wore a puffy pirate shirt and dress pants with sandals. So that&#39;s the definition of stuck up in this world.<br />
<br />
Cary found Jacob between classes, &quot;quick, follow me&quot; and they went into the bathroom. Jacob would later notice that bathrooms are for everyone now. Cary pulled Jacob into a large stall and pushed Jacob&#39;s face down to his cock. Jacob was already an expert at oral sex from a previous wish, but did not realize it until he was looking at the shiny bulge of Cary&#39;s cock through his leotard. Cary commanded, &quot;Hurry up dude.&quot; The bell range for the start of class when Jacob was still milking Cary&#39;s orgasm and sperm from his spasming cock. Cary did not fight Jacob to stop, and remained wrapped up in orgasm until Jacob was satisfied. Cary and Jacob cleaned up at the sink before heading off to separate classes.<br />
<br />
Biology was next. Sperm still fertilized eggs here. It was just who had sperm and eggs and how they got delivered was the difference. Mammals evolved with a blurred gender line. Jacob was so fixated on thumbing through his textbook for more details he did not notice the teacher stop the lesson and stand next to Jacob&#39;s desk. The teacher, a stout 5 foot tall muscular man with two nearly perfect breasts encased in a red/white/green striped latex suit, was staring down at Jacob.<br />
<br />
Jacob looked around and then slightly down at the teacher&#39;s protuding breasts, which were almost eye level with a sitting Jacob. <br />
<br />
The teacher requested firmly, &quot;When I am talking I require your attention, at the very least you can just fixate on my chest. Your hormones should allow that basic function.&quot; The teacher then walked away with several students smiling and stifling chuckles at Jacob being called out for not paying attention. Jacob was already remembing the affects of the biology change on world history as he knew it, and has it now was.<br />
<br />
Jacob briefly thought about making his knowledge of the other world be forgotten, but he held on. Things were a lot different here. There was no nuclear power, no nuclear weapons, no cell phones, and no internet. The school still had tube based color tvs. Sports was king here. Some things were the same. Smart kids were still excuded from the cool kids. The kids who used to be the biggest bullies and tough kids were now as normal as everyone else. There was no space race, no satellites in orbit. The textbook&#39;s only had eight planets who all had different names.  Fetishism and blurred sex roles had an incredible change on history.<br />
<br />
Human&#39;s can lactate as early as 9, and by 12 most are feeding others. Jacob drained both of Cary&#39;s breasts and Cock for a complete lunch meal. The cafeteria was the smell of bleach and sex. Jacob helped Cary insert a medium cucumber and an eggplant into his ass. During lunch was a time for even nerds and jocks to serve each other. Jacob and those with the hunger for cock felt it was their duty to make sure that no cock went untouched and those who hungered for breasts would leave no breast unmilked. It has just evolved this way.<br />
<br />
After lunch, there was a siesta time, for 45 minutes. Cary slept with Jacob wrapped in his arms. The bell woke up those who were sleeping and everyone began to head to their next class. Jacob was lost in thought throughout his afternoon classes. After school, Cary found Jacob, and they went to the back seat of Cary&#39;s car. Jacob was still flicking his swollen clit as he left an exhaused and sleeping Cary alone in the back seat.<br />
<br />
Alex was already working through different volleyball positions with the other recruits when Jacob walked into the middle school gym. Alex had survived the body shape round and was showing his skills at the net. After Alex rotated through all of the positions twice he had a seat on the recruit bench. The ones who failed the body shape test were sitting on the bench as well, naked, since they were not deemed fit to wear the uniform. Alex had made the team.<br />
<br />
After the new team members were announced, Jacob left the gym. He was suprised to see Alex come out of the locker room wearing his uniform smiling with pride, &quot;I get to wear my uniform all the time at school. They gave me eleven more to wear. I am on the volleyball team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Volleyball was the big sport here. Football and rugby had never developed here, and neither did soccer or basketball. There were no contact sports. All the way home, Alex was a non-stop talker about how his day and dishing out all of the gossip on the body shape round. Jacob felt a pleasant tingle in his ass the entire drive home.</p>
