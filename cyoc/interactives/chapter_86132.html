<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I walked up to the desk of the chef and took a long good look at her.<br />
The magic of the ring still kept people from noticing me so she didn&#39;t mind me. She went on to sit back and started eating some candy.<br />
She was an immensely overweight Latina woman with bad skin and mean looking beady eyes. She noisily focused her entire attention on the chocolate bar she was stuffing in her face.<br />
Her skin looked spotty and diseased and she had a very short pixy cut of greying hair. If pressed to find a compliment to say I guess I could mention her teeth, wich where pristine and pearly white.<br />
Despite her width she was a very short woman, she wasn&#39;t standing up right but I could sort of see she couldn&#39;t have been taller than 5 feet. Probably shorter.<br />
<br />
The name plate in front of her said: &quot;ms Shrew&quot;. It didn&#39;t say her first name so I picked up some papers from the desk to see if they were addressed from her.<br />
At that point I wasn&#39;t sure if it was even the magic keeping her from noticing me, she wasn&#39;t doing anything with the paperwork, she didn&#39;t seem able to focus on anything related to work at all.<br />
I was holding a memo adressed to Shrew personally, she seemed to be called &quot;Veronica&quot;, Veronica Shrew. The subject matter seemed to be all the people she had fired.<br />
I folded a bit trough the papers, figuring that I couldn&#39;t become more guilty of snooping than I already was.<br />
There were some reports on the people mentioned in the memo, the complaints Shrew had had about them and why she had fired them.<br />
Most complaints came down to &quot;insubordination&quot; or other vague terms. They gave me an impression of Shrew as a very unreasonable woman. One complaint was just &quot;looked at me funny&quot;.<br />
<br />
I wondered how such a woman could ever have gotten in a position of power. It looked like she might have just nagged her way to the top, she was certainly old enough to have been<br />
complaining to some superior for decades until he promoted her just to get rid of her, and she had the personality for it. <br />
Well no more. Up till now I had been using my ring for personal gain and petty revenge but it had become time to acknowledge that with great power comes great responsibility.<br />
I took it upon myself to rid the world of this evil.<br />
<br />
I took away Shrew&#39;s power. With a half a sentence and some wishing magic Shrew&#39;s high ranking uniform shifted into a slightly different color, the slightly darker blue apparently indicated an intern status.<br />
Shrew almost spit out her chocolate: &quot;hhmpf mwhat the hwell&quot; she puffed with her mouth full. She had noticed. Even the name plate on the desk now said &quot;Dr Blutz&quot;. I had retroactively changed reality.<br />
I turned back the clock on her body, an intern coming straight from high school wouldn&#39;t be in her fifties. The wrinkles an lines on her face disappeared and her hair lost it&#39;s grey tint, reverting back to it&#39;s natural raven black color.<br />
Her girth seemed to shrink a whole lot too, all those years of living an unhealthy lifestyle had just gotten erased and they left a way to wide uniform behind. She was still fat, but no longer dangerously obese.<br />
Shrew jumped up panicking at the unexplainable changes made to her body. Her shirt tented around her and reached down halfway down her thighs, wich was good, because her pants simply fell on the ground, she had shrunk out of them.<br />
Her complexion had improved a little bit too, but not much.<br />
<br />
Next I went on to improve her looks, I really hadn&#39;t liked the comments she had made about Staci, this, coupled with my ambitions to make the world better not worse, culminated into a plan to make her what she derided.<br />
I made her skinnier and more curvy at the same time, taking away fat from the stomach and face and putting it in her breasts, ass and thighs. To really see what I had done, admire my handiwork, I wished for her uniform to be properly sized.<br />
Her Shirt clamped down on her, squashing her breasts flat against her body, they must have been F-cups, almost as big as Blutz. Her pants where still on the floor so her white colored underwear, snugly hugging her ass-cheeks, was showing.<br />
&quot;omigod omigod omigod&quot; Shrew mumbled as she grabbed her newly shrunk pants around her angles and started pulling it up, trying to get it past her disproportionally wide thigh-flesh. Ir reminded me of the &#39;dressed like a prostitute&#39; part so I<br />
wished for female uniforms to have extremely short pants and stomach showing tops. When Shrew managed to get the pants up to her waist most of the legs had disappeared and the piece of clothing didn&#39;t have enough fabric to cover the<br />
entirety of her butt, leaving the lower part exposed to the air. Her top couldn&#39;t cover all of her chest either, showing some underboob.<br />
<br />
The beautification wasn&#39;t complete. Next I changed her complexion, going from a spotty mess to a smooth silky skin with like white milk tinted with a hint of coffee. The collection of fat on her ass became properly shaped, it became round and<br />
firm, a proper Latina booty. The female uniform pants disappeared a bit further in between the ass-cheeks. Veronica tried to turn around to see what was happening but she just spun around in circles.<br />
I made her eyes bigger and brighter, bringing forth the auburn brown in her eyes and changed her face overall into a more feminine shape. Her lips became luscious and full, extremely so, crafted into the perfect tools for oral sex.<br />
And her hair grew to be long and curly, down to her shoulders.<br />
<br />
I decided that as far as the world was concerned this was the new reality. Only Blutz and Shrew would remember she used to be different but they would be unable to discuss or acknowledge it.<br />
I wondered what the newly minted sexy intern would do.</p>
