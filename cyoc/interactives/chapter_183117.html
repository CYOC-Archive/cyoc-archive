<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice was a special case, she had seem time and time again how some women would find loopholes in how society sees mothers who don&#39;t want their babies, escape and leave their children all alone, abandoning them, for Alice to find.<br />
<br />
She hated how theis women could do this, to Alice babies were her everything, her hope, her joy, and being a mother was who she was met to be, especially to those babies who are left without a mother.<br />
<br />
But if Alice was being honest with herself, that wasn&#39;t the only reason she enjoyed taking babies back into her womb, she enjoyed the feeling of fullness, the feeling of her babies moving and stretching against her wombs walls, it gave her a sense of plesure unlike any other, sometimes she debated weather it was better than sex.<br />
<br />
All these thoughts were rushing through her mind as she edged towards the door, the sobbing getting louder as she drew closer, then she could make out a woman&#39;s voice, her voice sounded horse, and sad, full of regret.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry kids, but I can&#39;t afford to lose my social status, it&#39;s nothing personal, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be OK...I hope you&#39;ll forgive me&quot; she said as a woman with a black hoodie pulled up covering her face and head came flying out of the room and darted around the corner.<br />
<br />
Alice immediately knew what had just happened, as she came around the door, she could see a hospital crib with three newborns all sound asleep within, their mother had just abandoned them.<br />
<br />
Alice gave a sad sigh as she walked over to the crib, placing one hand over her small swell, and the other on the rim of the crib, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry sweethearts, looks like il be taking care of you now, yet some small part of me knows that I shouldn&#39;t be the one to rase you, that should have been your mommy&#39;s job&quot; she said before giving a sigh and pulled out her phone and began to dial the front desks number &quot;well it looked like il be your mommy in a few minutes, I think you&#39;ll like your sibling who&#39;s already in me&quot; she said with a giggle as the phone rang.<br />
<br />
Finally someone picked up &quot;capital city hospital, this is Linda speaking, how can I help you&quot; said Linda into the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Linda, it&#39;s Alice, we&#39;ve got another abandoning in maternity room seven, triplets as well&quot; said Alice with a sad sniff as she wiped her eyes. &quot;Oh Alice I&#39;m so sorry, il send your assistance up to you now, would you like me to pull up a record of who was in that room?&quot; Asked Linda, Alice just shook her head &quot;no, there&#39;s no point, I mean whoever she was seemed upset about doing this, but apparently her social status is more important than her kids, sorry but I won&#39;t let her come anywhere near theis kids again, they have been abandoned once, I won&#39;t have them go through it again&quot; said Alice determinedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok there miss Amazon, your help is on the way, so il take the liberty in checking you out early&quot; said Linda, Alice smiled &quot;thanks Linda, il see you at home, love you&quot; she said as she hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
Alice sat on the edge of the bed, gently rocking the crib while she rubbed her thumb over her small belly, then came a knock on the door, &quot;it&#39;s open, come in quiet guys&quot; whispered Alice as two people steped in.<br />
<br />
The first was Lina, she had long puffy red hair, that curled and flew out ar random, not in a scruffy way, but more like she had just walked in through a storm, she had a light dash of freckles across her cheeks, and a pair of chocolate brown eyes, she wore no top, her breasts and midsection hanging free, her skin was pale white and incredibly smooth and soft, her breast were like two basket balls, with exactly the same shape, perfectly round, not a vein in sight, her nipples pink and perky, then there was her belly.<br />
<br />
Like Alice, Lina was now also sporting a small bulge nestled in her hips, however she was slightly larger than Alice, her bulge being more pronounced, but she always insisted she was also three months along, leading Alice to suspect she was carrying multiples, and just waiting for people to put two and two together before she would tell then, Linas hips were wide, not as wide as Alice&#39;s, but they could definitely put her own hips to the test, being perfectly suited for bearing children, her ass was cut yet bouncy, nowhere near as big as Alice&#39;s, yet still possesses the same sex appeal, which she took full advantage of, Yes she Alice and Linda were all dating eachother at the same time, in this society it wasn&#39;t unheard of to have multiple lovers.<br />
<br />
And next to Lina, carrying a white and green case in their hand was Max, he was the one who was responsible for Alice&#39;s and Lina&#39;s bundles of joy currently growing within them, it had happened over four months ago, the trio of lovers had gone out to dinner to celebrate another success at birthing and rehomeing another &quot;litter&quot; as Lina called Alice&#39;s children she unbirth, they were five shots in, Alice being a bit of a lightweight drinker said something about them all having a few kids to call their own, but the last thing Alice would have guessed would have been both of them saying yes to the idea, and that&#39;s when they found Max.<br />
<br />
Max was of a fairly muscular build, not a body builder by a long shot, but was anything but scrawny or fat, if anything Alice practically had to pry Lina and Linda off him to get into the situation she is in today, Max had short blond hair that was swept all to one side, with the sides being tried short, he had three silver ring piercings on his left ear and bright green eyes, he had a black tribal tattoos down his right arm and along his back.<br />
<br />
And after the first night, after all three drunk and horny woman scrabbling to get at his truly impressive member, they wernt going to let go of him so easily, so they each took turns in seeing him again, untill two weeks after their faithful encounter they invited him to move in with them, after all they had the room, their hospital salary was impressive, but that was to be expected doing what they did, so in reality the trio was actually a foursome. <br />
<br />
However Max&#39;s appearance was far from a reflection of his personality, he was quite shy and timid, but he had a big heart which all three woman had fallen for instantly, and once he had found out about Alice&#39;s and Lina&#39;s pregnancy he was all hands on deck, always checking if they needed anything, always giving them a belly rub as he passed them, it was getting to the point of being flat out adorable, and Alice suspected that Linda wanted in, after all, she had been taking Max hostage for a week straight now, every night they would hear the springs of the mattress and the occasional thud of Max&#39;s beds headboard, pluss the blush that Max would have in his cheeks as he passed Linda, Alice was tempted to tease him about it, but for now she was content with their baby daddy trying to dodge the questions of what he had been up to.<br />
<br />
Alice&#39;s thoughts were interrupted as one of the babies began to stur, and her mindset was back on work, they had said for their relationship in work to be strictly professional, both to avoid any mistakes and to avoid any suspicion of their four way relationship, the staff here were grate and all but they were merciless when it came to rumours and gossip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there hon, how you doing&quot; said Max as he turned to place the case on opposite side of the bed to where Alice was sat, sitting down to so his back was against hers, before Lina came around to coo at the staring babies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there little ones, oh arnt you the most adorable babes iv ever seen, yes, you, are&quot; she said gently booking their noses, getting each to give a small giggle, then Lina gave a sigh &quot;oh how I would love to be in your shoes babe, you get to take theis cuties into your womb and have a belly full of five babies, I wish I could do what you do&quot; she said before gazing down at her belly &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t give my current babies up for anything&quot; she said before winking at Max &quot;think you could pump a few more into me big boy&quot; she slurred seductively, swaying her ass and cupping her small swell for emphasis, Max only blushed in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok OK, we get it your horny hon, but we have a job to do, and if we do a good job....well see about tonight, all of us&quot; said Max as he popped open the case.<br />
<br />
He was never this assertive, but if this was a hint for things to come, Alice wanted to make sure she did a REALY good job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok my Amazon princess, let&#39;s get to work, said Lina with a smile, holding one of the babies</p>
