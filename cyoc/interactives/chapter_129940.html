<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the longest time, there was this rumor that had floated around school about how Jessie&#39;s &quot;whiz&quot; took care of all her schoolwork. The word is was that it was some kid named Mike, who like Jeff was a total nerd, but was actually kinda cute if you were willing to look past his physical appearance. I felt that it was wrong for anyone to make someone else do their work, but hell, if I got to prance around as the queen bee, I deserved to have a little fun with it.<br />
<br />
Mike was waiting by his locker, his eyes trained for my approach. When I did arrive, he handed me something. It turned out to be a science report Jessie was supposed to turn in tomorrow, and Mike got ready to take off. Obviously, he expected everything to be the same as always, as in, Jessie would take the work and leave without so much as a thank you.<br />
<br />
But I wasn&#39;t the old Jessie. Instead, I leaned in close, ran my tongue up the side of his head, and whispered in his ear for him to meet me in the bathroom by the cafeteria during lunch. I told him he deserved a reward for doing my work. He seemed shocked, but I swore I could see him pumping his fist in the air as he walked away.<br />
<br />
Before lunch, I made sure to check my reflection in the mirror. I noticed that my face was a little shriveled from the heat, so I pulled down on the edges. I had to admit, Jeff had done some good work putting this thing together. Just then, the door opened.<br />
<br />
I pulled back in shock, half expecting that whoever had come in had seen me fiddling with my &quot;face&quot;. But no, it was just Mike. I led him into one of the stalls and pushed him down onto the toilet seat.<br />
<br />
A grin (or at least I thought it was a grin, it&#39;s kind of hard to smile through fake lips) spread across my face as I began swaying my hips, trying to get Mike in the mood. As it turns out, the kid didn&#39;t have a clue what was going on. Obviously, he was a virgin.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I decided to just get to the point. Unzipping my skirt and pulling down my panties, I let him get a good look at my new pussy. It was a perfect size, pink as cotton candy, and fully shaved. Mike started to get the hint, or at least his hormones began to kick in, because I could see something swelling up in his pants.<br />
<br />
Undoing his belt and zipper, I pulled them down to reveal his penis. And what a dick it was!! It was hard and thick, circumcised, and had a nice, fat tip. Reaching into my shirt, I retrieved the condom I&#39;d stashed in my bra for safekeeping and took it out. I myself was a virgin as well, but I still managed to get it on nice and tight. And now it was time for the big moment. Lowering my lower half with precision, I slowly slid onto his member, the lube on the condom helping to ease me in. <br />
<br />
And then I waited. Waited for Mike to start moving, you know, like guys were supposed to. But once again, he just sat there, enraptured by the feeling of his penis in the soft tissue of my vagina. So I decided to do it for him. I rose up, and then with one slam, I felt his tip break right through my hymen. When I rose up again, I could see blood staining the condom.<br />
<br />
Mike finally seemed to get it, as he started to thrust up and down into me. As the pleasure built up, he moved faster. I was so lost in the sensation that I didn&#39;t notice his hands moving to the sides of my face. When he felt was he thought was skin but really wasn&#39;t, a confused look appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
Shit!! Thinking quickly, I grabbed his wrists and put his hands under my shirt, where they landed firmly on my covered boobs. I also started to move faster, knowing that the sooner he finished, the sooner I could get him out.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he couldn&#39;t take it any longer. When I pulled out, the condom was completely filled with pure, white semen. I got him to his feet, and in quick succession, whipped the condom off, tied a knot, threw it in the toilet, and prayed that it would flush. Luckily, it did.<br />
<br />
Mike seemed completely out of it, so I shoved his erection back in his pants and sent him on his way. Once I was alone, I made sure to block the door before ripping Jessie&#39;s face off and letting it fall to the floor with a schlopping sound. <br />
<br />
Panting, I held it up in my hands. Jessie was an attractive girl, that&#39;s for sure. But now I was done being her for the day. Time to head back to Jeff&#39;s place.</p>
