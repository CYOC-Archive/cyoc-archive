<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked back at Jenny and saw the lust in her eyes. He knew the feeling well. He could only imagine how his old male body would have reacted to being in a hot tub with a naked woman.<br />
<br />
And now his girlfriend was getting to experience it firsthand. And HE was the naked woman! Jeff held his boobs even tighter and squeezed his legs together. He looked at Jenny&#39;s firm chest and large arms. He began to imagine the arms holding him down. He imagined that chest pressing against him, keeping his small, female body stuck against a mattress, ready and willing to let this large man climb between his own legs.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head to dispel the notion. Why on earth did he just fantasize about that?<br />
<br />
Jenny finally spoke. &quot;Come on... let me see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked into Jenny&#39;s eyes. This was still his girlfriend and he still trusted her. He slowly lowered his arms, allowing his breasts to sink downwards into the water. The began to float and bob along on the surface. Jenny smirked as her eyes followed their every move. Her right hand moved forward, gently grabbing one of Jeff&#39;s tits. He watched it with curiosity. The sensation of having his boob grabbed was unlike anything he&#39;d ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s hand covered his entire boob! Jeff had never felt so small before. If Jenny had told him he was shrinking, he&#39;d have believed it. But no, it was not another transformation, it was just the feeling of a large male dominating his mate using his size. To Jeff, this totally-normal human interaction was as alien as magic.<br />
<br />
Jenny squeezed the breast. &quot;They feel so great!&quot; she exclaimed. Jeff didn&#39;t want to admit it out loud, but he was beginning to agree. His mouth hung open and his breathing sped up. Jenny noticed, though, and pressed forward. She brought her other hand up and, with her large fingers, began to flick, pinch, and gently twist Jeff&#39;s nipples.<br />
<br />
This time is was too much to resist and Jeff moaned. The feminine sounds coming from his mouth shocked him, but he couldn&#39;t stop it. He transitioned from moaning right into a gentle whimper. He was not consciously aware of it, but his tightly-squeezed thighs began to loosen. His feet spread apart as his legs began to slowly open up.<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s fingers kept up their ministrations as she leaned towards Jeff&#39;s ears and whispered. &quot;I know how you feel, babe. I know exactly what your body wants. Just let me give you what I know you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff closed his eyes and began to nod. It was hard to form words but he knew exactly what he wanted. Jenny took one of her monster hands and let it drift down Jeff&#39;s torso. Entering the water, she gently tickled his belly button as her hand sunk lower and lower. Her fingertips gently grazed Jeff&#39;s pubic hair and finally found themselves between Jeff&#39;s smooth legs. It was very strange to not feel an erection between her boyfriend&#39;s legs, Jenny thought. There sure is a lot more room to move around here now.<br />
<br />
Jenny paused there, knowing the effect she was having. She drug her fingers back and forth on the inside of Jeff&#39;s leg, never getting closer to the prize between them. Jeff&#39;s whimpering had gotten louder and now he was almost growling. Jenny finally felt he had suffered enough and brought her hand forward. She cupped her fingers under his round butt and pressed her palm into his crotch. In one motion she had squished his vulva and clit into one warm, wet mass. To Jeff, this reminded him of having his cock deep-throated. It was very rare for a single motion to touch every part of his genitals at once, and Jenny had just done it with ease.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the water from the tub leave his pussy right as the warm wetness inside him exploded. He felt the juices leak out of his little hole and his groans turned to gasps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny!&quot; His eyes shot open. &quot;I&#39;m going to... going to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled. &quot;Are you about to...&quot; she paused while simultaneously bringing her pointer finger up to Jeff&#39;s pussy. With one smooth motion she plunged it all the way inside Jeff&#39;s vagina and curled it upwards.<br />
<br />
She finished her sentence &quot;...cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt too many things happen all at once. His lower lips had been spread open. His vagina was gripping a thick intruder, vibrating with confusion. Jenny&#39;s finger had found and was tickling his G-spot. Her other fingers were pinching his nipple. And all while the heel of her palm continued to knead and press Jeff&#39;s clit in a circular motion.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s butt clenched. His back arched. He felt sexual pleasure somewhat similar to what he&#39;d known before, but all mixed together with the sensation of being penetrated - something he could barely comprehend. His thighs locked and flinched and his female body unleashed an orgasm unlike any he&#39;d ever felt as a male. He began to vibrate and squeal.<br />
<br />
&quot;My pussy... my... I&#39;m... Jenny! I&#39;m a girl! I&#39;m a girl!&quot; His managed to look down his body and see his jiggling tit with Jenny&#39;s large finger entering his body further down beneath the water. The sight made him think of being stabbed and it felt scary and wrong all while his body was telling him it felt good. The incongruity was insanely strange. &quot;I&#39;m... a... WOMAN!&quot; cried Jeff as his orgasm ran laps around his body.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s orgasm made him feel incredibly female. He was aware of the long hair cascading over his shoulders. He flexed his toes and could somehow tell they were half the size of his old ones. He even imagined painting them red after this was over. His butt felt huge and his waist impossibly small. As his hips shook he realized that their new shape was designed for birthing children. Jeff could be impregnated. Jeff could become a MOTHER. The thought kept his orgasm as strong as when it started. His new body liked the idea of getting pregnant, Jeff was certain of this.<br />
<br />
He threw his head back and was acutely aware of how far away the ceiling looked. He wasn&#39;t just female... Jeff was SMALL. A tiny, helpless woman completely under the control of his large, hairy girlfriend... no... of HER BOYfriend. Jeff had a boyfriend and her boyfriend was making her cum.<br />
<br />
Jenny grinned. This was a lot of fun to watch. She knew exactly what Jeff was feeling and kept moving her hands to keep it going.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m Jenny now...&quot; Jeff said as his orgasm waned. &quot;I&#39;m a girl... mmmmm... my pussy...my boyfriend loves my pussy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny slowed her finger&#39;s movements in shock. Jeff calling her a boyfriend was unexpected. Jeff&#39;s mindset had changed very quickly. Apparently the female orgasm was a life-changing experience. He had become very accepting of his new sex all of a sudden. Jenny was surprised, but happy. Maybe now Jeff would be open to more experimentation. Things like...<br />
<br />
Jenny&#39;s thoughts returned to her cock, now harder than ever before. &quot;Oh... I almost forgot I had that&quot; she thought to herself.</p>
