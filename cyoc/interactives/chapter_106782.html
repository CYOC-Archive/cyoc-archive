<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having walked out on deck Jared quickly located his best friend, Thomas. Who was a muscular fit, brown haired teen. Seeing Thomas relaxing on the wall Jared went over to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how&#39;s the water.&quot; Jared couldn&#39;t help being a little smug, by showing up late he missed his coaches dreaded warm up sets.<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39; bright blue eyes locked on Jared&#39;s&#39;, &quot;Ha...Ha...you think your so funny don&#39;t you.&quot; Thomas was condescending as he spoke. &quot;You think you got out of the hard part, just look at the main set.&quot; Here Thomas moved one wet arm out of the water to point at the white board used to show the days drills and workouts.<br />
<br />
Jared let out a grown seeing the thousand yard sprint set, but quickly sucking up the frustration he felt he jumped in next to Thomas. &quot;So how&#39;s your day going?&quot; He asked trying to make conversation before Mr. Matthews came out to direct them into their next set.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good really, my parents are thinking about taking me and my brother out of town for the spring break that&#39;s coming up.&quot; Thomas said as he moved around in the water to face Jared.<br />
<br />
&#39;Great.&#39; Jared thought sarcastically, before replying. &quot;That sounds like a lot of fun, you excited then?&quot; Jared questioned as he but emphases on the excited part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you know me. When would I ever have fun with my whole family. They are too overbearing and alway judging me for what I think about, and what I believe in. I would rather spend spring vacation here with you and my friends.&quot; Thomas said as he smiled and relaxed in the water.<br />
<br />
Before anything else could be said, suddenly...<br />
<br />
The assistant coach, Mrs. Clover, came trudging out of her office on the far side of the pool. They average middle age women approached the center of the deck, before clearing her throat to get the swimmers attention. Jared and Thomas, only two of many swimmers were the first to divert away from their conversation and give their undivided attention to coach Clover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright swimmers listen up, practice has been cancelled today because of a emergency broadcast that just aired.&quot; Even as she spoke the words Jared and Thomas grew worried, while the rest of the swimmers seemed divided between exuberance over canceled practice and worry over the reason.<br />
<br />
Coach Clover had stopped speaking for a moment to retrieve a piece of paper from her shorts, after finding it she proceeded to unfold it and then read from it. &quot;Their is a quarantine now in effect, experts from the CDC have discovered and new virus outbreak in some of the nearby towns. So as a way to prevent exposure and possible infection we have been advised against public events, and our encouraged to remain in our homes.&quot; She said, before refolding the piece of paper, and then finishing with. &quot;I want you guys to hop out, and towel off. I am going to go find head coach Matthews and then we will allow you to leave in a calm and orderly fashion.&quot; After finishing speaking she proceeded to exit out of the pool and into the males locker room, where head coach Matthews was last seen. <br />
<br />
She was gone for only a few moments when the conversation broke out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should stay home for a while?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s likely just some flu strain that has everything up in the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey did you hear about what happens in Jonestown?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I headed that the entire town just vanished, poof?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No really?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and creeper still, they found shredded clothing everywhere, but no signs of the people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one knows?&quot;  <br />
<br />
A sudden shrill howl echoed through the pool, coming from the males locker room. It&#39;s sharp noise stopping all conversation. <br />
<br />
Coach clover came running out of the locker room, clothes in disarray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh GOD!&quot; She screamed before a large blue flew from the same rooms and collided into her. <br />
<br />
Before them was Mr. Matthews, or at least they thought it was him, his clothes were torn and shredded, and his back was facing them. Yet it wasn&#39;t that which made him stand out, no rather it was the very obvious tail that stuck out of his waistband, wagging with great intensity. His was hunched over Mrs. Clover, drool pooling on her trembling body. She had bullets of sweat pouring down her face, and as she faced the many different young adults she mouthed &#39;Help Me.&#39;<br />
<br />
Seeing what was going on several young men moved to remove Mr. Matthews from the assistant coach. &quot;Coach Matthews, can you tell us what&#39;s wrong, how can we help you?&quot; One student asked, but was meet with only a low growling noise.<br />
<br />
No longer willing to wait for a response several of the larger more muscular swimmers moved to grab at Mr. Matthews, but were forced to withdraw when he had turned around. Mr. Matthews face was slightly pushed out, giving it canine proportions. His teeth were razor sharp, with a long flat tong hanging between their gap. His noise was pitch black and covered in a light sheen of moisture. Worse was that he had patches of what seemed to be fur growing from all over his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear lord, is that Mr. Matthews?&quot; When of the younger swimmer whispered out when they all saw him, unknowingly echoing the thoughts of his peers.<br />
<br />
The men/boys who had already started to move forward stopped and froze, this...thing was their teacher, but they had no clue what had happened to cause it. Mrs. Clover let out a whimper that drew the attention of the now transforming Mr. Matthews, he let out a low growl and dragged his tong over her face. Covering her in thick slimy saliva, before grabbing her with a mutated hand and dragging her back toward the locker rooms.<br />
<br />
The swimmers thought for sure she would scream, but instead stood petrified in fear as they watched her own face start to slowly push out, the noise darkening to match Mr. Matthews. She lightly panted, her tongue gaining length and width, as she was pulled into the locker room. The last the swimmers saw of her was her two ears, as they slowly pointed upwards on her head.<br />
<br />
