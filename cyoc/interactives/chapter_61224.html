<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So the two of you have become involved in the ranching industry?&quot; Meredeth commented to Molly and I was we helped take the things Frank Rhoer was intending to take with him back into his home. Both of his daughters seemed excited about their family getting a chance to stay together.<br />
<br />
&quot;By accident really,&quot; I answered, &quot;I didn't actually want the cattle, as Molly and I don't know a thing about the ins and outs of ranching, and they' be of little use to us as anything more then something to hunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Regardless, it's a good business,&quot; Frank Rhoer commented as we set some boxes down on one of his couches, &quot;it gives a lot people out in this part of the country work and feeds the slaughter houses that you and Molly are likely dependent on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't change the fact that we likely couldn't keep them alive long enough without either a lot of help or hired hands,&quot; Molly replied, &quot;which is why George thought of you, Uncle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, for saving him from Beauregard,&quot; Frank Rhoer responded, &quot;I understand, and it's very noble of your husband, Molly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Molly looked toward me, a slight twinkle in her eyes, &quot;he is noble.&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon had me in a hug and was nuzzling my neck and shoulder with her muzzle. I wrapped my arm around her back and nuzzled her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't go all sappy on us,&quot; Meredeth commented, &quot;we still got work to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Frank Rhoer nodded, &quot;I would like to see the cattle you've been given to try and assess what they need and see the brand mark you have for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brand?&quot; I wondered, I had told him that I only just got the cattle. Certainly he knew that I had no idea as to what to use for a brand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, an image or system of letters and numbers, or a symbol of some kind made out of metal and burned into the cow's hide,&quot; Frank Rhoer explained, &quot;it generally identifies ownership of the animal and cuts down on potential charges of wrestling cattle among ranchers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what a brand is,&quot; I explained with a sigh, &quot;... we only just received the cattle today. I have no idea on what to brand them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's more work then,&quot; Frank Rhoer sighed, &quot;it means we'll need to meet with someone who has the tools and metal to make a branding iron and see if he's willing to sell the metal and loan the equipment... Beauregard's is likely city property now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That part is easy,&quot; I answered as I handed Frank Rhoer the slip of paper Albert Ames had given me, &quot;the man won the auction has offered to make one, should I come up wit a design.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer looked at the paper and gave a nervous sigh, &quot;well, at least that'll be one problem out of th way. We'll still need to see the cattle. I can give you a brand design to use... where are the cattle being held?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now they're in a pen on Michael York's ranch,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael York?&quot; Frank Rhoer asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Molly nodded, &quot;he's the one who gave us Bandhavgarh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And has named us as the heirs to his land in his will,&quot; I added, &quot;largely for standing up to Beauregard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This could be a problem,&quot; Frank Rhoer then said, looking down with a heavy sigh. I watched him twiddle one foot in a circle for a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;A problem, Uncle?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael York's one of the &quot;Old Guard&quot; of the ranchers here,&quot; Nessie commented, &quot;his family's been ranching here for years before Beauregard moved here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But while ranching was big business to Beauregard, who had the money to treat it as such,&quot; Meredeth continued, &quot;for ranchers like Michael York, they've largely done it to get by. Their herds are smaller, their lands are smaller, but they've succeeded as they have, and don't like the fact that Beauregard has tried to make ranching work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because he's put many of these &quot;Old Guard&quot; ranchers, as you call them, out of business,&quot; I commented, &quot;and that Beauregard hasn't treated many of the younger folks with small herds that well either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and Beauregard may be the cause of some of their resentment,&quot; Frank Rhoer sighed, &quot;and it's been bad blood between ranchers like York and Beauregard since Beauregard moved here. Because of that bad blood between them, I and your cousins, Molly, have not been on good terms with ranchers like Michael York.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Water under the bridge,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;he's such a sweet old man. I'm sure we can work something out.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Our next stop was to drive out to Michael York's ranch. Nessie drove with Meredeth in the middle with Frank Rhoer on the passenger's side of the truck's cab scribbling on a piece of paper. Molly and I, because of our greater size, and because the Rhoer's truck had no back seat had to lay in the bed of the truck. It was not an easy journey as we jostled and bounced with every bump and pothole, and Nessie was actually going slower then the posted speed limit.<br />
<br />
&quot;When it is time to go home, we are going to walk,&quot; Molly said to me, &quot;...we're filthy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe this will be cub training,&quot; I commented, &quot;You know they'll hop through any mud they'll find.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you know that?&quot; Molly questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's what I did as a little kid,&quot; I managed to shrug before a bounce jostled me enough that I ended up flat on my chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nessie called from the cab.<br />
<br />
We then continued to jostle along. Things got smoother once we got to paved roads, but I still kept my head down. I also made sure Molly did the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;George,&quot; she complained, &quot;I want to see what he's drawing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably the brand he thinks we should use,&quot; I told her, &quot;just keep your head down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?&quot; She wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because technically, this is illegal,&quot; I answered, &quot;we're not on private land. It's a minor offense really, and a lot of people do this... but it's still dangerous. We could be thrown in a collision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we don't fit in the car, and can't use any seat-buckle,&quot; Molly pointed out, &quot;and Uncle Frank doesn't have a backseat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't change the law,&quot; I reminded her, &quot;and to a certain extent, if we are to be accepted by humanity, we will have to accept humanity's laws... at least until there are enough tiger people to constitute a large enough voting block.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that'll happen?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we have cubs... and they grow up, get married, have cubs of their own... I'd say that it's possible,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
Molly was unable to say more as we transitioned back onto a dirt road to head out to Michael York's ranch. As we did so, Molly and I were again dealing with the various bumps and potholes that made up many dirt roads.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Molly and I were very uncomfortable when we finally arrived at Michael York's home. We were both quick to hop out, though it took us a little while to brush all the dust off of us and gain the strength in our leg muscles back after all the jostling that had gone on in the trip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Frank Rhoer admitted, &quot;the suspension has never been good on this thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I slowly nodded as he came closer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I have the design you can use for your brand,&quot; Frank Rhoer spoke, and handed me the sheet of paper he had been drawing on.<br />
<br />
It looked like a very crudely drawn outline of a tiger's head from the front. The &quot;ears&quot; of the image met at a central point on the head before rising up to a set point before curving down to a point that was at the same height as where the ears began. From there, there was a wide curve the vaguely resembled the outline of the fur around both mine and Molly's cheeks, though mine was more pronounced then Molly's. Next was a pair of sideways reversed &quot;s&quot; shapes that completed the image of the underside of a jaw and the chin. Inside the outline were a capital letter &quot;G&quot; and &quot;M&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks interesting,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I thought that would be appropriate,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;anything more fancy probably wouldn't work from the sense of making the brand making it work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Molly and I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now to see if Mr. York will listen to you,&quot; Frank Rhoer commented and motioned for Molly and I to take the lead.<br />
<br />
We did take the lead and quietly knocked on Michael York's door. We heard a brief &quot;coming&quot; come from inside the house before the elderly man appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;George, Molly, a pleasure to see you,&quot; he said in a friendly voice, &quot;are you here for the first real look at your herd? They look awfully good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure, sir,&quot; I spoke, &quot;but for moment we're here to talk with you along with a few guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked past Molly and I to see Frank Rhoer and his family there and his look soured a little bit, but he accepted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, come on in,&quot; Michael York opened his door and let us all in.<br />
<br />
Molly and I had to crouch to move through the house, but we managed. Frank Rhoer and his daughters followed behind us. Once we made it to his living room, he offered Frank Rhoer and his daughters a seat. Molly and I sat down on the floor beside the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is on your mind?&quot; Michael York asked, trying his best to sound polite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. York, this is my Uncle and my cousins,&quot; Molly spoke first, &quot;George has told me about the cattle Mr. Ames has given us, and while we appreciate the generosity, neither of us are ranchers, and the cattle would probably die before we'd ever had a chance to learn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know who they are,&quot; Michael York grumbled, &quot;people that hung onto Beauregard's coattails for all it was worth... essentially drove many a good man out of work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beauregard was the only one who'd hire me,&quot; Frank Rhoer spoke in his own defense, &quot;I had no desire to put anyone out of work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael York was about to argue, but I managed to cut him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;And with Beauregard's arrest, they are out of work,&quot; I spoke, &quot;and since Molly and I know nothing about ranching... and are fairly busy for the most part, I had figured it would be best to let them manage the small herd Mr. Ames has given us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could help...&quot; Michael York protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've already done so much for us,&quot; Molly told him, &quot;managing these additional cattle would only make your job harder. George and I have no intention on expanding the herd beyond what breaks even, and my Uncle and Cousins will need work... my Uncle isn't a bad man. He may have made mistakes, but he's willing to learn from them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not seek to drive us out?&quot; Michael York asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, sir,&quot; Frank Rhoer said respectfully, &quot;and despite what Beauregard likely bragged about when he made his attempts to buy your land, I was never involved in his decision making.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Michael York commented, &quot;and how do you plan to pay these three, Mr. Wayne?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My thought was to let them take the &quot;profits&quot; from the sale of the cattle for their payment,&quot; I replied, &quot;Molly and I are doing fairly well with our present jobs for the moment, and Mr. Rhoer will need it more then Molly and I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can even help your people with your own animals,&quot; Nessie volunteered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not anyone's enemy,&quot; Frank Rhoer spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Michael York then sighed, &quot;I suppose I could allow it... I suppose. So long a you don't drastically enlarge the herd to try and drive me out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd eat the cattle that would threaten to do that,&quot; Molly promised him, &quot;George and I want to give my Uncle the chance to do what he knows how to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Michael York replied a he stood up, and offered his hand to Frank Rhoer, &quot;I'll give you the chance. You won't face trespassing charges from me... though, I'll have to show you my facilities because I don't want my tools out of place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Frank Rhoer shook Michael York's hand eagerly &quot;I won't let you or George or Molly down... I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and hopped that we had put an end to all the bad blood that went around Columbia Falls' ranching community.</p>
