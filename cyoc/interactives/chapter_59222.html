<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking around the large open-plan room, Dave sought for inspiration. There were just over a dozen people in the room, including the kangaroo-hybrid figure of Jenny, who occasionally hopped through his field of view with all four breasts heaving around. The sight still made him smile, he didn't think he'd ever get tired of it. Perhaps at some point he should restore her awareness of what had happened to her for a while? It might be amusing to see her reaction.<br />
<br />
While he was thinking, the elevator a few feet to his left opened with a soft ping and he looked to see the weird shape of Ralph gliding smoothly out, his forward-jutting torso and huge breasts leading the way for the rest of his mostly-inanimate body. His breasts wobbling massively as his wheels bumped over the lip of the elevator doorway, Ralph looked down at them and sighed in defeated exasperation. He made a very odd sight from the side, his torso protruding quite a long way out from a narrow waist, and then curving up so it was nearly in a normal position, with his longer, slender neck bending back to make up the rest of the curve so he could look ahead normally.<br />
<br />
As he approached, followed by Maria who was checking something off a list on a clipboard, Dave stood and picked up a couple of disposable cups that someone had left on the chair next to him. Walking over to Ralph, he said cheerily, &quot;Hi, Ralph, how's it going?&quot;, and reached over to casually lift his rear flap and drop the cups into him, then walked on past. Ralph stopped dead in his tracks, startled and upset at being used like a simple garbage can. Dave walked away without looking back, and after a moment Maria prodded Ralph into motion again.<br />
<br />
Grinning where Ralph couldn't see it, Dave waited until they had disappeared down the corridor, then walked back and sat down again. He'd probably change Ralph back at some point, but perhaps leave him with a memento of his time as a cleaning machine centaur. Perhaps he'd change back into this form when something needed cleaning? Or maybe he should keep the breasts, or the hose. He shrugged, it was something to think about another time.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, what to try next? It was a lot of fun, this editing of reality. Eventually he came back to Bob, who had just made a remark about Jenny's breasts. Obviously although no-one saw anything odd about her being mostly a kangaroo, large bouncing breasts drew attention regardless of the body they were part of.<br />
<br />
Dave smiled slightly to himself. OK, Bob  it was. Now what to do, and how? A little thought, and he flipped to a new page in his notebook, which he was beginning to think of as his little book of fun. At the top he neatly wrote with his finger-pen, &quot;Bob will not notice these changes unless I point them out to him, when he will realize what has happened. He will stop noticing them again either when I tell him not to or after five minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, as he had done with Ralph, he spent a few minutes carefully filling half the page with detailed instructions for Bob's change, but in this case, he made the change occur immediately, not slowly over time. Looking up, he inspected the figure of Bob, standing ten feet away, with interest and bemusement. Despite having caused it, he thought the results looked very strange.<br />
<br />
Above the waist Bob was unchanged, still wearing his suit. From the waist down, though, it was a different story completely. Again, he had gone for a centaur-like shape, based this time on a female deer. But it was much more than that. Bob had the lower body of a deer, alright, but his legs looked more like something you'd find on a high-quality dining table. They were made of dark, polished wood, basically cylindrical in shape with a nicely turned, slender tapering shape to them, about three feet long. All four legs were identical, and terminated in carved wooden claws which were clutching a large glass ball, just like you saw on some higher end Victorian furniture.<br />
<br />
The legs were completely rigid, without joints, and Bob could only bend them at the hips, and then only a relatively small amount compared to the animals legs his new form looked like it should have. The legs would move forward and back, and left and right, but not in any other direction. At the point his new solid feet met the floor, the legs would move perhaps a foot or so from straight down. The fur of his deer body smoothly changed into french polished wood over a distance of around a couple of inches. Even though they were inanimate wood he had full sensation throughout them.<br />
<br />
Added to these changes, hanging directly under the center of his deer torso was what was clearly an udder, but not one from any normal animal. It was a large symmetrical bag, with a capacity of a good five gallons, fitted with four absurdly large nipples pointing out somewhat sideways from the bottom. The thing was about a foot across when it joined his body, and swelled out into a bag nearly twice that diameter near the bottom, looking a bit like a very large balloon filled with water. It was fur-less, made of silky smooth normal-looking skin.<br />
<br />
Dave had changed Bob so that this udder was what had originally been his penis, and all the sensations of that vanished organ mapped through to it. As it filled it would feel like he was getting an erection, and being milked would be like getting a continuous low-level orgasm, one that went on and on. Plus his female deer vagina was completely functional as well. Anything he drank would go into making milk, but even if he didn't drink much he would still produce it, but more slowly. Even without special effort he would need to be milked twice a day, and if he went on a drinking session at the bar he'd need a LOT of milking done to him.<br />
<br />
Watching him for a moment, Dave put his notebook and said loud enough to be heard by Bob, &quot;Hey, Bob, can you come here for a moment?&quot; Bob looked toward him, excused himself from Jenny, who hadn't noticed anything different but was still a little irritated by his recent comment, and made his way over to Dave.<br />
<br />
Who had a very hard time keeping a grin off his face. The way Bob moved was fascinating to watch. As he'd designed that body, Bob could only move his front legs or rear legs together, not independently. To turn around, he moved the rear ones to one side and the front ones in the other direction, a motion that made his new deertaur body rock from side to side, which in turn made his dangling udder sway massively sideways in opposition to this movement. The udder was so heavy that it pushed his body around noticeably.<br />
<br />
When he was pointing in the right direction, he walked by swinging his front legs out, then catching up with the back ones, in quite small but rapid steps. This was accompanied with lots of muffled thumps from the glass balls that made up his feet, and his udder swung back and forth in time with his steps, coming out far enough that it was between his front legs at the apex of it's swing. The speed of the swinging synced up to his steps with a few legs motions, and helped his body move smoothly, but with a very odd gait.<br />
<br />
If he ran, it would swing faster, but if full would brush against the insides of his legs both front and back, limiting his speed to a walk. The fuller he got the slower he'd be forced to move. <br />
<br />
Bob approached Dave, who stood and watched him. As he neared, he slowed down carefully to allow the swinging udder to come to rest. Once he stopped in front of Dave the udder continued to swing back and forth for ten seconds or so. &quot;What did you want, Dave?&quot;, Bob inquired. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have to talk to you for a moment in my office, right away. Can you go there immediately, and I'll join you in a moment.&quot; Bob looked surprised and a little worried, but nodded and slowly turned in place, then began walking. Dave watched him negotiate the cubicle farm, stopping and turning at each intersection, his udder swinging back and forth, and from side to side in a way that made him want to laugh, to the sound of rapid solid footsteps. As he crossed the tiled area outside the kitchen the thumps turned into a fusillade of loud clicks.<br />
<br />
Going over to Bob's cubicle, Dave looked over the low wall and inspected strange thing that had replaced the chair that had originally been there. It was a U-shaped platform on a spring-loaded lift mechanism, with a large cup-shaped device beneath it. In the cup were four holes, and some hoses led to another machine under the side desk.<br />
<br />
This was Bob's new chair. He walked over it with his udder going into the open end of the U shape, and then pressed a button on his desk. The platform would raise and lift his body off the floor, as he couldn't bend his legs. The cup machine was an automatic milker, which when activated would raise and hold his udder, with the nipples going through the holes into suction mechanisms that would milk him into the container under the desk. Dave had set it up so that Bob now supplied the milk for the company coffee machines throughout the building. They did at least pay him for it.<br />
<br />
Nodding in satisfaction, Dave turned to Jenny who was standing at the entrance to her cubicle adjacent to Bob's one, looking at him curiously, and said &quot;Don't let him make comments like that to you. If he does, let me know and I'll take care of it.&quot; She nodded, looking briefly irritated again.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. He's one to talk, though, his mammary development is much more impressive than mine, for god's sake!&quot; Dave nodded and smiled, but not for the reason that Jenny thought, then went back to his office and the waiting Bob.</p>
