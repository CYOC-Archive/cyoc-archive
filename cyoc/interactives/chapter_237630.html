<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David woke up naked in an unfamiliar body. Everything felt off, the sounds, the smells, the sights, it&#39;s all very foreign. He was in the same room where the doctors put him to sleep, but it felt different, more vibrant. He looked down and saw the body of a chiseled Greek god, with pecs, deep abs, strong arms coated with a light layer of blonde hair. He was shocked to see his new member, dangling between his new strong legs, bigger than his old one. As he got up, he felt a strand of hair cover his eye, he realized that his hair was longer, much longer than his old buzzcut. And the color was blonde, a very light shade of blonde, like the one Brad has.<br />
<br />
After getting up, he inspected the room, and noticed a table with his old body laying there, motionless and lifeless. His old body wasn&#39;t ugly; he never trained or was athletic as Brad. Since he could walk Brad would always try sports like swimming and cycling. His old body was lean, not too muscular, with dark hair and good features. He was going to miss that body, as he wondered what would happen to it. He also noticed a big mirror, and saw his reflection for the first time. He could recognize Brad&#39;s features, but he was jacked, he looked like a surfer, but more elegant. There was something about his new body that made his member grow.<br />
<br />
Before he could continue, the doctors came in and started asking him questions about how he was feeling. <br />
&quot;Oh, so you are finally up. We are glad to say that the experiment was a success&quot; said a doctor. <br />
<br />
They gave him some clothes and when David asked why he was so perfect, the doctors mentioned that they ensured the best genes would develop Brad&#39;s body, thus the clone being a perfect version of his brother. <br />
&quot;So that means that Brad won&#39;t grow up to look like me, unless he trains very hard and lives a perfect life.&quot; asked David, glad that he won&#39;t have a twin brother in the future. <br />
The family welcomed the new David with a bit of shock, seeing how much he resembled Bradley, only much older and much more muscular. <br />
&quot;David lowks swo bigg. Am I gwoing to be big too?&quot; asked Bradley. <br />
&quot;Wow bro, I expected you to be a scrawny twink, not a greek statue come to life.&quot; said Lucas with a shoked expression. <br />
&quot;Yeah, I was expecting much worse, but can work with this&quot; said David while flexing his new arm. <br />
<br />
As David was walking, he took note of how everything felt so different, especially his muscles and new member swinging between his legs. After getting home, David tried to play his old video games but felt anxious, like he had too much energy all pent up, so he decided to take his bike and go to the local swimming pool. He put on his old speedo, now too tight on his new muscular body, like all his clothes. On the bike ride there, he felt so much more free than he felt before, the air in his hair, the new muscles working together to give his bike speed.<br />
<br />
He reached the pool, and got in, the same feeling being mirrored while swimming. He took notice of how girls looked at him, a few of them giving him their number. However, he noticed that he wouldn&#39;t get as excited when seeing a babe in a bikini like in his old body, instead, he was eyeing up the muscular lifeguard in his red speedo. When he got home, he wanted to watch some porn, thinking that the clone body hadn&#39;t cummed yet. He tried to watch his usual blonde beach babes porn, but he couldn&#39;t get hard. He was fantasizing about the hot guys from the pool, and got hard. So, he googled some gay porn and cummed like never before. He realized that Bradley was probably gay, and those genes passed down in the clone body. He really didn&#39;t want to be gay, missing his old body, but also enjoying the new muscles that he now had.<br />
<br />
When playing with his old sex toys, he realized he was a bottom, which upset him even more. He lay on his bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to process everything. His thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. It was Mariah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, David,&quot; she said, peeking her head inside. &quot;Can I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; he replied, sitting up.<br />
<br />
She walked in and sat on the edge of his bed. &quot;How are you holding up? This whole thing must be crazy for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s... it&#39;s a lot,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I don&#39;t even know who I am anymore. The old me is dead, and this new me... I don&#39;t know if I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you look pretty amazing,&quot; she said, glancing at his new physique. &quot;But I get it. It&#39;s a huge change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said, feeling a bit better. &quot;I guess I just need time to adjust.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; she asked gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; he replied, shaking his head. &quot;But thanks for asking.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, understanding. &quot;If you ever do, I&#39;m here. Just remember, you&#39;re still my brother, no matter what.&quot;<br />
<br />
He smiled faintly. &quot;Thanks, Mariah. That means a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
After she left, David decided to take a shower. He stood under the warm water, letting it cascade over his new body. He ran his hands over his chest, feeling the defined muscles. It was both familiar and strange. He closed his eyes, letting the steam envelop him.<br />
<br />
As he dried off, he heard another knock on the door. This time, it was Lucas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can I come in?&quot; he asked, sounding a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; David replied, wrapping a towel around his waist.<br />
<br />
Lucas stepped inside, looking unsure. &quot;I just wanted to say... sorry. For everything. I was being a jerk about the whole thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
David raised an eyebrow. &quot;Wow, did hell freeze over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas chuckled. &quot;Maybe. But seriously, I didn&#39;t think things through. You&#39;re still my brother, and I should have been more supportive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; David sighed. &quot;I understand. It&#39;s been a crazy week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Lucas agreed. &quot;Look, if you need anything, let me know. I&#39;m here for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Lucas,&quot; David said, genuinely appreciating the gesture.<br />
<br />
After Lucas left, David decided to explore his new body a bit more. He lay back on his bed and began touching himself, feeling the difference in his new member. It was larger, more sensitive, and he felt a rush of pleasure unlike anything he&#39;d experienced before.<br />
<br />
As he continued, images of the lifeguard at the pool filled his mind. He pictured the man&#39;s muscular frame, the way his speedo clung to his hips. David&#39;s breath quickened, and his hand moved faster. He imagined the lifeguard&#39;s lips on his own, his hands exploring David&#39;s new body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, there was a loud knock on the door. &quot;David, are you decent?&quot; It was Mom.<br />
<br />
Startled, David quickly covered himself with a sheet. &quot;Uh, yeah, come in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mom walked in, carrying a tray with sandwiches and juice. &quot;Thought you might be hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; David said, feeling guilty for being caught in such a vulnerable moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything alright?&quot; she asked, setting the tray down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just... thinking,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
She nodded, sensing his discomfort. &quot;Well, if you need to talk, I&#39;m here. We&#39;re all adjusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I just... I feel lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it time,&quot; she advised. &quot;You&#39;ll find your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
After she left, David stared at the ceiling once more. He knew he had to figure out who he was now. But for now, he needed to focus on what he could control. He picked up a sandwich and took a bite, savoring the familiar taste. As he ate, he thought about the choices ahead of him.</p>
