<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark won the case against the ASPCA. Since all Mark had done so far was whack Jeff on the behind, the court ruled that there was no case for <br />
cruelty to animals. The other cases were still pending a decision. The official charges were theft and kidnapping. It was called kidnapping <br />
because Mark was holding Jeff against his will even though Jeff was not being held by force or any way normally associated with kidnapping. It <br />
was Jeff's will that Mark sell him to the Hansens and the only reason why Jeff didn't move to the Hansens was because Mark hadn't sold him yet <br />
so even Jeff considered Mark his owner but the court was considering the possibility that Jeff should have the legal right to force Mark to sell <br />
him since the TransDem satellites influenced everyone to allow Jeff some autonomy to choose his own future.<br />
<br />
With no cruelty charges against Mark and Mark still being Jeff's owner, Jeff was released from the kennel where he'd been staying to go live <br />
with Mark.<br />
<br />
Mark was still distraught about Victoria. It was a clear suicide so there were few legal problems but it can still shake a person up to find a dead <br />
person in their home and the suicide note made Mark feel a little guilty. He tried to shake the guilt off and put all the blame on Victoria but he <br />
couldn't quite get rid of all the guilt. Mark also wanted to blame Jeff and to blame anyone else he could except himself.<br />
<br />
When Jeff came home, he was immediately tackled and tied up. Mark was very violent and beat Jeff until his ass was red.<br />
<br />
Mark said, &quot;I've heard that you don't know your place until someone has been up your ass. Is that the only way to make a good dog out of you? <br />
Are you going to continue to defy me until I've taken your cherry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark raped Jeff then and continued to beat on him the entire time. Jeff felt like he was being ripped open. Afterward he rolled over on his side <br />
and Mark grabbed his balls. &quot;You see that. You enjoyed it, didn't you.&quot; Mark yelled. &quot;This proves that you want to be a good dog slave. You want <br />
me to own you. You just needed me to take you to convince you that you want to belong to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;No, I don't want to be your dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark squeezed Jeff's balls and Jeff was screaming. Mark shouted, &quot;I ought to take these nuts away from you too. You'll be a lot happier once all <br />
your willfulness is sterilized out of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark continued to beat Jeff but there was a knock at the door. Mark quickly tied Jeff up so he couldn't escape and gagged him.<br />
<br />
Josh was at the door and seeing Josh, Mark grabbed him and pulled him inside too. &quot;All you dogs need to be put in your place. You've been a <br />
bad influence on my Jeff with your independence. The world will be a lot happier once you know your place, bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh was also overpowered and tied up. As Mark prepared to rape Josh in front of Jeff, Jeff screamed and tried to fight. He would do anything to <br />
prevent Josh from being raped but the ropes held him tight.<br />
<br />
Josh saw the condition Jeff was in and soon realized that Jeff had just been raped. Between howls of pain as Josh's ass was raped by Mark, Josh <br />
yelled, &quot;You bastard. How dare you rape Jeff like that. He's been a good dog to you. I ought to cut off your nuts so you can never rape Jeff <br />
again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark reached down and gave Josh's balls a squeeze. Josh screamed as Mark shouted, &quot;You mean nuts like these. Your the one who doesn't <br />
deserve to have your own balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door again and both Josh and Jeff were left in the room tied up and whimpering in pain. Jeff managed to spit out his <br />
gag. They both said to each other that they were sorry that they couldn't protect each other. Next thing they knew, Mark was dragging Callie <br />
into the room and being very violent.<br />
<br />
Then both Jeff and Josh felt an adrenaline surge as if possessed. They pulled their hands free from the ropes ignoring the rope burns, torn skin, <br />
blood and dislocated joints they got in the process. They were soon on top of Mark and together, they beat him senseless. When they stopped, <br />
Mark was still alive but unable to move and groaning in agony.<br />
<br />
With cum still dribbling out of both their asses, Jeff and Josh escorted Callie out of there, one on either side of her as guard dogs to protect her <br />
from anymore violence.</p>
