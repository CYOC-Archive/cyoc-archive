<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As nervous as he was thinking about all the stuff Clark told him, a real sense of giddiness was also racing through Trevor’s mind. He was actually about to become a golden eagle!<br />
<br />
Finding a vacant transformation room, Trevor stepped in and shut the door behind him. The room wasn’t much to look at. It was just a large square room with a dirt floor and walls lined with thick wood paneling, lit by a pair of skylights built into the ceiling. A couple of other lights were bolted into the wall behind wire mesh. A long bench lined the wall just underneath the lights. Directly across from his was a heavy steel door. The resorts rules were painted in large yellow letters across the black surface.<br />
<br />
Setting the bottle down on the bench next to bin Clark had told him about, Trevor got to work at undressing and putting his belongings in the box. After he was done, he grabbed the bottle and took a few quick swigs of the tasteless liquid before he’d downed the entire bottle.<br />
<br />
Letting out a sigh, he stepped over to the bench and sat the bottle down on top of it before stepping over to the middle of the room and waiting for the changes to start happening. Much to his surprise, it didn’t take long.<br />
<br />
Trevor lifted his hand up and looked at it when he felt an odd tingling sensation searing over his fingertips. His eyes went wide when he realized his fingers were growing freakishly long, except for his thumb, which seemed to be pulling back into his arm with an unsavory grinding noise.<br />
<br />
Trevor winced at the sight, but still didn’t feel any pain.<br />
<br />
As his fingertips continued to change into wingtips, Trevor felt an odd bristling sensation racing over his body. Glancing down at his chest, he let out an astonished gasp as his red chest hair started withering away as a plethora of short prongs started to bud out over his skin. Trevor let out another gasp when he realized the prongs were emerging on his arms, legs, neck, and were coming in much longer across his rear end, too. The only place they weren’t growing was the area just under his ankles.<br />
<br />
Down there, he watched on in shock as the pigment of the skin on his feet changed form a soft pink to a deep yellow. His toes seemed to be compressing into his foot, too. Before long, his five toes started merging into three digits, with a fourth poking out of his heel. The toenails turned black as soon as they fused together and Trevor winced again as the nails grew to insane lengths and curved inward, leaving him with a set of firesome eagle talons and claws just as his feet starting scaling out, too.<br />
<br />
Jerking his head back up, Trevor’s attention was drawn back to his arms and his chest as dark brown feathers started forming along all the prongs that had burst out of his body earlier. Even though he couldn’t see it, the feathers along the back of his neck were becoming a prominent gold color.<br />
<br />
By now his body was fully fledged and he lunged forward and held out his still incomplete wings as a jabbing sensation erupted from his backend. As his tail started forming to support his tail feathers, Trevor’s eyes went wide again. The room was actually getting bigger. He was shrinking!<br />
<br />
Letting out another nervous gasp that bordered on a whistle at this point, Trevor’s once impressive six-foot-four stature was reduced to a two-and-half-foot one. His eyes went wide again as another unnerving pressure build up in his head and his mouth as his teeth shifted into a beak and his head shoved out into a more aerodynamic design in one sleek push. <br />
<br />
A few seconds later, his eyesight changed and the odd feelings sweeping over his body subsided. The transformation was over.<br />
<br />
Twitching his head around in a very avian fashion, Trevor inspected his new vacation body that he’d won a lottery for. The sharp talons, the hooked beak, and the intense eyesight was everything he hoped it would be. Stretching out his wings, his beak hung open in bewilderment at both the feeling of the thick muscles that would help him fly and the shock that his arms had actually become wings. He truly had wings now!<br />
<br />
Shaking his head to get back to reality, Trevor stepped over to the button on the floor in front of him and hopped on top of it to get the door open. Overhead, the now gargantuan door slid open with a whirring hum and Trevor found Clark standing expectantly on the other side, the leather band in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Not bad,” he said approvingly. “I may have to try my luck at the lotto sometime, too. Okay, now just let me strap this band on to one of your talons and I’ll let you get on your way,” he added as he began to kneel down next to Trevor.</p>
