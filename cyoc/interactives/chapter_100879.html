<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff’s father looked to this program and was amazed by what it does.  A program that can actual change a person or thing into whatever he wants.  The possibilities are endless.  So much so, that he wanted to do something that he never do.  Not too long ago, John’s wife passed away after giving birth to their third child and daughter.  Since then, he was struggling to the keep the house intact and to with his low paying job, it wasn’t easy for a single father for three.  He just wishes that his wife would come back and that they would be a family again.  Maybe this Chronivac can help him bring her back.  Thinking about it, he decided to make this risk and bring her back.<br />
<br />
Turning to his son, he told him, “Hey Jeff?  Can you get down to living room to watch the game while a stay here for a moment?  There’s something I need to do here that is a bit private.”  Jeff looked to his father and was a little confused by his request.  Normally he wants to see what his father wants to do with the Chronivac and what it was.  Maybe he thought dad wanted to do something that was private.  After all, he was still having trouble finding someone to be his new wife and it was a struggle since then.  Shrugging his shoulders, he decided to leave him be.  “Alright…  Whatever you say dad.” He said to his father, “I need to go to the bathroom anyways before I head on down.  Just don’t take too long.”  He soon walked away from his computer and left his room, leaving his father alone in his son room.<br />
<br />
Seeing Jeff gone, he smiled and decided to get to work on bringing his wife back.  “All right, you little computer program,” he said to it, “let’s see if you can bring back the dead.”  He started to skim through his options and looked for something that will bring his wife back.  Searching through his options, he didn’t see anything that would help him with his dead wife.  Curious, he wondered why he couldn’t find an option in bringing his wife back from the dead.  He noticed the terms and conditions page at the bottom and decided to read through the rules and regulations.  Reading through what to do, John saw something interesting and it read…<br />
<br />
‘Attention…<br />
<br />
The Chronivac isn’t responsible for bringing people back from the dead.  Failing to follow that rule would result in the start of a Zombie Apocalypse or the diseased contemplating if he/she is alive or not.  So please, do not bring people back from the dead or the consequences would be dire.’<br />
<br />
John scratched his head and soon realizes that the idea of bringing his wife from the dead would be a very bad idea.  “Maybe there’s an alternative to bring my wife back.” he said as he looked through the packages.  Then he spotted one that got his interest.  It was called the Person Package and clicked on it, just to see what it means.  From the directions, it said…<br />
<br />
‘Welcome to the Person Package!  In this package, you can change one person in a whole different person, including that of the deceased.  It can be anyone you wanted, be that a regular person, a celebrity, or a family member of your choosing.  You can even change the person gender if you will.<br />
<br />
The process is simple.  First, type down the name of the person you want to change.  Then select the name of the person the target would change into.  You then have the option and alter the targets mind, reality, and awareness.  As an added bonus, there is a choice if you want to revert the target back to his/her original form, or leave the target’s change permanent.  Just remember, whatever choice you make will alter the target’s faith.  Have a nice day and thank you for choosing the Chronivac 4.0!’<br />
<br />
John read the message and was amazed by it.  A package that can turn anyone into his wife?  That sounds like a great idea!  If he can change any person into his wife, it would be a miracle for him.  The problem is, who will become the one he loved.  There are a lot of people he would choose from, even if it means removing their lives entirely.  People like his boss, his friends, and all the women that turned him down.  But the more he thinks about it, the more how difficult it will be to choose one of those people.  Still, of all the people he would want to change, there is one that got him thinking.<br />
<br />
His son…<br />
<br />
Ever since his mother passed on, Jeff was very devastated by the lose giving he loved her the most.  Sure he moved on, but her death still lingered in him for some time.  There were times that he felt sorry for his dad in loosing her as well.  One time, he heard his son said that he wish he was his mother, so that his father won’t feel abandoned.  Hearing him say that, John decided whom he wants to change.  “Jeff would make a great replacement for my wife.” he said to himself, “After all, he did say that he wanted to be his mother.  Looking towards the screen, he started to work on changing his own son into his wife.<br />
<br />
The first thing he started with is two text boxes asking the name of the person John wants to change and the name of another person the target would be.  Seeing this, typed down Jeff’s name at the top followed by his wife’s name, who’s name was Amanda.  Next to the name the target would change into is a drop down list of if the person is alive or deceased.  Seeing this, he chooses deceased as she passed away years ago.  At the bottom of the names were yes and no options to help him decided on what to do with Jeff.<br />
<br />
The first one is clothing change, as in if John would want to change his son’s clothes into that of his wife.  Giving that he doesn’t want his son outgrow his clothes, he selected yes.  The next option was if he wants to mentally change Jeff into that of his wife.  Knowing that having a wife thinking and acting like a teenage boy, he selected yes so Jeff look and think like Amanda.  Next one is reality change, where everyone would think that his wife is still alive and that Jeff would cease to exist.  This part he thought long and hard, as John had to figure out about reality.  As much as he wants his wife back, family and friends would be asking questions of what had happened to Jeff.  Giving that he doesn’t want that to happen, he immediately choose yes as a way to make sure that don’t ask those questions.  Next is the awareness option, which leaves the target aware of the changes happening to him.  John thought is would be funny for his son looking and himself changing.  But then, he started to have second thought as if Jeff saw himself changing, could mean that he’ll freak out, demanding what happened and that the Chronivac and his father is involved.  Knowing of the consequences, he chooses yes on that one as well, so Jeff won’t suspect a thing.  Then there was the awareness of the person using the Chronivac.  This time, there were three options of making John aware of the changes as well.  The first one is yes and the last one is no.  But the one in the middle says, ‘50/50’.  What it meant is that the host on this computer would be 50% aware that the target was the previous person while the other half is aware that it’s newly created person.  John was at the crossroads with this option as that would mean that he had three decisions to make.  But which is the question.  Giving it a serious thought, he knew what to decide on.  Moving the mouse, he chooses the 50/50 option.  That we he knows that the person he’s changing is still his son, but also his wife as well.<br />
<br />
Once all the yes and no questions were done with, John went to the next section of the page, the duration.  The top was the duration of Jeff changing into John’s wife; the one at the bottom was how long the change would last.  John looked to this and was interested to see what it can do.  Looking to the duration of the transformation, there was a small box that lets you type the number while next to it is a drop down list of whether it be seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years.  He thought about it long and hard, as he needed to know how to make the changes work.  But then, there&#39;s an alternate option to let the program know how the duration would change in a different way.  Seeing this, he remembered that he and Jeff were planning to watch a football game together.  It was then that an idea came to his head.  Clicking on the text box, he wrote this…<br />
<br />
‘The duration of my son turning into my wife will start when the football game for today will begin.  Once the game started, where will be fifteen-minute intervals for each play?  If each round ends or there’s a stop on the timer on foul play or flags, the changes will cease and will remain that way until the games starts back up again.  Once the game is finished, Jeff will be completely turned into my wife.’<br />
<br />
Once he finished typing this alternate duration, he moved on to the last option of page.  This last option is how long with the change last.  It does have a number box with the same drop down menu as before.  But there was another option below it that said ‘permanent’, as in the target will remain as this new person forever.  This is a very sticky one for him as he loved his wife for a long time, but doesn’t want to loose her for a short period of time.  But at the same time, he doesn’t want Jeff to be long forgotten as well and would never be brought back.  Still, Jeff did say that he wanted to be his mom for the rest of his life.  Right?  Maybe it’s best for both of them.  Taking that huge risk, he decided to select permanent into his option, leaving Jeff John’s wife for all eternity.<br />
<br />
With all of that finished, he skimmed the page again to see what he was missing.  Looking through his options again, John was satisfied with his decisions and was ready to begin changing his son into the wife he lost.  Going down, he clicked ‘Begin Transformation’ and was ready for this.  Just then, a window popped up as it says, ‘Warning: By choosing these options, the target will remain the person he/she changes forever.  Do you want to continue?’  John looks to this and thought it wanted him to cancel the changes before it could actually happens.  Mostly a warning of what would happen.  But giving what it told him, he’s still willing to do this.  After all, he missed his wife so much and he’s not going to stop what he’s doing.  Clicking on the ‘Yes’ icon, a new page opened up and said, ‘Thank you for using the Chronivac.  We hope you enjoy your new changes.’  Satisfied, he got off the computer and headed down to the living room to meet up with his son, and future wife.<br />
<br />
Back downstairs, Jeff was waiting patiently for dad in the living room and was getting a little nervous.  “What’s taking dad so long?” he asked himself, “I know I had to show him the program, but it wouldn’t let him take his time.  The game is going to start soon.  Wonder what he wanted to do with the program that is so private.  Maybe it’s something so dirty that he doesn’t want to tell me.  That’s grownups for you.  Always like to keep things to themselves.”<br />
<br />
Just as he was waiting, he heard a familiar voice from nearby.  “Waited for me, son?”  He turned around and saw his father, looking very calm.  Jeff crossed his arms and said, “Took you long enough.  What did you do with the program?  What have you decided?  Is it something private?”<br />
<br />
John looked to his son and knew he wanted an answer.  He doesn’t want Jeff to know what he did.  If he found out that John used his program to turn him into his wife, then he would be upset.  So he did the one thing he would never do.  Lie.  “Oh, it’s nothing to important.” he said, “It’s just something secretive that I can’t explain.”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to him with a sly smile and said, “I knew it!  I knew it!  You are too embarrassed in what you are going to say.  What did you do?  Something dirty?  Pornographic?  Come on, details!”<br />
<br />
John still shrugged it off and told him it was nothing.  “Nothing for you to worry about.” he said to his son, “It’s a little surprise.”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled his eyes around and could tell that he’s not spilling.  Signing, he said, “Right…  Whatever you say, dad.  Now come on, the game is about to start.”<br />
<br />
John nodded as he joined his son in the game.  Both of them sat on the sofa and were waiting for kickoff to start.  As they were sitting, John looked to his son to see him one last time before the changes start.  He looked fair for a sixteen-year-old boy.  His body type of light build as teenage muscles were evident on his arms and he usually saw him in his room and he looked into his mirror to show his physic after starting to work out in high school.  There was evidence that wisps of hair were growing on his body from his arms and legs to his chest and armpits.  His face was also looking like that of a teenage as he with stubble on his chin and a few pimples on his face, yet he covers them up nicely.  His black hair was short but messy while his brown eyes were rugged.  His clothing is that of a teenager as he was wearing a black T-shirt with a title that says ‘Keep Calm, Be a Teen 4Life’ over a leather jacket he likes to wear most of the time.  Long faded blue jeans that go down his knees, and a pair of Nike running shoes with white socks.  Looking to his son, John knows that this will be the last time he would see him.  But it’s for the best as he gets his wife back by removing his son from all existence.<br />
<br />
Jeff soon turned to his father and noticed that he’s starring at him strangely.  Cocking an eyebrow, he asked, “Dad?  Why are you looking at me like that?”<br />
<br />
John blinked and soon realized that his son was getting suspicious.  Turning his head away, he answered, “Oh!  It’s nothing, son.  I was just…”  He started to think of a really good excuse and decided on something interesting to ask.  “Can I ask you something?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to him strangely and answered, “Sure thing dad.  What is it?”<br />
<br />
Dad got his head down and he said to his son, “Did you miss you mom?”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that and couldn’t believe that his father asked that type of question.  Sure that he loved his mother and was a role model to him.  But when she died, it’s like a hole was formed in his heart and he was upset about it.  Sure he recovered from that lose, but the grief is still deep in his soul.  It still hurts him ever since.  Looking to his father, he answered, “Of course I miss her dad.  I always looked up to her ever since I was young.  When she left us, it burned a hole through my heart that will never heal.  Sometimes, I wish I would do anything to bring her back.”<br />
<br />
“Even if it means trading your life for that of your mother’s?” John asked his son, when he heard his son that he’ll do anything to bring his wife back.<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, as he could believe his father asked of that.  But the more he heard it, the more he put some thought to it.  See, deep down inside himself, there was this one little secret he kept to himself.  He never told anyone about it, especially his own father.  But when he asked that question, a part of him wanted to say it.  So deciding on letting it all out, he turned to his dad and said, “Actually, there is one little secret I’ve been keeping to myself.”<br />
<br />
“Oh really?” John asked his son, “And what secret is that?”<br />
<br />
Jeff took a deep breath and decided to let it all out.  “Promise never to tell anybody?” he asked before spilling his secret, “Well, to be honest, I wanted to be just like my mom.  I mean, I know it sounds silly, but mom was everything to me.  She was sweet, she’s caring, she took care of us, and she loved us.  She always makes sure that the house is intact and she cooked the best meals.  And as much as I admit it, I pick up where she left off, keeping the house neat and food prepared while getting through with high school.  So if I’m willing to give up my own life so that mom could live again, then so be it.”<br />
<br />
John listened to his son and was amazed of what he heard.  That his son, his own flesh and blood, wanted to trade his own life so his own mother would be brought back from the dead.  It seems that using the program to turn Jeff into that said mother was the wisest thing he had done.  Hearing that, he rubbed Jeff’s head and said, “You’re a good boy, Jeff.  Your mom would be so proud of you.”  Jeff just smiled and chuckled, knowing that her mother is happy that he’s following in her footsteps.<br />
<br />
As soon as the moment is over, the game started as the two sat back on the couch to watch football match.  Just as soon as the whistle billowed and the first kick started, Jeff felt a chill in his body as it traveled from head to toe.  Feeling that, he was curious as to why he started to feel cold.  But then, he brushed it off as he thought it was the air conditioning.  As he went back to watching the game, John looks to his son and knew that the changes are starting.  Once the game is over, Jeff will transform into his wife, Amanda.<br />
<br />
Watching the game, everything was going smoothly until the next minute where there was a temporary foul.  Seeing this as a good opportunity, John looked back to his son to see the first signs of the changes.  So far, he didn’t see anything much, being that it’s a start of the changes, but there were some slight differences.  For example, Jeff looked a little taller, almost a few inches.  His hair almost looked a little more unkempt as you could’ve sworn it was a tad longer then before.  Plus his clothes looked the same with the exception of his pants and shirt as the bottom hem rose a little higher, but to you, it was just your imagination.  Regardless, this is the start of the transformation as you went back to the TV as the game came back to playing.<br />
<br />
It’s already been four minutes as the play continued with both teams.  Everything from passes, the fumbles, to one team moving after another as they went from one quarter to another.  Both John and Jeff watched on in excitement as the intensity continued to escalate.  Yet that’s not the only thing that is escalating.  For Jeff was squirming for a little bit and doesn’t have a clue why he was having a hard time getting comfortable on the sofa.  Of course, it has something to do with the fact that he was still changing in a slow, but steady pace.  Yet he didn’t notice any of it, as he was too engrossed to the game.  Even if he does notice, the Chronivac made it so that he won’t even be aware of the changes happening to him.<br />
<br />
As soon as the next foul and commercial break happened, John turned to his son and could tell that the changes were subtle.  He grew a little taller as he was already around the five-foot mark and his body was starting to gain definition.  But it wasn’t anything that was manly; it was more of a feminine touch.  The muscles he was starting to gain when he was working out at high school was slowly deteriorating in some places and gaining in others.  He could see the sparse hair on his arms growing fainter as the skin was looking a little smoother.  The hair on his head grew a little longer as it went down his upper neck and it looks like it was straightening a little bit, looking less messy then before.  He even notice that his face a little bit different then before.  He couldn’t put his finger on it, but it looks like the skin of his face was looking a bit smoother as the few pimples slowly shrink into his skin while the stubble on his face was looking less noticeable.  The clothes also looked different as well.  It almost looks like part of those clothes were shrinking with him while his body was changing.  The sleeves of his jacket looked like they were above his wrists then on top of it, the hem of his pants rose a little higher as it was showing off his socks, and he could see a bit of his stomach exposed as the bottom hem of his shirt rose a little more while the top was lowering to expose a bit of his skin on his chest.  It was a bit surreal as if the clothes are slowly altering along with his body.  Of course he choose that option to alter Jeff’s clothes, otherwise his newly created wife would be dressed up as a teenage.  Regardless, it seems like the changes are working along quite nicely.  He can only imagine what the rest of the change is going to be like.<br />
<br />
The play continued on as the both teams scuffle for a point.  After another four minutes, the one team scored a touchdown followed by a punt point and the cheered for that team.  Jeff fist pumped into the air as he turned to dad and pointed to the game on the TV.  “Did you see that dad?” he asked him, “Did you see that play they did?  That was awesome!”  John turned to his son and was happy about it too.  But then, he was happy about the changes continuing on his son.  <br />
<br />
It seems that he stopped growing taller, but he could see the proportions of his body changing a bit more.  He noticed his hips increasing by a few centimeters as his boyish hips started to expand.  Though he couldn’t see it, his rear began to inflate like that of a balloon as his but looked a little bit puffy.  His face was clearing up a bit more as the stubble is far less sparse and the pimples almost looked none existent.  Even his hair looked far straighter and was creeping down his neck.  The sleeves, bottom pant legs, and the top and bottom part of his clothes kept rising and lowering, exposing more skin.  Seeing the progression of the change, he smiled and said without letting him know of the changes, “Indeed, that was awesome.”<br />
<br />
When the commercial was over with, the two went back to watching and saw the two teams struggling for the next point.  It was a long five minutes with the battle getting fiercer.  After that, the enemy team scored the same touchdown and goal point.  Both John and Jeff felt defeated as Jeff screamed, “Boo!  That’s bullshit!  Not way that team can pull something like that off.  This blows!”  John turned to his son and told him, “Don’t worry Jeff, the game will get better.”  Though he mentioned it, he was actually saying that Jeff would get better during his transition to his mother.<br />
<br />
Once the minute ran down, Jeff was already 25% changed and the look was evidential.  He was taller, but stopped around five feet as if he aged four to five years of age.  But instead of him aging to a man, he changing into that of a woman.  He was skinny, but skinny is what he should be when he turned into a woman.  Still, he was gaining fat in some places.  His hips widened a little bit and his rear looked a little rounded.  Tone is starting to show on his arms, but it was more of a feminine persuasion.  The sparse hair on those arms were very faint, that it was difficult to tell that it was there.  His face was completely clear as there were no pimples or stubble anywhere on his face while his skin was less rugged and smoother.  The hair on his head grew downwards to his neck and was strait with no strands sticking out.  His clothes shifted a little more and as more skin started to get exposed on the arms, legs, stomach, and upper chest.  So far, he was getting changed more and more as he was slowly, but surely turning into the very wife John lost.<br />
<br />
“Man, this game is already tight.” Jeff said, as his voice was a bit higher, but remained his old voice, “I can imagine what the rest of the game is going to be like.”  John cocked his eyebrow and would see the changes have become more evident then before.  “Trust me when I say it Jeff, it will get better when this games escalates.”  What he meant was that as time continues to go forward that Jeff will keep on changing more and more into his own wife.<br />
<br />
When the commercial was over, the 2nd round of the football game started, as the two teams were aggressive with each other.  The play was rough and tough and it lasted for six minutes straight.  But when there was an illegal play in the field, the first flag was on the ground, as it will take some time on what the penalty will be.  When that took place, John had the time to take a look at his son to see the changes happening more and more.<br />
<br />
Jeff had already aged to over a year and had entered his young adult stages.  But the changes were that of a male, but changing to that of a female.  What was supposed to be fat in some place, it was in others while his hips and read kept on expanding and starting to show a slight curve to the sides of his stomach.  His arms and legs kept getting toned and were showing off his female qualities in them.  But the hair on his arms was very faint as they almost disappeared.  His face left the childish like qualities as he entered his adult years, but the transcendence was becoming womanly when that of manly.  The nose was starting to get thinner and lips were starting to blow up and showing the skin of the lips looking a bit puffy.  The hair kept on growing downwards through the neckline and it was in the middle of the neck while it was very clean and straight.  The sleeves, bottoms, and top and bottom part of his shirt kept rising and lowering as skin was showing off on the arms, legs, stomach, and upper chest.  So far, the changes kept on slowing, but it was very steadily.<br />
<br />
The penalty was soon made, the game continued as the two kept on watching.  For the next five minutes, the team the two was rooting for was able to get another touchdown and the punt point, putting them in the lead.  Jeff stood up and cheered for them, saying, “Yeah!  That’s what I’m talking about!  Another win for us!”  As he got up, John got a good look on his backside and was surprised to see and round his rear is, but the rest of his body had gone through more changes as well.<br />
<br />
His body was aging and was another year down.  His hips kept on widening and curving around.  His back was arched back and it started to show a really good shape.  The legs and arms started to pump in more fat and kept on toning up to give him quick a good looking man switching to a woman.  As he was enjoying the game, he felt something strange in his groin and rubbed it a little bit privately.  He doesn’t know what.  But what it was is that his own penis was tingling and shriveling in a slow pace, meaning that he will actually start to real change into a woman.  Sure it would be slow, but it will be enjoyable for John to watch.  His face kept on changing further to womanhood with his nose thinning and lips inflating.  Slow indeed, but really good to witness.  Hair kept on growing downwards and creeping further down to his lower neck.  But then, the hair strands looked different.  They started to lightened it was a dark red color.  John knew what it meant.  For he remembers that his wife use to have red hair in the day.  To see that hair showing on his son, he starting to see his wife out of him.  The clothing kept shrinking on the sleeves, pants, and shirt and more skin was showing.  Jeff really was showing signs of his own mother and he didn’t notice any of it.  John can’t wait to see what other changes were taking place.<br />
<br />
Jeff soon sat down and silently rubbed his nether regions with discomfort.  “Whoa…  What is wrong with me?” he asked himself, “I feels like my privates are on fire.”  John looked to him and could tell that his dick was starting to shift around.  “I don’t know, maybe it’s puberty.  You are a growing boy after all.” he said with a white lie.  “But this is more intense then I remembered.” Jeff said with a bit a crack in his voice, “It’s almost like my insides are rearranging.  I just hope I’m not coming down with something.”  John could see the Jeff was getting a slight discomfort and could tell that the changes in his privates are the worse part.  Perhaps the problem would pass once the changes will be in near completion.  At least he’s glad that he set the aware on for Jeff, otherwise, things could get suspicious for him.<br />
<br />
Jeff soon enough took a seat as the game came back on and the two teams battle for control of the football.  The play was rough as the enemy team pushed through with all they have.  However, the other team had some strong defense and kept them from getting to goal on the other end.  After two minutes and multiple stops, it was the fourth round and the enemy couldn’t get a touchdown.  However, they did manage to make a punt goal as they got three points.  The two watched on and sighed in relief that there wasn’t a tie in the game.  “That was close.” John said, “For a second there, I thought that this game is going to be an even stalemate.”  “Don’t count on it yet, dad.  This is near the end of the 2nd quarter and there are a two more to compete in.” Jeff said that as his voice started to get squeaky he sounded half the boy he is and half the wife he’s going to be.  John looked to him and notice that his son’s changes were escalating.<br />
<br />
The years kept piling on him as he was going though his twenties in an alarming rate.  His body though was shifting around and was feeling more and more female and less and less male.  He soon notices that his chest started a look a little puffy.  It’s as if his nipples were beginning to poke out under his chest.  John’s guess is that he’s starting to grow breasts and they were slowly inflating.  It will take some time, but when the game is over, the breasts will be fully grown and will look like what his deceased wife had.  That doesn’t mean that the breasts won’t be the only things that will change.  His hips kept on growing in a steady rate and kept on getting curvier then before.  At the same time, his rear was ballooning and rounding to that of a female shape.  His arms and legs fattened and toned up and were getting very shapely.  His face continued to change more and more with his nose thinned to the point that it has female proportions and his lips inflating to that of womanly qualities.  And his hair kept growing downwards still and more red strands slowly appeared on his head.  The clothing kept on shifting while the sleeves, bottom of the pants, and the upper and bottom hem of his shirt kept on shrinking and showing off more skin.  But that’s not the only thing.  For when the pants grew up, his white socks grew upwards and joined in on the changes.  John looked on with anticipation and could really see his wife next to him.  However, it was still a long ways to go, as Jeff was still present.  But when the game is over, Amanda will take his place.  And that’s one thing he wants to see.<br />
<br />
After another rough fight, the game was soon over and the home team was taking the lead.  “That was intense!” Jeff said with a higher voice, but remained masculine, “I can’t wait to see what the second half is going to be like.”  He soon stood up and decided to leave for the kitchen to whip something up.  “I’m going to get something to eat.  I really need to get to walk off the pain in my privates.”  He soon turned to his dad and asked, “You want something too?”  John turned to his son and could already see he’s half man and half woman.<br />
<br />
He aged five more years and in his mid twenties, but his body is so much womanly then before.  He could see the his chest slowly growing out of his chest and his hips and rear kept on shifting and widening to make his side with more curves and a really good shape.  His arms and legs remained the same and had the tone and shape of a woman.  John even notices his son’s hands changing, shrinking and becoming a little daintier then before.  His fingers grew long and thin and as his nails slowly grew out and was a little longer.  He kept on feeling his dick shrinking in his pants as his balls slowly shriveled away.  Then his face kept on shifting and Jeff looked more like the wife at her young age then his son Jeff.  His nose was thin and lips look very puffy and kissable.  His hair continues to grow downwards and more red took over his black tresses.  The sleeves, bottom of his pants, and the top and bottom of his shirt kept on shrinking more and more to continue to show off more skin.  But then, then other changes took place on his clothes.<br />
<br />
His leather black jacket had pockets on the sides and a logo of the home football team on the back.  John could see that the pockets were slowing getting smaller and fainter while the bottom of his jacket grew down a little.  The shirt he was wearing remained the same, but the title on the front looked fainter and darker.  His blue jeans started to get darker and as the pockets slowly sealed themselves up and the belt getting thinner.  His socks kept on growing up his legs and they too kept on getting darker as well, but in a different color, almost lightish brown.  And his sneakers started to change with designs slowly peeling back, his lasses starting to untie itself and shrinking, and the rubber heel on the back slowly starting to rise.  By the way he was looking, it’s almost like his clothes were starting shift into something completely different.<br />
<br />
Looking to his soon to be changed wife, he smiles and said, “Whatever you’re going to make, and it’s all right for me.  Just be back before the third quarter starts.  Jeff nodded as he slowly started to walk straight to the kitchen.  John kept on watching as he saw Jeff starting to sway his hips like that of a woman.  John smirked a little and didn’t think his son would behave like that.  But then, he wasn’t looking like his son anymore.  He was more like that of his wife, Amanda.  In face, his mind was starting to get foggy as his memories were being rearranged.  He could see the pictures of his son fading away while the face of his wife was resurfacing, complete with new memories.  He knew that he could feel the mental changes in his head kicking in and he knew that reality is starting to change as well.  Looking to the picture on the lamp stand, he could see his son on the group photo of his family slowly obscuring while the image of his wife slowly reappearing.  Thankfully, he was aware of the changes, as the rest of the world isn’t.  Otherwise, he would still remember his son turning into his wife.  Now all he has to do is sit back and wait for Jeff, or Amanda, come back with a snack.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back in the kitchen, Jeff was preparing something quick for he and his father would eat.  So far, all he thought of that was a quick one are two sandwiches, some chips, and something to drink.  “I hope dad like these sandwiches I’m making.” He said with a chirpier sound of his voice, “It’s not enough, but it will do for a game type of meal.  Still…  Something’s not right about my dad.  He’s been looking at me strangely for a lot of bizarre reason.  Wonder why?”  He thought long and hard and didn’t have the slightest clue as to why his father was acting so weird.<br />
<br />
As he was thinking of it, he vaguely remembers his father using the Chronivac for something as he left him in his room.  He wondered what it was?  Brushing it aside, he said, “Guess I have to ask him about it.  After all, John is my fath-  er-  I mean husband.  I’ll speak to him about it.”  As he spoke, he made those types of corrections, as he was about to say his father.  But then, he started to think that John was his husband.  This is because his mind was altering to make him think he, or she, is the wife of John instead of a son.  It made the most obvious of sense.  Right?  Still, he/she brushed it aside and headed down the fridge to get some drinks.<br />
<br />
Looking through his options, he/she spotted a beer bottle in the fridge for his dad/her husband.  He/she took it out and placed it on the tray with his meal.  Jeff then went to get a coke, but something in his/her mind changed.  It felt like he/she needed something else to drink with his father, her husband, and a can of coke felt too young for him/her.  Closing the fridge, he/she looked around the kitchen and opened the pantry to find something else.  That’s when he/she spotted wine bottles, the type he/she likes.  Taking the bottle out, he/she went to the cabinet and opened it up to get a glass from there.  Pouring the wine in, he/she placed the new glass in his/her tray.  Picking the two trays up, he/she left the kitchen to meet up with his dad/her husband.<br />
<br />
Back to John, he was watching the half time show ending and the 3rd quarter was about to start.  Tapping his fingers, he knew the Jeff/Amanda was taking his/her time.  His guess is that maybe he/she is cooking something special for him.  Perhaps something that would be memorable.  Still a part of him thinks that it could be wrong at what he was doing.  Turning his own son into his deceased wife?  That seems completely off.  But a part of him really wants to see his wife again and wanted to do whatever it takes to bring her back.  Plus his son really wanted to be his own mother and would do anything to make it work.  So if he wanted to bring his wife back by taking away the son, so be it.<br />
<br />
“Here you go, sweetie.”<br />
<br />
John soon heard that turned to see his son/wife carrying two trays of sandwiches.  One had a beer; the other is a glass of wine.  John looked to him/her and was amazed by how he/she looked right now.  “Wow Jeff?” he said with astonishment, “You look good.”  Jeff simply smirked and said, “Oh John, you say the sweetest thing.”  He/she soon placed John’s tray on his side of the table while he/she place his/her own on his/her side.  He/she then to a seat next to his father/her husband, and started to sip his/her wine.  John looks to his son/his wife and was very curious.  “Since when did you drink wine?”  Jeff/Amanda looked to him with a smile and said, “What are you talking about sweetie.  I always like to drink wine.  You have you forgotten about that?”  John looked to him/her strangely and gave it some thought.  He remembered his wife having a glass of wine for relaxed occasions.  But this wasn’t his wife, it was his son.  His son would never drink any alcohol.  However, his son was changing and aging into his wife, so it seems fine for him/her to drink that wine.  Shrugging it off, he said, “But of course.  How could I forget that?”  He soon got back to the TV as he and his son/wife watch on as the third quarter starts.<br />
<br />
Already, the game was getting extremely intense, as both players have been battling over the next win.  The tumbles, the tackles, and long and short runs, the two teams are giving it all their own.  It only took seven minutes until the touchdown and goal point came from the home team.  Both John and Jeff/Amanda cheered for their team, as they felt so proud of who won.  “Yet another victory for our team!” Jeff/Amanda said with an even higher voice, “They were phenomenal!”  John turned to his soon to be wife and could see the changes kept on escalating.<br />
<br />
So far, he/she was nearing thirty years of age as while her body didn’t grow, it matured.  His/her chest kept growing as they start to grow to a pair of As to Bs.  Not much, but it will steadily grow as time progresses.  His/her hips expanded further away and the rear grew round and bubbly, giving him/her much slender curves around his/her stomach and sides.  Muscles were tones and shapely, but they were beginning to show signs of age.  His/her hands were more slender and dainty while the fingers and fingernails were growing a bit longer then before.  Jeff/Amanda started to feel a bit uncomfortable as he/she adjusted himself/herself on the sofa.  Of course, that’s because his/her privates were slowly rearranging themselves as his/her dick slowly grew smaller and his/her ball sack saw shriveling bit by bit.  His/her face kept on molding on with now kissable lips, thin nose, and elegant eyes.  Of course, the sign of age was starting to show there as well as while the skin was smooth, was beginning to show the signs of faint lines around his/her eyes and mouth.  Still, he/she looked as beautiful as ever.  His/her hair started to grow further down his/her neck and was starting to reach his/her back while his/her hair gained more red then his/her natural black color.  On hindsight, he/she looks less like Jeff and more like Amanda.<br />
<br />
The clothes on him/her kept on changing and altering bit by bit into what looks like a different set of clothing.  The sleeves grew upwards to expose more of his/her clear skin while the bottom of the jacket grew a little longer.  John could also see that the opened part of the jacket were drawing closer together for some bizarre reason.  The pockets started to get smaller and fainter as they were nearly none existent.  The top and bottom hems of his/her shirt kept growing upwards and downwards to reveal more skin while the Keep Calm was fading further and further into the black color.  The bottom of his/her pants kept on rising upwards, revealing more and more smooth and shapely legs as they kept on darkening.  The pockets kept on getting fainter and fainter, making it look like it was vanishing away while the belt kept getting thinner.  His/her socks continued to grow up to where the pants bottoms were rising as kept on darkening to a bronze like cooler as the texture change to something more smooth on his/her legs.  And the sneakers continued to shift with the designs moving away, the lasses shrinking, and the heel slowly rising up.  John couldn’t put his finger on it, but it looks like that Jeff’s/Amanda’s clothes were changing into something women would wear.  What, he doesn’t know.  But he hopes that when the changes are finished, then maybe he will get a chance in seeing the end results.<br />
<br />
The game continued on as the two teams were taking control of the ball with whatever offense and defense they can carry.  During the game, Jeff/Amanda slowly stood up straight and picked up his/her wine glass, getting less excited about the game.  “Tell me John,” he/she started to ask, “What do you see in this game?”  John turned to his son/wife and noticed that he/she was getting bored by it.  Shrugging it off as nothing, he said to him/her, “Well, the intensity is one thing.  The other is competition.  Why did you ask that type of question?  I thought you like Football.”  “No,” was Jeff’s/Amanda’s answer.  “I only watch this game because you let me.  You know I don’t have time for mindless men running back and forth to get a few points.  I should be watching a soap opera by now then this testosterom filled game.”  John listened to that and could tell that Jeff’s/Amanda’s attitude has changed.  A few seconds ago, the son called Jeff always love to watch his home team play a game and root for them.  But the Amanda’s side was bored by it as he remembered her not wanting to watch something so brutal.  It seems as if Amanda’s personality and slowly seeping into the body that was once Jeff.  Pretending that this is normal, John smirked and said, “Yet here you are, watching it with me.  Sometimes you got to get out of your comfort zone, love.”  Jeff/Amanda sighed and said back, “I guess I have no choice in the matter anyways.  There’s no soaps or talk shows on the weekends.  Might as well watch something else then do absolutely nothing at all.”  He/she then sipped his/her wine and kept watching the game with less intent.<br />
<br />
As he/she watched, John took another good look at Jeff/Amanda and could tell that more changes were very evident.  Aging a couple of more years, he/she already passed his/her thirties and kept maturing upwards through adulthood.  His/her breasts grew another cup size as they were now fully grown Cs and looked full and bouncy, showing off some serious cleavage on his/her changing shirt.  His/her hips kept on widening and curving to give out a well-defined hourglass while the rear kept growing to accommodate his/her shapely figure.  His/her arms and legs were getting toned and long, but age was showing as they started to look a little wrinkly, but not so much as to show his/her elderly side.  His/her hands kept thinning and getting dainty as his/her nails grew longer and almost looked like that there was polish slowly appearing.  He/she crossed his/her legs and squirmed a little bit.  What happened is that his/her privates changed more and more as his/her dick grew smaller and the balls underneath it kept shriveling and sinking away.  Jeff’s/Amanda’s face matured into a woman and much has changed.  However, there were signs of age as the laugh line deepened a little bit.  However, makeup was being applied to his/her face slowly with his/her lips getting a little redder and the blush appearing and spreading.  His/her hair kept one getting lower and redder as it spread down the shoulders and nearing the upper back.  Course age made the hair duller as a few more gray streaks appeared, but hidden well underneath the tresses.  John looked to Jeff’s/Amanda’s face and could tell that despite the age, he/she was getting more beautiful.  He wondered how much the changes were going to be.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s/Amanda’s clothes continued to alter and looked less like Jeff clothing he usually wears and more like what John’s wife wears.  The top and bottom hem of his/her shirt shrinking more and more and the ‘Keep Calm’ logo slowly darkened and disappearing, exposing more skin.  So much so is that John could see the nicely toned stomach and the cleavage of his/her exposed breasts that are still growing.  It also is clear that his/her continue aging is getting more evident with a bit of sag on his/her chest and there looks like stretch marks slowly appearing and looks a little bloated.  John’s guess is that it was the pregnancy that got to his wife.  Course, that’s the price for having kids.  Back to Jeff’s/Amanda’s clothes, there were other changes going on as well.  The sleeves of his/her jacket continued to rise higher and was not up his/her elbows.  The bottom of his/her jacket lowered a bit more as the opening that showed the shrinking shirt continues to draw much closer.  The pockets and the back football logo continued to shrink and fade in as the color was getting darker and looking a little bit elegant then before.  His/her pants grew upwards and was now up to his/her knees, looking like shorts then pants.  The pockets was nearly sealed completely and the belt thinning to a very small line around his/her waist.  The socks though grew upwards and was inching closer to the shrinking pants as they darkened a bit more and looked a little bit silky in the texture department.  The lasses of his/her were already long gone as the last remnants of it vanished out of thin air while the holes that the laces go through shrunk and disappeared as well.  The textures kept on shifting while the back heels kept growing and looked like an inch.  Not only that, but the sole of the sneakers started to go downwards and was exposing the top of his/her feet.  They almost look like a new set of shoes that are changing, almost something womanlier.<br />
<br />
Jeff/Amanda started to get bored and turned to his father/her husband with a confused look.  “Why are to starring at me like that hun?” he/she asked him, “Is there something on my face?”  John remained silent as he realized that he had been looking to his son/his wife for a long time.  Thinking up a really good excuse, he said, “Oh, it’s nothing sweetie.  It’s just that you look so beautiful as of late.”  Jeff/Amanda was taken back by that complement and turned away with a pleasing smile.  “Oh John,” he/she said it a high pitch in his/her voice, “You say the sweetest things.”  He/She went back to sipping his/her wine and eating his/her sandwich while watching the game.  John took a deep sigh and was glad he was able to get out of it.  He knows that his son/his wife is getting awfully suspicious on what he was doing.  He knows that the metal changes are happening so Jeff/Amanda won’t be curious, but he can’t let him/her know what’s really going on.  So to prevent further awkwardness, he decided to wait until the game is over and then see the results.  After all, the game is almost over and the fact remains that despite the timeouts and goal points, it was still going to be interesting to see the changes escalating further.<br />
<br />
As soon as the game started, the third quarter was over with and there is a bit of a break.  As soon as the commercial started, Jeff/Amanda’s changes were getting slightly different then before.  He/she aged a few more years and was now in his/her mid thirties as his/her body was showing signs of aging.  His/her breasts have grew up to D cups and shows a bit of sag while his/her stomach was a little pouched, but not so much to loose her curvy figure.  His/her arms and legs were showing a big of flab, but remained toned after his/her rigorous workout.  His/her hands were getting more feminine with thinner fingers and longer nails, which were showing signs of a red coloring appearing on each nail.  His/her face has more feminine attributes then that of the once teenage boy that was sitting on that sofa.  It showed almost everything that resembles that of a woman and was slowly shifting after every play.  Of course, age is playing a role as the faint lines around his/her eyes and mouth were deepening and his/her lengthening hair was dulling and showing a few more gray streaks.  Jeff/Amanda continued to squirm a little more while his/her genitals continued to change more and more.  With his/her penis shrinking more and more and his/her balls already absorbed into his/her skin and into the now opening folds, it’s obvious that he/she is leaving his/her manhood and was reaching womanhood.  <br />
<br />
The clothes he/she was wearing kept on altering more and more, making them feel more comforting then the previous attire.  The shirt was shrunk to the point that it looked more like some kind of bra while the remaining ‘Stay Calm’ logo vanished completely.  The shape soon rounded around the breasts and shifted the fabric around into something soft and comfortable.  Meanwhile, the bottom of the jacket grew downwards while the sleeves grew upwards to expose more skin.  The middle of his jacket kept on going closer and closer together as it was covering the skin exposed on the front and the shirt that’s shifting into that of a bra.  The pockets have already disappeared and the Football logo was nearly vanished while the color darkened more and more and was turning into a smooth like fabric.  His/her pants grew up higher and was above the knees and that too darkened to a dark blue color.  The pockets sealed themselves up completely as the belt itself vanished out of thin air, leaving the belt loops being the next to go and they were getting smaller and compressed.  Another thing is the button and zipper as they were next to fade away.  The socks continued to migrate upwards where the pants were rising and were already on the knees as they darkened more and more into a medium brown color and smoothing over.  And his sneakers continued to shift more and more.  The top sole kept on growing downwards more and more to reveal more of the skin of the feet.  The designs and textures get less noticeable as they were absorbing into the leather and darkening to look like a gray color.  His/her heel continued to grow more and more and was rising on well over an inch.  Of a deeper view, it looked like that his/her attire was becoming half a dress, but still Jeff’s old look.<br />
<br />
Jeff/Amanda looked to the end of the third quarter and wasn’t impressed by it.  It’s as if he/she was getting bored by it more and more and was wondering why he/she was there in the first place.  But there’s a reason why he/she was looking at this game.  John…  Turning to him, he was watching the TV and sipping on his beer, waiting for the fourth quarter to start.  Looking to him, with pleasing eyes, she would do anything to be with him.  Especially if that means watching one of his games.  But there’s a burning sensation under him/her and it wants him/her to do something more then watch a silly little game.  Finishing his/her dinner, he/she started to pick up the wine and took a final sip feeling more relaxed then before.<br />
<br />
As the forth quarter started, the play intensified as the two team were hitting hard.  As the plays went on, there was a flag on the field after the seven minutes.  As soon as that happened, Jeff’s/Amanda’s body remained the same only aging a little more.  Already reaching her forties, he/she was more like a cougar then a young woman.  Still, he/she looked really good for someone his/her age.  Everyone has changed on him/her as the last of his/her male self-faded away.  The only thing that needed to change was his/her privates as they were making the slow transition to those of female qualities.  His/her dick was already three inches as the balls that went into the open folds migrated inwards and shifted around.  Jeff/Amanda was getting uncomfortable and squirmed a little more on the sofa, feeling that bit of pain.  Flicking his/her redder and duller hair, which grew down to close to her back, he/she looked to his father/her husband for complete comfort.  That end, he/she placed his/her wine down and did a little skid to his side, wanting to make this lame night a little more passionate.<br />
<br />
The game went back on as the two teams started to get into their positions and played.  While that was going on, his/her body continued to change.  But it was now mostly focused on his/her clothes.  The shirt, he/she use to have on has now become a bra with a strap around his/her back, exposing some serious cleavage and a tone stomach that has a small little pouch.  But that will soon changed as the opening of the jacket started to draw closer together and nearly covered him/her up while the bottom hem grew downward.  The sleeves were already on his/her arms and was rising higher and higher to get to the top.  The pocket and the football logo on the back were already gone as there was nothing that represents it as a common sports jacket.  The here already up the thighs as the belt loops looked more like little dots then anything else.  The button on the top vanished and sank into the fabric while the zipper faded downwards and the fold sealed itself up.  As the pants bottom was at the thighs it started to slant upwards to the outer sides.  With the color darkening more black then blue, it seems like it was looking like another type of undergarment for women.  As that change was going on, the socks of his/her was extending past his/her knees and darkened more brownish while the texture looked a bit revealing.  At the same time, the sneakers were less like sneaker and more like women footwear for going out.  The top sole got deeper down and was halfway to the end as it merged with the rest of the leather around his/her feet.  The leather itself darkened to a deeper gray color and was smooth and shiny compared to the what they previously were.  And the heel grew a little more and became a two inches.<br />
<br />
As the changes kept going, Jeff/Amanda was getting closer to John as he/she had a strong need for something.  That something was burning on him/her since the changes were escalating.  The moment he/she was close enough, he/she wrapped his/her arm around his father’s/her husband’s neck and was acting a little coy.  John could feel that and tuned to see Jeff/Amanda resting his/her head on him.  That caught him by surprise, as he didn’t think it would go down to that.<br />
<br />
“Jeff?” he said to him/her in surprise, “What the hell?  What are you doing?”  Jeff/Amanda looked to him with deep eyes and asked in confusion, “Jeff?  Who’s Jeff?  You have me mistaken for someone else.  It’s me, Amanda.  Your loving wife.  Remember?”  John blinked and realized what he, now a she meant.  With Jeff nearly fading to existence, it was a matter of time before he had to pronounce her as Amanda instead of Jeff.  In fact, looking at her, he didn’t see any resemblance of Jeff anywhere, only the woman he lost before.<br />
<br />
Next to him was the woman around her forties with a fit body what was showing her age.  She had huge breasts, a slim hourglass figure, toned up arms and legs, and a beautiful face with make up already applied on.  And although he didn’t see it, but her privates were nearly completed as the penis grew smaller and thinner while the mushroom head compressed into a colitis while the balls turned into ovaries on the inside.  The clothes were the most drastic yet.  He could see the bra that was once a shirt completely visible until the opening started to close up as the zipper slowly zipped itself up to close it off.  The sleeves were midway through the biceps and the color got darker as it looked completely black.  The pants grew shorter and shifting into a pair of panties.  But you cannot see it as the bottom hem grew downwards to cover it up completely.  The socks though grew longer as they were darkening to a brown like color and it was completely see through.  And the shoes look darker as the sole was inching closer to the end of the front and the heel grew two and a half inches.  It does seem like Jeff was no more and in her place of John’s wife.<br />
<br />
John gulped a little and was a little cautious about her behavior.  “Now Je-“ he said before correcting himself, “I mean Amanda, let’s not get too hasty.  It’s still early and the game is going on.  Can we just simply wait until it’s over?”  Amanda though wasn’t buying it as she decided to make her move.  “Why wait until this silly little game is over when we can have our own playoff here?” she asked before turning to him, ready to pounce.  “Come here, lover boy!”<br />
<br />
She then immediate tackled him on the sofa and pinned him completely.  John looked on in surprise and couldn’t believe that his once son, now wife could be this aggressive.  He struggled to get out, but it was completely impossible.  Amanda starred him down with sultry eyes and decided to seal the deal, by planting a warm kiss on his lips.  John had wide eyes as he was going to get out of this.  But the moment she kissed, he soon relaxed and felt tempted in keeping it going.  Closing his eyes, he accepted the kiss and responded with a deeper kiss, remember how much he missed this moment.  They soon embraced each other and were groping each other while the game played.<br />
<br />
As the game continued on, the last of Amanda’s changes happened as the clothes finished shifting around.  Jeff’s shirt turned into Amanda’s bra as the jacked sealed itself up completely with the zipper zipping up to the top to cover her up before fading and merging with the cloth.  The sleeves went all the way up to the shoulders and opened itself up to expose the top skin and showing off her boobs.  Soon enough, what were left of the sleeves were tiny straps that are wrapped around her arms.  The lower hem grew downwards until it stopped down to her knees.  And what’s left of the team logo vanished as the color went completely black and the texture was silky smooth.  What was left of her former jacket has now become an elegant, yet expensive dress.  Her pants shrunk all the way up to around her hips as they thinned into straps and got frilly with a little ribbon appearing.  That soon changed into a pair of black panties while what was Jeff’s penis was now Amanda’s complete pussy with egg producing ovaries.  Her socks grew all the way up and merged covered up her panties, merging together while the color darkened to beige and was smooth as silk and see-through.  This in turn turned the socks into see through pantyhose.  The last remnants on the sneakers was long gone as what Amanda was wearing now is a pair of black three inch high heel shoes.  Then multiple jewelry appeared on her as a bracelet appeared on her left wrist, a pair of diamond stud earrings were on her ears, and a golden necklace wrapped around her neck.  But then, there was a wedding ring with a crystal diamond on her finger, the very same crystal ring from their wedding day.  Amanda’s long red hair then lifted itself up and wrapped itself up in a conservative bum that makes her look mature.  Throughout the entire football game, what was once Jeff the son, was now Amanda the wife, both physically and mentally.<br />
<br />
During the change, reality about them altered as pictures and memories of Jeff was erased from the minds of other family members and friends.  In Jeff’s room, it soon shifted into a guest room for people to visit.  The only thing that didn’t change is the computer that belonged to Jeff as it was still there while the Chronivac is still on, completing John’s request and waiting for a new one.<br />
<br />
Returning to John and the once Jeff, now Amanda, they were making out and groping on the sofa, with John excepting this new change.  But he was still aware that the woman he was kissing what once his son, and it does feel a little weird.  However, he was now his wife and it felt natural to have her back from the living.  After all, Jeff said he would do anything to bring his mother back, even if it means becoming the mother of the house.  Now Jeff got his wish and believe or not, he accepted it completely.  And that’s all that matters.<br />
<br />
As the changes were finished, the game was soon over and the home team had won.  The two could hear the cheers on the TV as Amanda turned to see the game is over.  “Mmm…  Looks like our team has won.” she said in a sultry tone.  John looked at the end of the game as well and said, “Mmm Hmmm…  Sure seems that way.”  It was then that Amanda sat up and said to her husband, “With our daughter still in school and our eldest son away, how about you and I head upstairs and have our very own post show?”  She then gave off a quick wink, meaning they should celebrate this very occasion with their own private party.  John looked to her with eager eyes and said, “I thought you never ask.”  So the two got off the sofa and headed upstairs to their bedroom, ready to celebrate their way.</p>
