# CYOC Archive
This is an archive of the website cyoc.net.

Internet Archive Link: https://archive.org/details/cyocnet

This is a nearly complete archive of the interactive content hosted on cyoc.net as of July 2, 2025, as salvaged from the Wayback Machine. All interactive chapters posted before October 13, 2023, except for those that were deleted from the site before 2025, are included in this archive. After that date, 95% of chapters from late 2023, 72% of chapters from 2024, and 82% of chapters from the first half of 2025 are also included in the archive (see missing.txt below).

The interactives folder contains 203,102 interactive chapters (that's 98% of the 207,372 chapters that were live on July 2, 2025), as well as an additional 1,976 chapters that were deleted at some point before July 2, 2025 (see deleted.txt below). There are a total of 205,078 HTML files, containing the full text of a chapter as well as its metadata and the surrounding formatting. Once downloaded, these HTML files can be opened directly in your internet browser, but the links will not work correctly.

The outlines folder contains a treemap for each of the site's 28 story branches. Each one lists all of the active chapters that were available on July 2, 2025, except for The Madame Illusia, The Ointment Store, and The Jock-Strapped (last saved June 27, 2025), and CYOTF (PG-13) and A Game of Change (last saved June 16, 2025).

**index.txt** is a list of all 207,372 chapters that appear in the outlines mentioned above, in chronological order, with the user IDs and names of their authors attached.

**missing.txt** is a list of all 4,270 chapters that were not archived but do appear in the outlines. These chapters existed on the site as of July 2, 2025, but were not saved by the Wayback Machine at any point. Also, no chapters posted between July 3, 2025, and the beginning of the site's outage on July 8 appear in either the outlines or the archive. If you believe you may have any of these missing chapters saved in your personal collection, please do share them. Some, but definitely not all, of these missing chapters may be found with a more thorough manual search in the Wayback Machine, because some saved pages show the text of their parent chapters. In the event that the original site comes back up, these chapters should be considered a priority for archiving.

**deleted.txt** is a list of all 1,976 chapters that do not appear in the outlines, but were archived anyway. These chapters were either deleted from the site before July 2, 2025, or had their parent chapters deleted, cutting them off from the story branch outline. The search for these was not as thorough as the search for chapters that are listed in the outlines, and there may be more that can be found on the Wayback Machine itself. Most of these chapters were deleted for being fanfiction or spam and may not be wanted in an archive of CYOC stories.
